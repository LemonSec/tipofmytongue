148
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:54,430
you may have differing custom prompts to

you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a device it's actually</font>

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:18,310
anymore and it's not fun so your logic

159
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,710
has to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the custom</font>

until you get somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else's network</font>

165
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,299
be very flexible so the strategies<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

166
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,220
recommend first that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you rethink early</font>

167
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,919
and often with unique text you're

168
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,529
generating and potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

169
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,229
using time tracking

170
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:47,249
as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional thing here's an example</font>

171
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:49,469
of synchronizing the bus first thing

172
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:51,629
there to be known text in the buffer

173
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:54,119
coming back most devices unfortunately

174
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,769
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you say echo so it's not like</font>

175
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:58,649
with it with a shell you could say echo

176
00:06:55,769 --> 00:07:00,389
sunscreen I'm looking for so what we've

177
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:03,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">done in the example here is we've</font>

178
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:06,299
actually forced a known response from

179
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:08,579
the device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just interest</font>

180
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:10,349
special text we're sending a request for

181
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,629
a usage love me and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> note the use of</font>

184
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:18,089
now forced the prompt and by the way if

185
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:24,808
anything times out here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to scream</font>

bloody murder and distant help moving on

00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:30,029
speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and timing devices often have bad</font>

188
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:32,039
reset behavior and I mean by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

189
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:35,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">this context is not trivially</font>

190
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,529
predictable you know if resets takes

191
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,749
three and a half minutes per device that

192
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,249
Lisa takes three minutes per card so

193
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:43,559
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad and it's in control</font>

194
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:46,319
when I do it but the real problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

195
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:48,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">when a reset could take anywhere from 20</font>

196
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,129
seconds to<font color="#E5E5E5"> three minutes and I don't</font>

197
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:55,679
know before the fact you also may find

198
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:57,599
that devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't disconnect when you</font>

199
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,609
think they would this is particularly

200
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,558
horrific on large cisco routers

201
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,119
unfortunately when you tell them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

202
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,579
reload of a large config they start

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reload work but they'll still</font>

00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:08,309
accept incoming connections because

205
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,259
after all you should you should route

206
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:11,609
packets for as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can and</font>

207
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,429
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good except for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

208
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:17,308
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also means except control</font>

209
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:19,078
connections while if you're busy<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

210
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:21,359
all of this homework and housekeeping to

211
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,909
restart so that means if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> logic just</font>

212
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:25,709
says I'll go clipping along I wish you a

real earth says now I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restart</font>

needs to look around to find out what

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other related timing thing is that</font>

226
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,300
many devices don't feel well just

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,060
getting data faster than they wanted I

228
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,370
don't know why a lot of router for

hardware that feels very well with very

230

very high speed connection it's really

231
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,060
cranky if you start pumping data to its

232
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:18,260
control channel at 44 till maybe but

233
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,989
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot now to some</font>

degree you can slow that naturally again

are exciting lots of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up these</font>

288
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,250
beautiful little pop structures with

289
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,960
terminal servers running to all of the

290
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,710
devices that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they got remote control of</font>

291
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,630
power and consult it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

292
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,750
strategy it means that you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

293
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,090
unwritten law of cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that otherwise</font>

294
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,500
you'd be putting somebody on a bus

295
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,210
having to drive a truck<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that's</font>

296
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,920
expensive it's time consuming there's a

297
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,350
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what's really wrong while</font>

298
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,430
they're getting this the downside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

299
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,200
that if you're doing a lot of nation

300
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,550
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that you don't know what</font>

301
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,280
who the last guy could touch the

302
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,199
terminal server was you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

303
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">state they left the device in you know</font>

304
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,820
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your run book tells them to do but</font>

305
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fact maybe they lusted in the enable</font>

306
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,020
mode maybe they got to unlogged in on a

307
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,150
vow to enable that I got to walk away

308
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and find out there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one other piece of</font>

309
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,020
data and then they got hit by another

310
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,150
interrupt so your logic needs to deal

311
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,600
with I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really necessarily know</font>

312
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,890
what state I'm connecting to and it also

313
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,510
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with the fact that terminal</font>

314
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:29,980
servers themselves are known to do kind

315
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,150
of random things on occasion notably if

316
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,950
you need to read that the terminal

317
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,900
server it may helpfully take every

318
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:39,310
device connected to it with it so we've

319
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:46,030
got some discussion in here some

320
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:48,819
examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how do we deal with that so</font>

321
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,650
first you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for what</font>

322
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
take the device again based on the

323
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,880
prompt you get back as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

324
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,980
connect and that suppose a matter of

325
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,080
synchronizing into the mode we expect it

326
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,350
to be in and dealing label security

327
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,820
policy some organizations figure hey

328
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've set up these terminal servers or</font>

329
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,480
so our operations organization from get

330
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,280
out of the connections themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

333
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:17,490
that deals that are state you find it in

334
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,100
look around<font color="#CCCCCC"> as part of your your state</font>

335
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,360
acquisition other organizations say if

336
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,860
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connected the terminal server</font>

337
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,260
you find the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less than</font>

339
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,340
even at last and go deep them up about

340
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,240
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you find out that they didn't</font>

341
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,820
leave it you've got a security event and

342
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,620
so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> your automation logic needs to</font>

343
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,660
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that it's using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the device in</font>

344
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,310
a state that's expected and that it's

345
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,170
triggering the same way your

346
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:48,550
organization would if it finds the

347
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:50,349
device in a SCADA didn't expect so we go

348
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,390
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know do the normal sort of login</font>

349
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,890
thing doing the parameterised<font color="#E5E5E5"> logging to</font>

350
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,689
deal with maybe we're living in a tax

351
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,400
world maybe we're living in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

352
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:01,180
where you get no password challenge at

353
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,850
all maybe you're living in a world where

354
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,829
connecting to a 1900 where you have to

355
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:10,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw it from from menu murdered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

356
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:13,470
command mode and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get it into</font>

357
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,880
basically the access state we expect

358
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,300
then we try to start talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

359
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,200
there's a little bit of logic in here I

360
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,099
can gesture<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of you at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

361
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,870
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later to deal with things like</font>

362
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,460
what if there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> password what does</font>

363
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">this password and I didn't expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

364
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,260
most of those are conditions where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

365
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:35,380
really want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only have your logic</font>

366
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,569
catch it and error out properly but you

367
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,310
also want to alarm off your user is up

368
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,310
to your operator organization properly

369
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,840
the other fun thing about terminal

370
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,600
servers is that they're often the

371
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,370
devices version of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crew console the</font>

372
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,420
device will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheerfully sending output</font>

373
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,800
to them whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

374
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,030
helpful things like my line has just

375
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,040
gone up and down well that's what it

376
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:03,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when configuring a new</font>

377
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,839
line a new interface settings and what

378
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,590
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> means is that your scripts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

379
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,660
going to be getting from<font color="#E5E5E5"> their point of</font>

380
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,770
view spurious messages interspersed

381
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,400
through a real output that they actually

382
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">want you may also have pagination if the</font>

383
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,280
device is desperately certain that every

384
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,270
terminal in the world explain hoerlein

385
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,180
than it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you a more</font>

386
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:24,189
prompts whether you want it or not so

387
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,599
what do you do about that the first

388
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,170
thing you do is you try to suppress the

389
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,190
output you don't expect

390
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:33,589
if you can narrow down what the device

391
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,050
is going to say back to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> then your</font>

392
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,910
logic becomes a lot simpler you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

393
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,649
having nice expect lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say I</font>

394
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,449
expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> a username challenge I'm going</font>

395
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,829
to give it one rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> having blocks</font>

396
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,380
let's say I expect the username

397
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:46,250
challenge but maybe i'm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a weird mode</font>

398
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:51,380
much like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one you saw a couple</font>

399
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:52,850
slides ago um so you try to turn off

400
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,389
everything that might be randomly being

401
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,410
thrown at you but fundamentally the

402
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,720
device is going to do with the device

403
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,329
wants to do some product manager

404
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,860
somewhere found out that the one

405
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:07,399
organisation was building this product

406
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:11,209
for always<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1330 line terminals and</font>

407
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,279
you can't turn off from you all so at

408
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,380
that point yet need to actually do some

409
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,089
interpretation of the data to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

410
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like what you expect and</font>

411
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,240
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general way you're following</font>

412
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,100
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> this good old fashion networking</font>

413
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,589
rule be liberal in what you accept and

414
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,269
conservative and what you send nach

415
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:31,040
suspect as closely as possible but

416
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:32,329
understand that somewhere someone

417
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,699
somewhere will decide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

418
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:37,399
important for a device to recording

419
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:39,050
human readable terms instead of nice

420
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:46,329
consistently formatted<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine readable</font>

421
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:50,149
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere</font>

422
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:51,829
some organizations we talked to have

423
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:54,319
really got a pretty good handle on

424
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,269
firmware management they've got some

425
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:58,368
automated scripts that you basic updates

426
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:02,299
of all the equipment's they've got a lot

427
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:03,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">of and they keep the records they put</font>

428
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything on tftp servers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and make sure</font>

429
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that those are accessible other</font>

430
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,240
organizations have tried a couple of

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">times in a row and decided it's just too</font>

432
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,669
hard and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of to sort</font>

of sets of concerns one our

435
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:26,149
if my underlying command language

436
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:29,209
changed between two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions</font>

439
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,779
there's semantic differences that

change like going from catalast iOS

442
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,120
ideally your structure will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

445
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:56,120
late and you can say perform an update

446
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,799
possibly now later new config because

447
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,840
the world may have changed this

operational or transfer concerns first

the farther away a device that you're

automate something like for more updates

476
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,600
you want to remove the possibility of

477
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,249
accidentally giving the wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> image to</font>

478
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:15,330
the device and of accidentally giving a

486
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,330
couple of slides about failover most

things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your and your operation that</font>

you care about you've got more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one</font>

489
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:42,690
of them are in parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's going</font>

490
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:48,110
to range from devices that don't have

491

any innate sense of parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> ism to</font>

492
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,580
devices that are very strongly coupled

493
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:58,499
so looking into the pics sort of our

494
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:01,740
perfect example of something strongly

495
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:04,409
coupled your first and foremost

496
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,759
automation problem is they have a notion

497
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:07,950
of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's active and which one</font>

498
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,679
standby and of which one is the primary

499
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,940
and which<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones secondary and it may not</font>

500
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,059
match yours because of course your

501
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,509
script is been written assuming I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> fertile world and the device when</font>

507
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,740
similarly if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

508
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,990

devices don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really match the identity</font>

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you thought they did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

also encounter change<font color="#CCCCCC"> voluminous and</font>

513
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,509
they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in the next slides</font>

514
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,840
and you can encounter new config

515
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:52,080
commands that are specific so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of some code that is actually</font>

00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,039
time out logic in here trying to deal

come back in a good way maybe it didn't

coupled failover we found in the pics

give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more than about 200 commands</font>

write that it just goes away because the

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,889
primary and secondary devices are

553
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,090
talking to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and they've</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">learned a stack buffer somewhere</font>

555
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:34,939
important so your logic needs to expect

556
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:38,510
and deal with well known limitations of

557
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:44,510
the device like that what we show here

558
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:47,330
is an example of actually ratcheting

559
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">down how many lines we find out and</font>

making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're always sending</font>

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:55,120
right right configuration commands at

control channel problems bad things that

564
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,250
happen between you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device on the</font>

565
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,180
most common that people code around is

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:10,560
loss of connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you know I do a</font>

567
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,880
temporary disconnect that happens all

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,350
idea because a lot of your configuration

573
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,060
commands will leave the device in a

574
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,459
state where if you just start typing

575
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,340
commands to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again it will now sale in</font>

576
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,560
very weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hard understand ways so</font>

577
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,230
what we found instead is that you need

578
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,330
to actually be pretty clever about did

579
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,660
you get any OS at a time that causes you

580
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:45,000
to not restart your sessions or did you

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,650
get any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of' at a time where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on and you're</font>

00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,360
prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back in to get an eof</font>

right after you<font color="#CCCCCC"> login well that's the</font>

00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,010
in a row which point you say you know

587
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,100
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something really wrong here but</font>

588
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,330
if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eof in the middle of</font>

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,840
setting up a bunch of line statements

590
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:06,689
hmm maybe I soft on myself the other big

591
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,520
idea that we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you want to</font>

592
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,950
distribute control you want to put the

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual point where control is coming</font>

594
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,560
from as close the device as possible

595
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:20,189
again that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> ratchets down your</font>

596
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,200
risk of exposure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the defection</font>

597
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,460
failing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> also makes the session</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

598
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,960
vastly more secure we've had various

599
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,660
carriers who own their entire layer to

600
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,520
say oh no I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumed my wide area</font>

knows the statistic on what fraction

605
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,000
security threats are from inside your

606
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,129
organization and by inside we don't mean

607
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,050
your operators are attacking you we mean

608
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,190
randoms over an accounting get it into

609
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,180
their head that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

612
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,860
so the final couple of wives I wanted to

talk about wanted to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

614
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:06,550
about interpreting sound configurations

into data and using what's already out

616
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:12,610
there in network so we've actually done

617
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,870
a bunch of logic which was our sleeve

618
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,719
luminous to put on the slide deck

619
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:20,139
unfortunately to actually go and pull

system you want to be able to expose the

found configurations retrieve them back

635
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,660
is of course part of your goal here is

636
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,429
to look at what's changing over time and

637
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,620
square that away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

being able to extract some metadata out

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:08,979
of that for reports perhaps for a

640
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:13,709
database control system it's really

641
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:15,850
worthwhile it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also serves template-based</font>

642
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,260
configuration generation where you or

643
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,939
you've decided you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a small</font>

number of kinds of device when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>

configure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dated with the same way</font>

646
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:30,880
and see them a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of metadata finally</font>

647
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:35,140
differential configuration some devices

648
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,059
live in a world where all configuration

649
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,460
statements start with the running state

650
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:41,050
other devices live in a world<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font>

651
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">always have to give them the complete</font>

652
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:46,899
configuration what that requires you do

653
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:51,189
is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some amount of logic support</font>

654
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:52,720
to deal with ni na dare state or<font color="#E5E5E5"> am I</font>

modifying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration already</font>

656
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,809
found that means that your logic needs

657
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,420
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at your configuration</font>

658
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:02,740
your proposed configuration and cut it

659
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,630
apart a little bit it means that you

660
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be able to recognize if you've</font>

661
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:10,220
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of non-invertible commands</font>

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:12,440
and change<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy from automating a</font>

copying an infant again now generally

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,158
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> can become really hard really</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">like non-invertible command the thing</font>

668
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:31,090
that we've seen though is that the

669
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual problem is a lot easier</font>

670
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:37,220
mechanically than the conceptual problem

671
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,440
in fact this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the biggest idea we</font>

672
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,850
found automating device control is if

673
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,039
you sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at devices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

674
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,600
math perspective you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm a lot of</font>

675
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,970
stuff I can configure a lot of different

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">values</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for those configurations I could</font>

677
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:54,020
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a big space of things to</font>

678
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:56,059
deal with and so you say hi I got to go

679
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">and figure out how to edit or interpret</font>

you replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device once over three</font>

your operative is off like a little

704
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:52,459
people actually do with devices are

00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:55,820
relatively bounded they don't ask for

706
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:58,279
them to set up frame-relay connections

that device should be configured and

there's a different card set in here so

00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,230
your logic doesn't need to deal with

be put onto a device it needs to deal

716
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,409
with the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually configure</font>

717
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:19,139
things in their operations and policies

718
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:26,200
you're actually

719
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:27,910
and that happily is tractable just give

720
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">me some example of logic that deals with</font>

721
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:35,290
it this is actually out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pics</font>

722
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,090
driver where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> connect to go through a</font>

723
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,379
very a set of jumpsuits to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with me</font>

724
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,810
because our terminal server in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

725
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,380
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got other logic to deal with</font>

726
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:46,540
along the way like that failover logic

727
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,670
and then we start actually examining

728
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,290
okay what was the old config file I had

729
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,840
what was the what was just giving me and

730
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:55,659
comparing it so we can push those and in

731
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,090
the proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> way or so that we can decide</font>

732
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,360
there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much difference here I</font>

733
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:03,639
have to give up and load<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new context</font>

734
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,500
so with that I'm pretty much done I'm

735
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:12,480
sure Susan wants you to fill out your

736
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:12,480
surveys can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I answer any questions I</font>

737
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,550
guess it's late and we're all ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

738
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">go home</font>
