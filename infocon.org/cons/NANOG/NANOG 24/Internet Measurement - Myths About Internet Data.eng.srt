I'm into measurements I'm going to

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,400
measure the audience here<font color="#CCCCCC"> because i</font>

4

some definitions done a little looser

10

for internet miss which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I did</font>

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,820
before I wrote this up because I wanted

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,078
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of writing the talk to when</font>

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,719
you google for internet miss you get

marketing and sociology and you don't

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,540
need to read this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll read off the most</font>

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,369
interesting ones it's cheap to do

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,070
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the web this stuff really</font>

34
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,840
works in the 90s advertising is flocking

35
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,449
to the web in record numbers and will be

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,710
a savior you can give away the

37
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,180
merchandise as long as you generate

38
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,619
enough eyeballs this is one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,970
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to monetize those eyeballs</font>

40
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,430
if you have a clever URL they will come

41
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,369
people will never pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for content over</font>

42
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,380
the web I can reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> their traditional</font>

43
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,290
advertising brings eyeballs and will

44
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,939
generate much trouble people like to

45
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,950
shop on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web that's my favorite huh</font>

46
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,449
people like a shop on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to buy</font>

47
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,350
on the web because I don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

48
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,509
off let's see it you cost nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

49
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,309
a site up and running the weather is a

50
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,250
reliable commercial activity and just

51
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,909
wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibilities right around corner</font>

52
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:04,299

57
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,890

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,890
emphasize on<font color="#CCCCCC"> North</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay these are not</font>

59
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,149
miss these are fantasies and let me just

60
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,988
distinguish between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Santa season if</font>

fantasies no one actually believes

62
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,260
that's what this list of here is people

63
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,149
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be true and actually people</font>

wrong who believes fantasies marketing

69

advertising lawyers consultants I guess

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,730
maybe addictive drug Jesus creatures who

71
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,950
gets hurt when people believe fantasies

72
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,540

global recession because people all

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,650
right looking at the data so i get a

96
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,239
little preaching on this one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

97
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,920
talk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mix in as you can</font>

98
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,170
tell from sociology and random

99
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,399
non-linear leaps of logic this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

100
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,829
about internet myths relevant to

101
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,530
engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is about internet data</font>

102
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,120
i categorize them to be four different

103
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,710
categories I've given us talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give</font>

104
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,480
talking point internet measurement and

105
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,410
data and i divide things up into four

106
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,929
categories because it gives this

107
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,510
pretense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have any organization in</font>

108
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,500
my research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the categories are and</font>

109
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,920
i'll describe them a little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

110
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll go through this list of myth walk</font>

111
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,500
you through them in the talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'll</font>

112
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">put the slide up again and you can get</font>

113
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this on the web so i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

114
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">go through go to these things now but</font>

115
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,880
the upside is that there's crap all over

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,159
all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of measurements that people</font>

117
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,690
believe that's just for wrong and this

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,940
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff i came up with in a week i</font>

119
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,230
could come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with another same amount</font>

120
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these in another week at reference</font>

121
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,100
why so many no real measurement<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

122
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can skip these next three</font>

123
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides and you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pace to them because</font>

124
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone at nana nose and I've given</font>

125
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,210
this kind of crap he's in years these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

126
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,590
could write a book I guess but it would

127
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,150
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really short because it would just be</font>

128
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,219
these three slides why the internet

129
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,870
isn't measured internet 16<font color="#CCCCCC"> any access to</font>

130
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">measure everything's moving too fast is</font>

131
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,310
no equilibrium all the measurements will

132
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,290
suck basically they don't help is peace

133
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,870
all but I excuse me to solve I excuse me

134
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,740
to invest a lot of effort and deployment

135
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,730
and cost control those days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff so</font>

136
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,910
losing battle even though everybody

137
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,810
admits it more data would be better

138
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,160
researchers of benefit vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

139
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,200
benefit people come ask me all the time

140
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve unfortunately the ones who</font>

141
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,450
would bear the cost of doing this one

142
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,770
until we can sort of rearrange the

143
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">cross-section and have somebody who</font>

144

147
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,190
can do it is the internet i guess and

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:34,430
drug industry isn't any but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few ways</font>

149
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">two ways to do it besides that is build</font>

Megan Leslie possible that's kind of

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,699
reaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now make them less</font>

153
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:45,050
unprofitable and then you could do it

154
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,659
just make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it illegal to measure or</font>

155
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,009
something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got regulatory and</font>

156
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:51,740
technical useful or economical useful

157
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,659
food so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in the last five</font>

158
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,629
or six years instead of measuring the

159
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:58,819
internet and hey I was busy but a lot of

160
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:01,129
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't busy looking at data so</font>

161
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,779
and release code is completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> insane</font>

162
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:06,110
even crazier than I am it was a

those predictions in this way everybody

00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:32,539
has to go by his boxes I reckon I don't

181
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,129
uncovered a lot of the police that were

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,710
going on before he wrote a thicker right

183
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,449
so back in nineteen<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety five people</font>

184
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,680
are starting to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this elusive</font>

00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,180

186
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,310
traffic's doubling every 90 days and you

187
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,189
actually hurt here<font color="#E5E5E5"> people really respect</font>

188
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,759
and you trust this number the reality is

189
00:06:55,189 --> 00:07:00,740
that um I mean the last time real stats

190
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,229
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back Lenore available with NSFNET</font>

191
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,419
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many coaches oh this tutorial</font>

192
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:08,089
on sunday was talking about NSFNET<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps</font>

193
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,849
which lasted into like 1995 in nineteen

194
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:12,110
middle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1985 I think they stopped</font>

195
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:13,789
during the staff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can still get</font>

196
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">all those stats at some ftp directions</font>

197
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,509
and so there was like three months at

198
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,789
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the NSFNET bathroom right</font>

199
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,759
when the web was coming out when traffic

200
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,139
doubled like for 13 months period and

201
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,969
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the last number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

202
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,339
would refer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you for like a year or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 18</font>

203
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:30,319
months even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> chubbuck never grew</font>

204
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,319
that fast again on and well with any

205
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,520
numbers or evidence than anybody has

206
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,810
doesn't stop the financial markets from

207
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,849
continuing to do that number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

208
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,089
generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the irrational capital</font>

209
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:42,860

six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 90-day governing we may in</font>

whatever that would mean the map<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

216
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,030
doesn't really work out you see these

217
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,620
bullets here basically i did this<font color="#CCCCCC"> math</font>

218
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,919
assume you have happened half a billion

users key ones using it around the clock

220
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,979
that's what that's what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> factor of 16</font>

221
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,258

233
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:41,299
actually when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally realized how</font>

234
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,529
much traffic wasn't growing on the

235
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,779
internet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have access</font>

236
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,950
to real date on a minute so from my

237
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:48,890
perspective that's actually fairly

238
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:52,160
pathetic and there are some legal said

239
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:56,630
it willingness to ignore or invent data

<font color="#E5E5E5">no favor well okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off let's talk</font>

241

<font color="#E5E5E5">about trade-offs so there's certainly</font>

242
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,329
cost and I argued a text level was a

243

getting a tremendous amount of emphasis

bit 1090 rule or 20 80 depending on who

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are who you're talking to you but</font>

433
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,380
there's a prevailing belief that you

know ten percent of the floors<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

constituting ninety percent of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">over the map it's um you know it really</font>

440
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,270
depends what kind of applications you

441
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,219
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there never we've never seen a</font>

444
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,319
and the change is not only by sight but

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,310
also by<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of day again based on what</font>

year or whatever many months it goes

from december to December so that's a

you have something something something

of a fantasy the milk might be that

498
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,840
there's no there's still not a killer

499
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,949
app we haven't seen the killer app yet

500
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,870
which I do hear a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think just awareness and multi super fun</font>

502
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,189
and almost going on there but it is a

503
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,860
definitely a killer app and I'll walk

504
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,179
you through it here there we go Heidi

something is at your ass when every

513
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,590
it's the killer app that it takes a

which case the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets count would be</font>

519
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:34,200
smaller because the fifth count would be

had a lot of packets here to this

one number of IP addresses that are

well sorry Sarge million yeah that the

831
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:39,049
question is in your end-to-end studies

did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually target users which</font>

inter-country traffic stays in the

858
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,320
country is there like for example

859
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,270
traffic between Japan from Japan to

860
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,389
Japan so we have this monitoring point

of the commercial bathroom in san jose

862
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:53,820
and what we end up seeing there is a ton

863
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:55,890
of and it's a real estate as it's going
