slideshow<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm giving a short</font>

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,349
little talk on a project that's been

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:16,740
going on in the IETF for almost a year

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:19,230
now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think introduction so at the 90s</font>

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,089
feeding about a year ago during the

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,400
operations of network management area

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,698
meeting there was some<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion about</font>

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">how what the IETF was doing in terms of</font>

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,009
network management didn't really match

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,700
what the network operators wanted to do

11
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:37,469
so so what was decided to do was try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,969
do some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of outreach where the IETF</font>

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,440
wind up the network operation said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

14
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,700
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys really want let us know</font>

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,349
so we can build it purpose of this or

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,170
this helps agenda for future work at the

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,020
IETF why waste time doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's going to use and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,109
provide recommendations to vendors on

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,460
what they ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be focusing on so</font>

21
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,229
they're from all sorts of meetings held

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,840
with various operated groups last May

23
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,710
and nanog there was a meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,240
network operators couple I ETS we went

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,030
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the right meeting in Prague last</font>

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,919
fall and the usenix Lisa conference in

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,420
San Diego this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very</font>

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,729
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a</font>

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Enterprise operators environment as</font>

30
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,340
opposed to nicely operators but it

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,140
surprised us that many of their comments

32
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,500
were the same as<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we begin from the</font>

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:36,000
ISPs notably though these<font color="#E5E5E5"> were not</font>

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,650
Microsoft operators so they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> confess requirements that won't go</font>

36
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,439
there there is a current internet draft

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,720
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already a bit out of date and</font>

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,979
those promised a revision real soon now

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,750
the revisions mainly going to revise the

40
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,200
document structure so that it's less

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,549
free flowing and more organized<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">include some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the latest thinking as</font>

43
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,320
it'll result of last couple of meetings

44
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,509
as all of all this is to take this

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,460
document try to get consensus on it send

46
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,020
it through the IETF last call procedure

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,060
so we can publish that as an

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,950
informational RFC at that point

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,620
the area directors can refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it when</font>

50
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,209
they're deciding what to do and vendors

51
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,110
can refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to when they're trying to</font>

52
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,489
decide with the bill here's some of the

53
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements that have been talking</font>

54
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:26,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that should go in there top of the</font>

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,940
list is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ascii communications people like</font>

56
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,920
to type in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ascii they don't want to type</font>

57
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:35,349
in binary or<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1 or anything like that</font>

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,849
so there needs to be a nice common way

59
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,340
of getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a boxing at the</font>

60
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,319
septum and you see things back it would

61
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">be nice if there was a common syntax and</font>

62
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,548
vocabulary for a common things like

63
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,859
setting up an interface and turning on

64
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:50,830
bgp and all that and not to have each

65
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,860
vendor implement their own security

66
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be built in something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssh</font>

67
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,930
although documents not going to specify

68
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,849
a specific protocol that was something

69
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,540
decided on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last meeting but</font>

70
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:08,410
security is has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a requirement one</font>

71
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,459
that keeps coming up is you have to be

72
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,780
able to ask a device what its

73
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,690
configuration is and it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

74
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:18,880
to tell you one would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

75
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:24,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">no-brainer but it's not some open issues</font>

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,680
still are do we tailor the output so a

77
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,239
human can read it or so a computer can

78
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,950
read it or both and if both how do we do

79
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,980
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> other two separate paths to separate</font>

80
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,298
output streams you said a mode or you

81
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,660
try to somehow come for the least common

82
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:43,239
denominator that works for both current

83
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,060
discussion going on is how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make</font>

84
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,319
sure that we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

85
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,280
large networks to automate their

00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:53,828
configurations and another up Lanisha

nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it something that we should</font>

90
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually specify an enormous document</font>

91
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,970
like this so main reason appears to ask

92
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,048
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the help please read the draft</font>
