00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,259
good morning I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm the</font>

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,780

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,680
presentation is based on some work that

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,180
was done for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF traffic</font>

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,269
engineering working group we produced a

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,490

that best current practice as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

some of the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> material to that</font>

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:44,489
and then I'll open up for questions if

you can feel free to send me<font color="#CCCCCC"> email so</font>

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,000
again the scope<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is to present</font>

19
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,210
how CMW does traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering and</font>

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,060
some of the reasoning behind it this is

<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one true way no matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what some</font>

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,210
private discussions but this is the way

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,979
that works for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and has been fairly</font>

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:23,250
successful using<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a number of</font>

28
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:36,119
of routers on its network and that was

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:39,119
through 97 98 on 96 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> thereabouts-- the</font>

ds3 direct router to router circuits

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,409
were replaced with OC 3 ATM circuits and

32
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,869
the routers were completely meshed over

33
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,850
an ATM course so every aggregation

34
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,829
router on the cable wireless network was

35
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,559
mesh to every other router on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">John network time then in 1998 we had a</font>

38
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:08,869
network event we added six or eight more

39
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,880
routers in somewhere in Chicago I

40
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,550
remember if it was Willow Springs or

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,480

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:25,790

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,250
meltdown it was an educational

experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an educational</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

47
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,989
that lasted about a week as we rebuilt

48
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:38,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and got everything stable</font>

49
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:39,860
again at that point we decided that we

50
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,859
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add some hierarchy to the</font>

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">network to reduce the flat IGP mesh at</font>

52
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,769
the time of the event there were over

53
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,200
380 routers in the mesh accounting for

54
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,060
approximately 30,000 PVCs in the network

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,760
in each router was maintaining

56
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:00,170
approximately 760 direct<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITP</font>

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,910
associations again<font color="#CCCCCC"> very flat not a lot</font>

58
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,679
of traffic flowing over those<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,340
associations or routing information

60
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,180
because every router was directly meshed

61
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,890
but still a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit too much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

62
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:20,900

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:22,850
up with but first bullet point is the

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,139
same as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last one the last line must</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">been doing this on a plane or something</font>

66
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:32,660
currently in since 1998 we've added a

67
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,989
level of hierarchy so now aggregation

68
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">routers I should have a diagram here and</font>

69
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:41,630
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't I'm sorry aggregation routers in</font>

70
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,670

71
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,850
other aggregation routers in a pop as

72
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,940
well as the core routers in a pop and

73
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,680
then the core routers in each pop or

74
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,139
mesh to every other core router in every

75
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,950
other pop so we have a two layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

76
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,569
level mesh fairly common<font color="#CCCCCC"> today that</font>

77
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,810
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us there's no more than</font>

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:18,600

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,500
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do do now getting</font>

82
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,469
this in a minute as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do calculations</font>

83
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:30,090
of all of our traffic engineering layout

84
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,280
offline so before we added the layer of

85
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,409
hierarchy it was taking us approximately

86
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,229
four hours to calculate the traffic

87
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,840
engineering layout of the network using

88
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,840
some homegrown tools with the decrease

89
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the diameter of the meshes in</font>

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,640
discrete meshes that time period that

91
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">time has gone down to about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 minutes</font>

92
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,360
we've also done some soccer optimization

93
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,690
but the big thing has been going from

94
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,880
meshes that calculated 380 routers in a

95
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:03,480
mesh two routers two meshes to calculate

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:06,150
no more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 80 in a particular mesh the</font>

core routers in each pops<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit in level</font>

102
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:26,010

even in most failure scenarios we like

it offline and we do it at layer 2 not

147
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:33,330
adjust metrics in one place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve a</font>

148
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:36,060
local problem you create problems in

149
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,889
other localities so our belief is we

150
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,340
prefer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> layout</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic flows at</font>

151
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:44,300
layer 2 and use<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP simply for link</font>

152
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,299
failure detection

153
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:53,370
in our case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the IGP our igp is is</font>

154
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,430
only for link state signaling and in

155
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:59,550
normal and most failure mode scenarios

156
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:02,120
so every element on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network has at</font>

157
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,630
least two paths laid out over separate

158
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,940
layer two halves to get to every other

159
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">element on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network either its core</font>

161
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,370
between core routers therefore is is

162
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,860
simply indicates that the link is

163
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,599
available it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not used for</font>

165
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,949
routing as if both the primary and

166
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,940
backup links went away due to different

167
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:31,219
failure mode group failures where we

168
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,649
lost both the primary and backup

169
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:37,469
resources at which point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I GP would be</font>

170
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:40,409
used to find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop route to the</font>

171
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:43,709

172
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,839
very rarely happens on our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network I</font>

173
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,279
could probably count I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in kimmel</font>

174
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,570
wireless three years they probably count

175
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:57,750
on one hand the number of times we've

176
00:08:48,570 --> 00:09:00,870
actually had<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop failures one of</font>

177
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,850
the things is our metric deployment we

178
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,310
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a small subset of</font>

179
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,399
metrics because everything has direct

180
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,739
adjacencies we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> only use two</font>

181
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,870
metrics on the network one to indicate a

182
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,120
primary path one to indicate a backup

183
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,890
path we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> MIT by a certain links as</font>

184
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,270
expensive so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a multi-hop</font>

185
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:26,339
failure we do end up using local

186
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:31,800
resources rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> global resources</font>

187
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:35,190
to restore that failure so the example

188
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,579
would be we might use a metric of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

189
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to indicate a primary route between</font>

192
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:49,649

193
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,020
say to indicate for all links<font color="#E5E5E5"> going over</font>

194
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,579
the ocean which would prevent traffic

195
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,890
going from Chicago to New York that lost

196
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:59,640
both the primary and backup route would

197
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,270
pick another set of routes in the US

198
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,850
where

199
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,730
other than prom boning over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> London</font>

200
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:09,180
and come back over the global mesh so

201
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,010
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> add long latency or that are</font>

202
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,530
valuable resources we tend to protect

203
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:22,560
with slightly higher metrics in case of

204
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:24,540
a double a double failure next is what

205
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,069
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing for our lair to traffic</font>

214
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:55,440
are some others in there but all in all

215
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:59,130
we had no problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with using ATM at</font>

216
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,440
worked it was a handy tool but the lack

217
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:05,640
of anything faster no c12 interfaces on

218
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:10,710
routers and the overhead on some

219
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:14,220
expensive links became a problem so we

220
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:17,490
actually then started looking for

221
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,530
alternatives and settled on mpls is

222
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:24,230
probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most reasonably supported</font>

223
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:27,329
solution from our vendors to replace ATM

224
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,650
we do treat it as basically in the

225
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,260
traffic engineering core there's

226
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,240
actually two separate mpls networks at

227
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,590
cable and wireless one network is a

228

<font color="#E5E5E5">network that provides MPLS based</font>

229

230
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,240
3<font color="#CCCCCC"> bpms and then there's the MPLS traffic</font>

239

in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use frame relay resources i</font>

254
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,499

<font color="#CCCCCC">use a PVC like signaling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font>

256

VLC is between the core routers and the

00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:05,049
traffic engineering switches the MPLS

258
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:11,860
switches so the IG bees are between the

<font color="#E5E5E5">really happen we would consider this</font>

263
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,819
would be when the bandwidth required for

264
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:26,619
any router to router pair approaches the

265
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:30,128
bandwidth available from a single lambda

266
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:33,549
so until a core router to core router

267
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:38,069
flows say<font color="#E5E5E5"> again on this case ones in</font>

268
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:41,019
them to New York or Chicago to

269
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:44,759
Washington approaches 10 gigabits

270
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:48,970
there's really no reason to use lambdas

271
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:50,649
to using active traffic engineering

272
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,350
layer rather than mpls and in fact

273
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,549
there's some disadvantages to doing it

274
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,559
namely that for each lambda you need

275
00:13:54,549 --> 00:14:00,129
very expensive router interfaces and

276
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,618
router and router space on the router to

277
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:05,439
places interfaces so if you're talking

278
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fraction the core router</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decor</font>

279
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:11,110
router flows being a fraction of a

280
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,809
lambda it makes more<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to aggregate</font>

281
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,360
at the land at the MPLS label level

282
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:19,550
level rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lambda</font>

283
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,810
the other is the cost report on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> o</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exy</font>

284
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,579
would need to be significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheaper</font>

285
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,770
than the equivalent bandwidth port on

286
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,740
the MPLS switch that's probably a

287
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,480
reasonable argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could make today</font>

288
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,120
but both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to occur</font>

289
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,320
and before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would consider replacing</font>

they would be statically signaled static

if we have a significant loss of

406
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,070
of a whole undersea cable system we may

407
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,570
do a tactical redesign of the network

408
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:32,629
because usually undersea cable systems

409

unless there's a major a major hit

416
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,240

stick at every six month planning cycle

afterwards the analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> you made about</font>

router to router pairs and the 10 gigs

440
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,320
being sort of a point where you would

prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use wavelengths I was curious</font>

442
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,840
if that was simply a financial analysis

443
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,149
or is that really a broader analysis and

444
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,510
that is a price for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit point here</font>

445
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:06,969
hitting it's more than a financial

446

analysis if you're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

447
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,570
flowing a gig or two gig or three big

448
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:19,230
across the link between two router pairs

449
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:22,779
why drop to one expensive 10 gig

450
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:27,190
interfaces on your on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mpls traffic</font>

458
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,800
going to be for flipping that box

doing everything offline does it mean

464
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:02,659
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have only explicit honesty yes</font>

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">explicitly routed all space right then</font>

466
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,270
in case of failures then do you have

467
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,970
explicit buck up Phyllis p or how do you

468
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:13,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">manage that we basically have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

explicit LSPs each made up of to

explicitly routed paths yes just a

clarification<font color="#E5E5E5"> for cement a question</font>

472
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,820
today your explicit rotted LSPs are you

473
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,550
using RSVP to set them up or is that all

set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up statically also there's Yves</font>

475
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:39,230
sorry they're using RSVP to be set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

476
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:42,920
and as you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're out at</font>

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:58,610
we're looking at what could best be

482
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,620
termed regional repair so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

483
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:04,219
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at local repair or faster you're</font>

out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were looking at is basically</font>

485
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:10,640
end-to-end repair but the ends may not

486
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:13,460
be the entire end end of the network it

487
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,000
may not be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> origination and</font>

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,710
destination IP router there may be

489
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,930
multiple LSPs stitched together along

490
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,990
the path to give me a restoration time

491
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:29,920
of a certain number of milliseconds and

492
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,920
signaling any other questions

493
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,980
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
