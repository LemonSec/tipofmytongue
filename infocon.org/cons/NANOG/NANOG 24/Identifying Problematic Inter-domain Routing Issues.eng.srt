step towards a better understanding of

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,570
BGP is by trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify what has</font>

presenting you some results of our work

<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

tools we've used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for deriving these</font>

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,589
results and this tool is called

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,850
character and it helps answering

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,620
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about bgp so please let me try</font>

22
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,739
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a short overview of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,690
it operates mainly on two levels the

24
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,509
first level takes care of the processing

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the raw data and all low level</font>

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,880
details so it provides you with an

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,340
intermediate abstraction level and on

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,259
this abstraction basis you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,360
develop useful functions for the

30
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,290
classification and characterization of

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,539
BGP updates so this is exactly how the

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tool Works you collect your raw data</font>

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,200
from your router's with tools like the

36
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,560
with this intermediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> level for the</font>

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,960
automatic classification between and

within two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different peering points so</font>

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just state the time period and the</font>

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,729

44
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,589
so you may write your own functions or

45
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,380
you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> already written functions that</font>

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,270
come along with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> check package so in</font>

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,789
the reminder of the talk i would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

48
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,728
introduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to one function is called</font>

49
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,780
route change events and this function

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">tries to identify different kinds of</font>

51
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes like slapping</font>

52
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,780
the session reset update birth and so on

53
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:23,140
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> characterization is of course</font>

54
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,460
done by processing all of the updates

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,959
there are two different interesting

56
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,090
contexts in which you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> view an update</font>

57
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,290
first of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> all updates for the same</font>

58
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,540
prefix but there's also an interesting

59
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,579
context in which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can view updates</font>

60
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,269
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the updates that appear within a</font>

61
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,730
short time period so our function works

62
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,660
in the following ways it takes to

63
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:54,590
surrounding table dumps as an input<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

64
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:57,109
we start with a be the first table down

65
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,630
as a reference for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the updates and</font>

66
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,190
we processes the updates and classifies

67
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,900
them according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some rules and</font>

68
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,079
concepts<font color="#CCCCCC"> which which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will explain</font>

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,290
later and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to rebuild the</font>

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,470
second table and this is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

71
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:17,299
identify missing updates and so verifies

72
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:20,540
your raw data so that's the input what's

73
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:26,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the output we show in the output</font>

74
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:28,340
so we show each update in one line and

75
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,430
depend our characterization to the end

76
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,630
of the line so this looks a little bit

77
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,720
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> marriage route b2a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> output but with</font>

78
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:42,799
one big difference our output is first

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,489
sorted by the prefix and then by time so

80
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,670
in this example we have two updates here

81
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:52,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eighteen thousand ninety six dot 50 /</font>

82
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:59,299
24 and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first to update for the 80s</font>

83
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:01,480
96 dot 150 / 24 so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

84
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,780
data where this example and derived from

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:10,190
so we used our tool to characterize the

86
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:12,739
updates for one week we take the data

87
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,900
set was collected and published about

88
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:18,290
three weeks ago from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights risk</font>

89
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,500
project and you all know these kinds of

90
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,260
plus we show on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-axis this one week</font>

91
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,090
in mid-january and on the y-axis is the

92
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,150
number of updates during through our

93
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,609
bins

94
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,919
different colors means different appears

95
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,910
and so on you see more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and less intense</font>

96
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,710
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> periods and what is noticeable here</font>

97
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,350
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large spike on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the left</font>

98
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,109
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph that is due to a</font>

99
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:48,190
collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> point failure and after the</font>

100
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:52,330
session reestablished each<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer sends</font>

101
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:55,300
about 107,000 updates to the collection

102
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,760
points so that sets a very large flag on

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,070
the left side so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

104
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,219
overview of our data as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just mentioned</font>

105
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,469
the output<font color="#CCCCCC"> is appended to the end of</font>

106
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,710
each line so this results in very long

107
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,420
lines and just didn't fit on any<font color="#CCCCCC"> flights</font>

108
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:15,659
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> splitted them for the presentation</font>

109
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:18,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">into pieces so we start this very simple</font>

110
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,830
classifications just by counting the

111
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:24,450
number of each update the time to the

112
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,590
previous prefix we print the

113
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,080
classification which correct labovitz at

114
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,840
all introduces which is a a tubes and a

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">80s and then a more detailed explanation</font>

116
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,070
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly has changed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ucas past</font>

117
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:41,890
affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> heavy extra actual pass through</font>

118
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">gass changed or it's just one is</font>

119
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:48,849
repeating<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's on AF number several</font>

120
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:52,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">times the first we call it a s task rate</font>

121
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,820
change and the second we call a policy

122
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,960
change so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the AAS pass getting longer</font>

123
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,510
or shorter or does he a number of from

124
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">assa the same like in this example what</font>

125
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,789
else has changed the community string is

126
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,770
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example has been changed and of</font>

127
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,640
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the original attribute would</font>

128
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:15,010
have been changed we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

129
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:20,169
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the word origin here or as</font>

130
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:22,840
well so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit too much</font>

131
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,850
information to visualize so for the

132
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:30,640
visualization we group them into three

133
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:32,530
classes first MCAS path changes the

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,930
second class is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy change which</font>

135
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,929
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one a SS repeating its own AF</font>

136
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,000
number more or less often<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the third</font>

137
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:44,160
class are all

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,530
other attribute changes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> three classes</font>

139
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,890
results in eight possible categories

140
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:53,400
when update might fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> him so an update</font>

141
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:56,820
might have only changes to the AAS pass

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:00,479
nothing else or it might have changes in

143
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:03,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Susie AAS pass as well but also a policy</font>

144
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,210
change or it falls in all three

145
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,480
categories and so on so this plot is

146
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,609
again for our one week time period this

147
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,130
is a relative clause which means we take

148
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,590
the percentage of updates falling in

149
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:20,180
this or that<font color="#E5E5E5"> category and plot them in</font>

150
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:24,539
an additive fashion so the result must

151
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,790
be all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time one hundred percent this</font>

152
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,310
is indicated by the yellow line I think

153
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,350
it's a little bit difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the</font>

154
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,630
yellow line at one hundred percent but

155
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,750
believe me<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a yellow line right</font>

156
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:39,000
as one hundred percent so you can

157
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,190
interpret the distance for example

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,370
between the light blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

159
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:48,390
slightly under fifty percent and the

160
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">pink line as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of updates at</font>

161
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,890
the percentage of updates that arrived

162
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,180
with only an attribute change which is

163
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,719
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example roughly about</font>

164
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five percent so you see here</font>

165
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,520
again our collection point failure which

166
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:08,580
falls completely in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yellow category</font>

167
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:11,909
and to describe obvious because we use

168
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,580
the tables as referring as references

169
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:18,360
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the failure and get all</font>

170
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,729
the updates we announced so so we have

171
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,310
supplicated an announcement of the

172
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:27,539
tables which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing has</font>

173
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:30,840
changed so what else<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting is</font>

174
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,229
that from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> button to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> green line</font>

175
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:38,789
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also slightly under fifty</font>

176
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:43,140
percent all changes due to a s path

177
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:46,920
changes so the output of our tools looks

178
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,959
in this a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in details but</font>

179
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,819
I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time here to go into</font>

180
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:58,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">details so next the output</font>

181
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:00,440
of our tools will print the geode AAS

182
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,380
pass because the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past is</font>

183
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,660
providing the connectivity that means

184
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the old a estar somehow has lost</font>

185
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,329
the connectivity so it's printed as AF

186
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:13,790
numbers but also we<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows the percentage</font>

187
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,780
of prefixes that are still associated

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">with an AS versus a total</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

192
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,990

193
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,020
very low percentages years and are

194
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,690
marked with an asterisk so this will

195
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:40,970
only the changes between the consecutive

196
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:43,850
updates let's look at updates with equal

197
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,250
attributes so if you see a set of

198
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,860
attributes for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time because</font>

199
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change if there are two</font>

200
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,140
consecutive updates with equal

201
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,620
attributes these are duplicated changes

202
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,870
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first and society to update other</font>

203
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,510
same dessert would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be called a flapping</font>

204
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,790
change and if the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the false</font>

205
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,160
have equal attributes this earth would

206
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,990
because a reconversion change according

207
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,589
to the classical case where you have

208
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,920
your best<font color="#E5E5E5"> path that's number one that</font>

209
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:18,410
may be stable in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and then you</font>

210
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,620
have a wrist wrong that's number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

211
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a failure or something like</font>

212
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this withdrawal is replaced by</font>

213
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:30,890
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative route that's number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

214
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:35,090
and after the reparation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure</font>

215
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:37,580
see a best<font color="#E5E5E5"> path gets available again so</font>

216
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,230
that's number four and so number one and

217
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,410
number four and have equal<font color="#CCCCCC"> set of</font>

218
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:46,160
attributes and so number four would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

219
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:48,110
for the reconversion change so the

220
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,449
output of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reflectors by</font>

221
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:55,010
calculating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the distance to the last</font>

222
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:57,140
equal update so a distance of two needs

223
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lapping a distance of 30 reconversion</font>

224
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,670
change on and so on so next we print the

225
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:09,190
number of updates where this

226
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:11,530
where this first akula's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 in this</font>

227
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,450
case means that its first this<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of</font>

228
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,689
attributes occurs for the first time

229
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,120
inter table and so on we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have more</font>

230
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,670
information about flapping and<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

231
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversion change there but let's look</font>

232
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:29,740
at some nice plots this is again<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

233
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:34,349
relative plot over the time the black

234
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:37,570
line indicates<font color="#E5E5E5"> the introduction of new</font>

235
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,660
attributes which is in this case about

236
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,820
twenty one percent as a mean and don't

237
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,650
get confused this new prefixes that are

238
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,620
introduced which is of course less than

239
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:50,650
one percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think in this example it</font>

240
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:54,120
was 0.4 percent or something like that

241
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:58,030
so this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduction of new</font>

242
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:05,070
attributes so we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

243
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:08,980
applicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates but except for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

244
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,690
collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of failure and we have</font>

245
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,810
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of flapping that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the distance</font>

246
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:17,650
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue and the red line and so</font>

247
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:20,670
on the trend towards is a smaller number

248
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:23,680
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new changes is quite obviously</font>

249
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,569
because at the end of the week more

250
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,219
information is of course known to the

251
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:33,580
system so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remarkable that there</font>

252
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:39,150
are still such an amount of new updates

253
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:41,890
that are introduced to the system so

254
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:45,610
next we look at the inter arrival times

255
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:47,949
for the various kinds of updates this

256
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,050
plots here shows the density

257
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,390
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logarithm of the</font>

258
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,810
inter arrival times between equal

259
00:12:52,390 --> 00:13:00,280
updates using the logarithm of the inter

260
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:03,910
arrival times let us still see something

261
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,760
on the x-axis and still be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

262
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,920
compare the areas so two areas of the

263
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,210
same size here corresponds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the same</font>

264
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,229
probability so as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just told you on the</font>

265
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">x-axis</font>

266
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,950
we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of seconds</font>

267
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,070
logarithmically scales between equals

268
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:25,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">sets of attributes and on the y-axis the</font>

269
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,680
probability so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see most of</font>

270
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wii updating the same attributes</font>

271
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:37,030
happens within 15 minutes let's see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

272
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get in hand finger between 15</font>

273
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:44,500
minutes and maybe are still true to one

274
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,630
hour but for the flapping and to the

275
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,250
greater distances this drops

276
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:53,350
significantly at the end of the curve so

277
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,170
let's look a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit into possible</font>

278
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,290
causes for this for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> fashion</font>

279
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">recess it is known that fashion resets</font>

280
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,630
have a deep impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> DGP you the</font>

281
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,900
solutions to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem are already</font>

282
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:10,540

287
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:34,510
our tools analyzes all a SS that are

291
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:48,310
fraction of the routing table which is

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,920
updated recently so this means for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ejf</font>

293
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:54,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">we keep track</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of which prefixes are</font>

296
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:03,040
then we count for a six<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes window</font>

297
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:06,640
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these prefixes have been</font>

298
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,280
updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the resulting percentage</font>

299
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,069
turned out to be a good harvest speak

300
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:16,030
for identifying session<font color="#E5E5E5"> resets and this</font>

301
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:19,600
is something like the validation or for

302
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:22,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is again a dentist's exotic on</font>

303
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,760
the x axis we have the fraction of the

304
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,280
prefixes associated with an S which

305

306
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,699
of probability so in this case we

307
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:37,880
distinguish we distinguish between

308
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:41,330
originating a SS and transiting a SS so

309
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:46,220
an originating a SS just the last a s on

310
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:48,620
the past and our definition now so in

311
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to our right data we have here</font>

312
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:56,450
also data available from a local<font color="#E5E5E5"> german</font>

313
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:59,750
i esteem so for the originating a SS and

314
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:02,930
there's a nice peak right over one

315
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:06,700
hundred percent this is green and blue

316
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:09,770
lines and this peak shows a

317
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,890
significantly higher probability for

318
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:16,730
originating a s to exchange their whole

319
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:22,130

<font color="#E5E5E5">example than forty percent also and we</font>

321
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:30,170
would call every would consider these

322
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:33,710
updates in this peak as a part of a

323
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:36,439
possible session reset so for transiting

324
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:39,410
a SS we don't have this very nice peak

325
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,760
there but on the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand we don't</font>

326
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:47,120
expect that transiting a SS exchange

327
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,160
their full and routing tables that are

328

associated with a full<font color="#E5E5E5"> associated</font>

329
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:56,300

330
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:59,720
much higher connectivity of transiting a

331
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:03,500
SS so I can explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the talk to</font>

332
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:09,400
you how we managed this but it was also

333
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:14,780
am very good so the output<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our tools</font>

334
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:17,930
don't only a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marxist vision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asterix but</font>

335
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:21,020
also a princely number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sss are</font>

336
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:25,220

337
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:28,430
is a SS by printing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their AF numbers so</font>

338
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:32,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next question you are probably</font>

339
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:37,040
asking for is how big is a problem so

340
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,809
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a relative leap lot over</font>

341
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,090
our time period the

342
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:44,299
the red line is the percentage of

343
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,668
updates that are marked as being part of

344
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:50,090
a possible session reset and the bus

345
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:53,539
until the blue line<font color="#CCCCCC"> R Us of the updates</font>

346
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:59,899
I think I don't have to comment this

347
00:17:53,539 --> 00:18:04,429
anymore so further classifications

348
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:07,129
include an array of updates in seconds

349
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:11,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if this rate exceeds some certain</font>

350
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:16,610
threshold it's been marked as as one of

351
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:19,610
these little geeks there and so that's

352
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,860
it for for our current classification we

353
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">really would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what</font>

please drop us an email and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

357
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:37,418
further and analyzes the adversity

358
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:39,678
behavior of the update so when a route

359
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:43,580
changes or a change to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

361
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,369
single update is created but whether

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:55,549
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are several updates update us I</font>

363

364
00:18:55,549 --> 00:19:03,080
more updates for the same prefix within

365
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:05,720
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> short time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period we would consider</font>

366
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,590
these prefixes if update as being part

367
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,710
of the same update first so like someone

368
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,668
is routing packets into flows we are

369
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:18,169
grouping an update in this way together

370
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:22,299
so we can now look at the

371
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:25,940
characteristics of such update works and

372
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:30,139
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a situation of these</font>

373
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:33,649
updaters this is a density plot again

00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:36,529
logarithmically scales<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the duration</font>

375

of the update first on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-axis and on</font>

376
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:41,840
the y-axis probability so the blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

382
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:02,060
are mainly simula except for the values

about three hour or two hours and

385
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:11,379
there's a curve with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the timeout value</font>

386
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:14,360
of one hour so much more effect and

387
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:17,660
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are due to world slap dampening of</font>

388
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,479
course which you can't see in visit 15

389

minutes timeout value but which you get

390
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:28,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">with one hour time out so about how many</font>

394
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:41,900
again logarithmically scales so the blue

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,060
can see most of the births contain only

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:05,420
a few updates up to 10 at sunburst can

provides statistical information and

408
