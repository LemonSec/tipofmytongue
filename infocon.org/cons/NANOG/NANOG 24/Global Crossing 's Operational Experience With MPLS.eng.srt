tended to connect at the edge of the

372
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,890
is enable packet forwarding into the

373
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,780

with a bunch of 26 hundreds and whatnot

401
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:35,210
in the first quarter in 1999 we really

402
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">started to do production trials in the</font>

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,360
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarter we officially announced</font>

between all of our core routers and in

409

second quarter of two thousand when we

410
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,570
really more as a result of actually

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,410
becoming a global company we extended

414
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,690
that mesh to include the whole globe so

415
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,720
you could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do a traceroute from</font>

and then second quarter of last year as

what this really had the effect of doing

431
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,650
is resetting the forwarding table so

that operations groups need a lot of

469

rolled out MPLS based VPNs was our

472
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,850
operations group already had two full

473
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,800
years of experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> with mpls from the</font>

474
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,610
core perspective before they had to dive

475
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,740
in and deal with VPNs it was also

476
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,179
interesting that while our core knock

477
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,010
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then are currently in the process of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">cross-training some of the ATM guys to</font>

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:04,000
do IP VIP guys to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATM that we hear</font>

480
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,750
remarks such as oh this ATM stuff is a

481
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,650
lot like mpls and<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh mpls is kind of</font>

482
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:15,640
like an ATM light there are a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

483
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:18,250
conceptual similarities that obviously

484
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,160
stops about it the conceptual level but

485
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,500
clearly the operations hassle of

486
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,780
training everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with mpls</font>

487
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,550
really isn't as impossible as expensive

488
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,550
as some people thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be</font>

489
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:38,559
couple of the notes on our Express route

490
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,149
architecture this is our IP VPN product

491
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,770
one of the objectives was to provide as

492
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,720
much isolation from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet as</font>

493
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,629
possible while still leveraging the

494
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,100
bandwidth in our core so we chose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

495
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,370
a separate autonomous system number

496
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,740
that's not advertised the private

497
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,260
routers are not reachable from outside

498
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,930
of our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> space is</font>

499
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:03,620
not advertised there's a full mesh of

500
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:06,260
LSPs between all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PRS and there's</font>

501
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,969
also a full ibgp mesh along among all

502
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,460
the PRS we're not don't have a

503
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:15,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirement to use route reflectors at</font>

504
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:20,390
this point with only 25 private routers

505
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:23,629
out there across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the globe in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

506
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:26,950
lab testing we baked off cisco and

507
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:29,380
juniper and we ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up selecting</font>

508
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,780
juniper routers for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a private router</font>

509
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:35,000
based in part upon their VPN road<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac</font>

510
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:38,600
and some capabilities they had such as

511
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,090
the ccc capability and the l2vpn<font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap</font>

512
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,090
but we also found in the lab did testing

513
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">from an RFC 2547 standpoint and keep in</font>

514
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:48,290
mind this was quite some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago maybe</font>

515
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">a year as much as a year and a half ago</font>

516
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,178
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juniper proved to be much more</font>

517
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,620
scalable in terms of number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ers and</font>

518
00:22:53,179 --> 00:23:00,920
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes and those be arrested</font>

519
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:05,570
it could support<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 47 I like the</font>

520
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:08,450
orders of magnitude more ers sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco</font>

521
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:10,820
solve that by now a secondary objective

522
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,170
is to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> high a class of service as</font>

523
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,350
possible so there's a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

524
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do here the LSPs themselves that</font>

525
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,740
start at the private routers have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

526
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,630
higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority than LSPs for the</font>

527
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:24,200
internet service so they always get the

528
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,700
best path through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and also</font>

529
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,190
we paint all the toss bits into a

530
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">business class which has been rewritten</font>

533
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,530
customers have

provisioning has got more on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font>

556
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,020
of 800 circuits and<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly a market</font>

557
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,299
interest is still gaining some momentum

558
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,679
for this product set and particularly

559
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:53,220
enterprise customers I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they</font>

560
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,840
really understand what an IP VPN can

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,270
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them or why they'd wanna</font>

564
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,480

to a year before you can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> close</font>

standpoint they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> both extremely</font>

571
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:27,899
complex and<font color="#CCCCCC"> verbose and their</font>

572
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,480
configurations and there's simply no way

573
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,650
to do it without having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a automated tool</font>

574
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,590
to generate those configurations

575
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:37,710
snippets for you now which we do have

576
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,090
it's called sniper<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that somebody</font>

577
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,640
was thinking of shooting someone at the

578
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:44,000
time they wrote it

579
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,880
I couldn't save<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but this diaper</font>

580
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,150
basically allows you to take a customer

581
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,440
design and map it into all the points

582
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,810
they want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network and then</font>

583
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,780
generates all your configs that you can

584
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:58,850
then push out to the routers some of the

585
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,070
differences in just the way that our

586
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:04,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">provisioning group prefers to do things</font>

587
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:07,220
the l2vpn<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really easy from a setup</font>

588
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,710
standpoint customer says I want l2vpn we

589
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,630
say where we configure it it's it's

590
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward or customer can</font>

591
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,630
push whatever they want over that LSU

592
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,460
VPN and it just doesn't bug us at all

593
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,380
but the difficulty there is that if

594
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,870
after the provisioning is complete they

595
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,390
want to add another another circuit into

596
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,919
the VPN you not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only have to update that</font>

597
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">one circuit but you have to go and</font>

598
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,870
update every other interface as part of

599
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,540
that VPN such as adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adele</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sea or</font>

600
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:38,840
whatever the cross connects into the LSP

601
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:41,570
that goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other routers and this</font>

602
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,830
can be a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a hassle the l3 view</font>

603
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:47,000
pans on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hand is a little more</font>

604
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:50,120
automated you bring attach the customers

<font color="#E5E5E5">and distributes the VPN information but</font>

608
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:00,320
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know one of the issues that we</font>

609
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,540
see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that l3 VPNs because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a nice</font>

610
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,139
view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much more involved role and</font>

611
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the routing for the customer you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

612
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,860
have some knowledge about the way their

613
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,230
existing network is built and exactly

614
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:16,580
what they hope to get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the</font>

615
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:18,700
service so what we've seen is we have a

616
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,960
lot of these customers coming in and

617
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:26,750
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to bet the farm on IP</font>

618
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,010
VPN or MPLS based VPNs that rather

619
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,930
they'd like to use it as a backup

620
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,480
solution for their existing frame relay

621
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:36,140
Network which they obviously are quite

622
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,610
comfortable with but this customer could

623
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">be running a whole bunch of stuff it</font>

624
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,780
could be running eigrp<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example and</font>

625
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might not something might not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

626
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,379
something you

627
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:48,749
to run in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> vrf onion juniper so you</font>

628
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:50,998
would encourage them to maybe upgrade

629
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:53,579
the ospf and and we've helped customers

630
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:55,559
to transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a better network</font>

631
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:59,879
topology that's going to work a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

632
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:01,259
more cleanly with the VPN so this sort

633
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:03,958
of situation really highlights the

634
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:05,849
importance for the customer network

635
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:08,969
engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:10,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">both pre and post-sales in this</font>

637
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:12,929
particular case we help them help them

638
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:14,399
redesign and probably are looking at a

639
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:18,599
lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these types of</font>

640
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,738
customers now once the customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is up</font>

641
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,928
and running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and he</font>

642
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:24,389

00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:25,409
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finds out that it rocks they tend</font>

644
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:26,849
to leave it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they make the</font>

645
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:33,209
frame relay met with the backup so

646
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:36,629
that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing when we decided to</font>

647
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:39,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">deploy some limited ipv6 capability to</font>

649
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,708
of an unofficial product we rolled out a

650
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:46,679
few routers to some of the native

651
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:48,599
exchange points and like everybody else

652
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:51,209
sure we could have just done GRE tunnels

653
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:53,399
but hey we got mpls so so we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

654
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:55,559
and some of the cool stuff this does is

655
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">kurt tunnel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> utilization statistics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

656

659

network you know and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

660
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,549
scalable in a sense not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

661
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:11,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">having the overlaying being able to add</font>

662
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:13,109
routers into the mesh very easily but I

663
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:14,428
can be pretty confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

664
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:22,500
gonna affect anything else on the

665
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:25,330
network so

666
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,030
basic question we had the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

667
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,379
we had today but we were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

668
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:34,000
forwarding when we still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

669
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:36,039
leap to mpls well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> modeling is</font>

670
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,470
indicated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't need mpls for</font>

671
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:40,870
traffic engineering right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but the</font>

672
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,710
architectural benefits of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> it 100%</font>

mpls traffic engineer network are

674
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:49,630
valuable for MPLS based<font color="#CCCCCC"> bpms from the</font>

675
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,370
reverse point of view we own perceived

676
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,260
it there to be any value i'm going back

677
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,799
to simply doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a of IP forwarding</font>

678
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,150
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> between being able to give VPN</font>

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,659
lowest latency prioritize traffic for

681
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,549
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowest latency and guaranteed</font>

682
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:05,169

683
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:06,639
of traffic takes or simply wouldn't be

684
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:10,120
any sense in revamping the network

685
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,340
without mpls so to summarize we like it

686
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,280
we've been using it for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

690
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:27,450
it's always usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> disclaimer your own</font>

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,450
mileage I might library

00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:39,739
what's that

694
00:30:47,810 --> 00:31:01,970
I think there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions hey thank</font>

not been a one-man team effort it's been
