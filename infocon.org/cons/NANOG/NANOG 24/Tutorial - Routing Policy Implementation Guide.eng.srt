00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,758
okay well everyone welcome to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miami</font>

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,309
welcome to nine out of 24 in the routing

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,429
policy tutorial my name is Dan Goldin I

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,379
work for Sakai networks were a routing

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,059
optimization company up in the Boston

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,560
area basically what we're going to be

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,130
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today is routing policy</font>

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,140
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is who's the audience</font>

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this sort of presentation the</font>

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,160
audience is network engineers with a

11
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,769
basic knowledge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP an internetwork</font>

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,800
routing if you're you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of</font>

13
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,300
incredibly knowledgeable bgp guru this

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,510
presentation may be of limited used to

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,430
you luckily there's few of those people

16
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,070
if you don't know anything about

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,200
networking and you're like ospf<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh then</font>

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,950
this presentation may also be of

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,840
somewhat limited utility to this

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,100
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really for people who</font>

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,020
have a good basic knowledge of IP

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,699
routing a good basic knowledge of inter

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,340
domain routing and want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

24
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,690
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write policy from it take</font>

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,730
that in right documents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,280
policies for their networks or for the

27
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,470
networks they serve so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,450
why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you here to learn and discuss</font>

29
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,460
network and routing policy and to help

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,310
your networks expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> into new horizons</font>

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,479
and by expanding to new horizons I mean

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,130
let's say you have a network and it

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,810
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a service provider network it</font>

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,070
could be an enterprise network it could

35
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,960
be an enterprise network becoming a

36
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,279
service provider network it could be any

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things and you want to do stuff</font>

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,180
like offer transit to your customers you

39
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,280
want to do stuff like<font color="#CCCCCC"> start peering</font>

40
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,229
which is these days becoming more and

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,689
more common you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know even among large</font>

42
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,210
enterprise networks in order to do these

43
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really really need a decent</font>

44
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,250
routing policy a well-documented routing

45
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,380
policy now the questions are why are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

46
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">here the reasons why you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not here</font>

47
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,890
you're not here to learn where the route

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,020
map is because route maps aren't really

49
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,880
routing policy simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things right here</font>

50
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route maps and policy</font>

51
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,539
statements aren't routing policy there

52
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,070
how you do routing policy so we're not

53
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do any like Cisco or</font>

juniper syntax although you may see a

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,390
little bit kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of floating throughout</font>

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,340
the the PowerPoint here and you're not

57
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,619
here necessary to learn bgp or the

58
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,960
routing protocols a lot of what we're

59
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,788
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there were multiple exterior</font>

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">gateway protocols would probably be</font>

61
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,269
protocol independent but since we only

00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">have one since we only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bgp it is</font>

vgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> dependent but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an accession</font>

64
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,140
to really help you learn bgp there's

65
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:24,070
some really excellent presentations and

comment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know please shout it out</font>

please say something please stand up if

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,130
you want to you can come up to the mic

72
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,960
and talk if you don't to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the</font>

73
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,359
mic you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just shout it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

74
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,010
big room I'll repeat the question back

75
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,960
to you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then either answer it or</font>

76
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:51,700
solicit someone in the crowd for an

77
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:52,840
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi so also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's just</font>

78
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,579
start out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is what is</font>

79
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,250
routing policy as we said before it is

80
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,310
in route maps it is an appearing policy

81
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,950
it isn't a film for policy like a prefix

82
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,500
filtering policy and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't a set of</font>

83
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,119
standard router configurations<font color="#E5E5E5"> but these</font>

84
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">can all be aspects of a good routing</font>

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,440
policy these are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font>

86
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put together and collect and</font>

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,790
once you have them all together there

88
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,440
are aspects of a routing policy but what

89
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,900
a routing policy really is is it is

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,940
single overarching document<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

91
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,580
encompasses all of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that</font>

92
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:28,780
has pointers to all of these things so

93
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,540
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with a definition of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font>

94
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,100
a routing policy now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect this</font>

95
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be sort of a canonical definition of</font>

96
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,209
a routing policy because if you has ten

97
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,859
different network engineers you know he

98
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,590
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a routing policy you're probably</font>

99
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,810
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get 10 different answers so</font>

100
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a good approximation of</font>

101
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,500
it from looking at a lot of other

102
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,690
people's routing policies and saying

103
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,940
okay if I take sort of the union<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

104
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,120
big set of routing policies what do I

105
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">get out of it and what basically I saw</font>

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,360
through all these different routing

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,340
policies both companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've worked at</font>

108
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably most of the major providers</font>

109
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,750
is its expression of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a networks goals so</font>

110
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,250
in other words it's not necessarily what

111
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,690
you're doing today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not</font>

112
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,910
necessarily maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

113
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,440
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow but it's it's usually</font>

114
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,120
what you hope to be doing eventually

115
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,859
when you get all your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff together and</font>

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you manage to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get caught up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

117
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,830
maintenance and you managed to get all

118
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,720
this stuff deployed but you really want

119
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:21,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get deployed so it's the expression</font>

120
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,110
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a networks goals for a selection of</font>

121
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,300
routes they you except from your peers

122
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,879
your customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

123
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're upstream providers its expression</font>

124
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,770
of goals for selection and modification

125
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,229
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes you're sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

126
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,359
peers customers and upstream providers

127
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,849
and it's a methodology of identifying

128
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,610
routes within your own autonomous system

129
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,139
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it's a routing policy it's</font>

130
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,849
all about routes and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

131
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,650
to where the rouse you send the route

132
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,900
you receive and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes within your</font>

133
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,549
autonomous system<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's about classifying</font>

134
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,090
them about measuring them about

135
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:57,129
identifying now why is a strong routing

136
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,508
policy necessary and again by strong

137
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:01,389
routing policy we mean some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

138
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">written document specifying what your</font>

139
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,159
networks routing policy is amazing there

140
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,050
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm sure there still are</font>

141
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:10,030
many large networks out there with

142
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,009
absolutely no routing policy and writing

143
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,138
at all they have some collections some

144
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:16,210
disjointed collection of documents that

145
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,250
appearing policy over here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

147
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,909
they have a filter policy and they have

148
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,799
a set of standard router configs and

149
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:25,659
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe they don't but maybe rancid</font>

gets all their configs every night you

151
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,629
know there are plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks like that</font>

152
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:30,639
out there but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> good reasons</font>

153
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,949
especially if you're starting kind of

154
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,819
fresh to have a strong routing policy

155
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:39,190
the first region<font color="#E5E5E5"> is scalability it's</font>

156
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:41,380
very easy to have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer and it's very</font>

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,960
easy to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten customers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you had</font>

158
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,479

159
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,279
customers doing things without a strong

160
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,870
routing policy get you into trouble

161
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,650
because everything becomes a custom

162
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,330
operation so scalability being able to

163
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,599
scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> to large</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers appears in</font>

important especially you know not if you

168
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,930
have you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> one data center somewhere</font>

171
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,190
know where the routes are entering your

a big part of routing policy especially

189
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,849
as it applies to bgp at the use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

190
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,640

standards with strong community strings

193
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,730
and these are a huge plus for clue full

240
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,860
unreasonable to expect an upstream to

pretty pretty large elements of the

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,020
disclosure and a new point in keeping

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,849
this stuff secret you know everybody

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
keeping the stuff secret you're not

298
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,750
really doing anything but but sort of

299
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,930
being clannish so to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into</font>

300
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,430
some of the elements of a routing policy

customer routes inbound<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an</font>

302
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,609
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this won't apply to everyone</font>

303

but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start providing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">start providing transit to people and</font>

this isn't necessarily i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling a ds3</font>

307
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,020
today this could be we purchased a

company<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we have to provide transit</font>

309

to them or internet access or whatever

310
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,180
they call it they may not call it

311
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,950
transit this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation where you</font>

312
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,109
may have some kind of a partnership but

313
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">in any case you want to take people and</font>

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,800
give them all the routes you've got and

315
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,210
you want to take certain routes from

316
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,890
them and you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of careful</font>

318
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,860
these people well because there's

they're either part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company or</font>

320
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,680
there's somebody's paying you money for

321
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,810
transit there's some kind of

322
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,949
relationship there you want to preserve

323
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,170
there is a couple of important points

324
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,290
here when you're accepting routes from a

325
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,849
customer or pseudo customer now the

326
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,790
first question<font color="#CCCCCC"> four routes do you accept</font>

327
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,770
you know do filter by prefix do you say

328
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay customer is there a list of</font>

329
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,000
prefixes that you have to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and</font>

330
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,069
I'm only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept those or do you</font>

331
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,800
just filter by autonomous system do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

332
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,650
say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything with autonomous system</font>

333
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,599
X and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s path i'm going to accept</font>

334
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,790
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> pathless are definitely easier but</font>

335
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,120
they're certainly not recommended it's

336
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,099
somewhat of a dangerous situation prefix

337
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,180
filtering is highly recommended there's

338
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,300
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more administrative overhead</font>

339
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,310
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more cumbersome but the</font>

340
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,920
end result is a downstream customer of

341
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,660
yours is not going to easily be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

342
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,380
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a full Internet routing table</font>

343
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,310
and turn themselves into a transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

downstream customers returning today s

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,660
is bad who you know bad stuff we don't

<font color="#E5E5E5">to go there and there's a couple other</font>

347
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,650
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> as will go on to keep that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

348
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,110
happening don't only rely on prefix

349
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">lists because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how many people</font>

350
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,790
touch a customer's prefix lista de how

351
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,920
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it to leave a statement off the</font>

352
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,300
end of that prefix list and this happens

353
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,490
every couple months to one provider or

354
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,609
another and they turn a customer into a

355
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:38,010
transit a s you know bad mojo maximum

356
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,480
pretty sick sighs what's the maximum

357
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,280
prefixes you're going to accept from a

358
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,110
customer now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very politically</font>

will send at their peering points will

send / 24 s on to other providers now

reasons sometimes to accept smaller

essentially to route without having

<font color="#E5E5E5">and the old days when when people could</font>

be multihomed but not have a / 24

387

<font color="#E5E5E5">just look at someone will accept just</font>

you're writing your customer facing<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp</font>

you decide to accept accept but make

399
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,670
sure the customer knows that other

400
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,770
people aren't obliged to listen to those

401
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,540
announcements that just because you're

accepting them just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I change my</font>

things go very hairy very quickly and

accepting smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements another</font>

great<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do for your customer</font>

412

screwed up a prefix list and you're

accepting too many prefixes from a

00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,730
customer would have to screw up we'd

436
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,950
have to screw up well they will

437
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,510
eventually and the way of a big internet

438
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,060

441
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,579
this is simply another thing you can do

to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that won't happen and it</font>

443
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,100
takes a little more intelligence it

444
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,019
takes a little better training

willing to register customers routes for

just shoot these out there one thing is

<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to make it easy so you have to</font>

have tools written tools ready tools on

525
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,449
the web page you can't necessarily

526
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,280
expect a customer to have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

template and send an email template<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to register their routes customers do</font>

529
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,350
not know how to register their routes

530
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,270
that's key hopefully one thing will move

531
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,280
to you know a little closer to in the

532
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,730
future is having a situation like ripe

00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the case here with Aaron hopefully</font>

537
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,870
we can move towards that but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

538
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,340
there's there's still other problems you

539
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,169
know a smaller blocks of address space

540
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,270
and I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way to solve that</font>

541
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:35,570
is going to be more tools and easier

542
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,490
tools for customers you have to have

543
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,439
some integrated way possibly through a

544
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,930
web tool of saying you know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me all</font>

the routes you want to advertise and

546
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,330
maybe at the same time you generate your

547
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,950
filters you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can register the routes for</font>

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,190
registrations my only advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

581
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:16,680
automated as much as you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

582
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,820
going on to customer routes basically

583
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,070
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have your highest local</font>

584
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,350
preference again you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in</font>

585
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,240
a situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone is sending you</font>

586
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,850
a bunch of free pens so you're sending

587
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,110
rats for a customer is paying you

588
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,490
towards appear is not paying you and

589
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,990
there's a couple reasons for that for

590
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,880
one thing you've got assume that you're

591
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,590
the highest quality transit and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

592
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customer for anything on your</font>

593
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,620
network should be getting the traffic

594
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,389
directly from you since they're paying

595
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,070
you since that's sort of a contractual

596
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,140
arrangement the other thing that's

597
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">important there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you know 95th</font>

598
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,320
percentile billing you want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid</font>

599
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,379
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to send the customer</font>

600
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,750
any traffic you can and finally you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

601
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,750
the other issue there is

602
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,178
move up anyways<font color="#E5E5E5"> mids are also usually</font>

603
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,740
listen to for customers the application

604
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,419
there's customers who have either

605
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,240
multiple transits with you on one side

606
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:09,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">or multiple sites where they have</font>

607
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,499
transits with you so meds are almost

608
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,539
always listened to for customer traffic

609
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:15,950
inbound meds<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very infrequently used</font>

610
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:18,240
but they're almost always listened to

611
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,289
with customer routes and with all the

612
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,090
other kinds of rats we're going to talk

613
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,529
about it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set unique</font>

614
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,759
communities and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this a</font>

615
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,190
little bit later in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our discussion of</font>

616
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,470
communities but it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font>

617
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,509
route map or policy statement to set the

618
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,610
appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unique communities for</font>

619
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:35,009
each type of routes on route ingress

620
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,779
once rats get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network it's</font>

621
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:38,460
essentially impossible to set any kind

622
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,600
of policy on them so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

623
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,610
able to control<font color="#CCCCCC"> them when they leave</font>

624
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,559
your network or control them appears

625
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,418
control them a customer's control them

626
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,190
at any point inside your network make

627
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,080
sure you mark them with the community as

628
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,460
they enter your network now let's

629
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,740
briefly talk about customer routes

630
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,419
outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my customer outs outbound I</font>

631
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,249
mean the routes were sending to

632
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:58,289
customers the routes were sending to

633
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,879
transit customers rather than the routes

634
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,950
from customers that were sending out to

635
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,928
peers now you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

636
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,240

637
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:09,059
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> full routes partial routes or</font>

638
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,129
default route only you know back in the

639
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">old days when when people had 20 50 ones</font>

00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:15,689
with 16 megs memory and did this you

driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable that at the time was maybe</font>

40,000 routes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure these people</font>

643
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">here who remember when there are a few</font>

644
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,340
arrests than 40,000 they had routers

645
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,649
that just could not accept the number of

646
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,299
routes they're being sent so then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

647
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:30,379
very typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just send a default</font>

648
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:32,970
route or just impartial rounds now

649
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:34,799
partial routes are essentially if I'm

650
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,570
the transit provider and you're the

651
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,129
customer if I'm sending you partial

652
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,619
routes I'm sending you all the routes

653
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:42,330
for my internal network I'm sending you

654
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,399
all the routes for any statically routed

655
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,529
customers I have and I'm sending you all

656
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:48,508
the routes for any BGP customers I have

657
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:50,220
but I'm not sending you any of my peers

658
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:52,200
routes I'm not sending you any of my

659
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,490
transit providers routes and when you

660
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,889
answer partial routes the number of

661
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,259
routes you get is very much dependent on

662
00:23:55,889 --> 00:24:00,990
who the provider is you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk be</font>

663
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,929
talking as it was 500 you could be

664
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:06,000
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 20 or 30,000 or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font>

665
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:07,530
world comes up to these days so greatly

666
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,450
depends on who

667
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,830
talking to and these days its kind of

668
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,990
happening again there's a lot of routers

669
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:17,310
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now have 60 for megs of</font>

670
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:20,250
memory you know the prodigals<font color="#CCCCCC"> 36-40 with</font>

672
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,090
no longer take 104,000 routes so we're

673
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,030
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit this again in a few</font>

674
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,610
places but of course always the best

<font color="#E5E5E5">to offer these three choices some</font>

680
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,930
transit providers actually offer more

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,270
choices they offer whether to aggregate

682
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:45,660

without summary aggregates many possibly

686
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,510
most providers don't actually aggregate

687
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,930
towards their customers for obvious

688
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,190
reasons some<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers again do allow</font>

689
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,040
you to choose a certain amount of

690
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,140
aggregation remember that by providing

691
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,120
customers with rich communities they can

692
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,960
do their own filtering leave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good example of this is it and you</font>

say okay i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can give you partial routes</font>

697
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,469
or i can give you full routes and i can

698
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,940
tell you what my community strings are

and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that you can do the</font>

700

advantage to you because then you can do

706
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,199
it on the fly you don't have to call me

time necessarily dealing with a customer

713
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,810
so it's a win-win for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

715
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,100
using communities on their own side the

716
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,080
problems there are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're kind of</font>

717
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,520
locked into what communities you use you

718
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,020
can't go changing communities right on

719
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,240
your customers then or<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you're going</font>

720
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:07,379
to crash their routers which is not cool

721
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,550
at all and in addition you have to have

722
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,230
customers with a certain degree of

723
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,560
engineering clue they have to know how

724
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:16,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up community-based filterless and</font>

725
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,820

talking about peering and transit routes

of course customer routes are always at

the top generally as you move down you

823
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,490
get into private peering public hearing

and then transit now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course pier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

825
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,090

that private peering is very the public

<font color="#CCCCCC">in even more there may be economic</font>

883

the local press for these based on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,159
kind of strange maybe something's really

prepended something that's obviously not

892
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,200

array of local preference based on both

and you can certainly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

extend this to transit as well there's

paraphrase the<font color="#CCCCCC"> late jon postel so you're</font>

usually going to fill when you're

938
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,759
sitting around outbound you're usually

939
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,190
going to filter on the / 24 boundary you

940

know or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more conservative / 24</font>

941
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,809
is the least conservative thing you want

<font color="#E5E5E5">to filter on meds are usually sent and</font>

their way to zero out meds before they

00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,619
send them but they're really listened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

part of your bilateral peering agreement

00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:19,379
unless there's some kind of technical

understanding on behalf of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers</font>

engineering team and your engineering

951
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,049
team and aggregates are normally

952
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,089
announced for your own blocks in other

953
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:29,969
words if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big provider with a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">slash eight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you have some / 16 and</font>

955
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:33,928
your you slice those up into tiny little

956
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,450
parts that are static routes for all

957
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,429
your customers you're almost always

958
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,629
going to send an aggregate out because

959
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,339
you could have some pretty small slices

960
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:42,480
there now the big question is are you

961
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:44,849
going to announce that aggregate is a

962
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,829
summary in other words if you have a / 8

963
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:49,530
are you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to announce the / aid</font>

964
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:53,460
or you can announce a / 24 and larger

965
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:55,950
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the / 8 and suppress the 25 to 30</font>

966
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,839
tues that's kind of up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you guys and</font>

967
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:00,240
it definitely cuts down on routing table

968
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,670
size when you suppress everything but

969
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,160
the /a<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is you're suppressing</font>

970
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,200
routing information as well people who

971
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,520
have space inside there may be trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

972
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,290
do stuff like send free pens

973
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,060
out essentially you're throwing that

974
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,020
routing information on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor you</font>

975
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,420
know that's kind of the point of the

976
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,130
atomic aggregator bit and in aggregate

977
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,990
you're saying you're you're losing some

978
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,100
routing information well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

979
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,990
the routing information you can be

980
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,000
losing and your your customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

981
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,490
hopefully paying you may or may not like

982
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,700
that so my personal opinion is that you

983
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:32,640
should send at least / 24 s and larger

984
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,990
blocks of IP addresses out even if

985
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,940
you're aggregating and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font>

986
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,609
your peers if you're pure say oh boy

987
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,860
they're sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that / 8 and then 800</font>

988
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,050
prefixes inside that if they don't to

989
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,400
listen to those 800 prefixes that's

990
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,580
their call they you know you've done

991
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">right by your customers and it for peers</font>

992
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,210
and supposed to transit providers the

993
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,100
big difference is usually only customer

994
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,530
and internal routes or announced in

995
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,650
other words let's say you're Mike here

996
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,820
and I'm your pure rather than sending

1087
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,470
how are you going to split things up to

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,419
be equitable and a lot of that greatly

1089
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,189
depends on the size of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so</font>

1090
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,960
those criteria are all important things

should have for the last thing you want

<font color="#E5E5E5">is some Yahoo who may be pointed a</font>

1118
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,169
need is a bilateral peering agreement a

1119

bilateral peering ring is a contract

with you now most of these BL pas are

00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,700
pretty weak and that they have things

1123
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">like 30 date cancellation policies but</font>

1132
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:39,820
unicam by now mostly conspirators have

1133
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,900
moved from ISP to ISP taking either one

1134
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,609
taking their bilateral hearing

1135
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,500
agreements with them and crossing out

1136
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,848
the names or they get other people's

1137
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,560
bilateral peering agreements and cross

1138
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:49,270
out the names every once in a while

1139
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,950
you'll get a bilateral appearing

1140
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,570
agreement from someone and you'll really

1141
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,700
look through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it carefully and you'll see</font>

1142
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,020
another providers name or another pure

1143

be a customer of yours and now who maybe

would have acquired you eventually but

1196
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:50,019
it also can lead to decrease customer

1198
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:53,740
routing policy there's the question of

1199
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:54,910
customer requirements in other words an

1200
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,220
essential part of your routing policy

1201
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:59,710
are what are the requirements on your

1202
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,419
customers usually these are the

1203
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,339
requirements for bringing up a BGP

1204
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,019
session with you because until the

1205
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:06,819
customer brings up a BGP session with

1206
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:09,160
you they're part of your routing domain

1207
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:11,440
for all intents and purposes things are

1208
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,609
like iOS and juice versions in other

1209
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,490
words are you going to bring up the GP

1210
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:17,799
peering with someone running iOS you

1211
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,649
know 10.1 just to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> something out of</font>

1214

have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of minimum requirement</font>

1215
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,480
there md5 authentication again you're

00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to require your customers to have</font>

md5 of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an occasion and the bigger</font>

1218
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,700
question is are you going to support

00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:35,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to defy the authentication when</font>

1220

someone let's say a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> angel</font>

turned up requirements for customer side

1223
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,519
filters most isp's require customers to

1224
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,349
have filters in place of course you

1225
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,970
can't assure this you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for</font>

00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:50,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your customers the filters in</font>

1240
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,099
advertise 10 / 8 which of course you

1241
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,740
never would and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to announce</font>

doing that not exactly sure what they

1246
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:37,740
are but that's that's a more uncommon

1247
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:39,660
requirement finally authentication of

1248
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,700
net block ownership this has become a

1249
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,529
much larger issue recently in other

1250
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,790
words you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old days and then</font>

1251
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,740
of course this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet so the</font>

1252
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,690
old days is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and the</font>

1253
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,609
old days if someone said I own block x

1254
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,800
i'm going to start announcing it to you

1255
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:54,210
now you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know start</font>

1256
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,030
announcing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll change my filters</font>

1257
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:59,220
these days you know things aren't quite

1258
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,290
so trusting and the ownership of net

1259
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,549
locks is not quite so obvious there's

1260
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,040
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of mergers there been a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1261
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:07,290
of acquisitions there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of we</font>

1262
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,270
see that projector there that projector

1263
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:12,089
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slushy with it and I'm selling it</font>

1265
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:15,810
/a there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot of that going on</font>

1266
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">so there there have been a lot of</font>

efforts to authenticate<font color="#E5E5E5"> net block</font>

1268
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,040
ownership you know that some of that's

1269
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">been done to hire our records of course</font>

1270
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,290
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> our records are not famously accurate</font>

1271
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,629
some of that's done through air and ripe

1272
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:33,599
and ethnic who is which I think tends to

1273
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,820
be a little more accurate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay community</font>

1274
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,460
specifications communities<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the heart</font>

1275
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,560
of a routing policy communities allow

1276
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,770
you to classify routes again why

1277
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:48,390
classification filtering diagnosis and

1278
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:49,920
being able to change attributes let me

1279
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:52,049
give a brief analogy you know there's a

1280
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,300
vast sea of routes over a hundred

1281
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,280
thousand rounds communities when you

1282
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,080
call some routes tuna and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

1283
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,300
salmon instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just calling all</font>

1284
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,730
routes fish you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it lets you</font>

1285
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,880
classify and split routes up into more

1286
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:08,430
easily definable sets now communities

1287
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,390
are not groups or sets of rounds the

1288
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,460
best way to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1289
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:15,990
community is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a sticky note a</font>

1290
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:20,160
post-it note a community is a label or

with communities you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why should i</font>

1356
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,240
go to all this trouble communities are a

1357
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,250
lot of work you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I have to change my</font>

router can say exacta to write up this

1360
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:03,299
the reason is again it's easy to send

1361
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">all routes or it's easy to send five</font>

sending 10,000 rounds that's a tough

1365
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:15,090
issue it's tough to enumerate all those

it's tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a new is easy to enumerate</font>

1368
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:21,840
appear it's hard to enumerate 100 a SS

1369
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,220
and have that list of hundred a esas be

the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all your pure in routers</font>

1371
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,120
that's where communities come in again

1372
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,380
community where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you classify and tagged</font>

allowing easier filtering of those

1375
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,490
routes upon egress of your network don't

1376

be the network operator who has to touch

will be 65,000 colon 150 it's a very

1436
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:58,450
nice easy way of remembering these

1437
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:59,980
things and the thing to remember here is

1438
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,960
when you're troubleshooting you want

1439
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,880
something easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember some folks</font>

one thing the second digit means

00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,740
something also third digit means another

1455
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,170
selective prepending this is a really

1456
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,810
neat cool feature what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allows you</font>

1457
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:39,640
to do it allows your customers your

1458
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:41,230
customer can always prepend routes to

1459
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,900
you right they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always add additional</font>

1460
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:46,030
autonomous systems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the AAS path they</font>

00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:48,070
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you all day long but</font>

1462
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:50,020
be cool that they could only if they

1463
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:51,880
could prepend selectively in other words

1464
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,350
if you have let's say your simple

1465
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,910
network with three transit providers

1466
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:57,250
wouldn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great if they could only</font>

1467
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:59,920
send free pens to one of your up streams

1468
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:02,410
let's say get 50 peers let's say they

1469
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,170
only wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send prepend 25 of your</font>

1470
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:06,339
50 peers this sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like something that</font>

1471
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:08,080
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be incredibly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to</font>

1472
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,030
implement but it's actually pretty nice

1473
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,740
and straight forward but there's some

1474
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:14,620
and what this allows your customers to

1475
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:18,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it is to green gain finer control of</font>

1476
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:20,380
their incoming traffic and you have to

1477
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:23,069
decide who you want this enable towards

1478
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:25,240
in other words if you have 200 peers

1479
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,860
that can lead to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of long</font>

1480
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,839

1481
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:30,610
this towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> every one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your peers you</font>

1482
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,530
can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I just want to enable this</font>

1483
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:34,480
towards transit providers I just want to

1484
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">enable this towards peers I just want to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">enable this towards my largest peers</font>

1486
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:41,169
that's a good decision to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make before</font>

you get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and of course the most</font>

1488
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:44,860
important thing here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so then the</font>

1490
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,550
you're going to publish this and to make

1491
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,440
this worthwhile you have to publish your

1492
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,790
communities to your customers you're

1493
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,740
going to be documenting who you're

1494
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:56,620
peering with now for most people this

1495
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:58,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't a big deal but for some people for</font>

1496
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:01,960
whom appearing as a dark deep secret

1497
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:04,390
this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of prohibited an</font>

1498
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:08,110
example here of how to do this is let's

1499
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:12,490
say you're a SS 1 2 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could have a</font>

1500
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:14,170
community 1 2 3 4 colon 4701 and what

1501
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:16,240
this would mean is that one of your your

1502
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,890
customers could send you this community

1503
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,770
and what would happen is that you would

1504
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:24,310
prepend their route announcements only

1505
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:26,230
towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 14 times and of course it</font>

1506
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:29,020
would probably be<font color="#E5E5E5"> your a s being</font>

00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:30,940
prepended<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto it there's usually a</font>

00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:32,770
maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of free pens usually</font>

1509
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,440
something like five or six sometimes

1510
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,670
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or two the more pre pens you</font>

1511
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,560
want your customers to be able to add

1512
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:41,170
the longer and more complex your router

1513
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:43,240
configs are going to be this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is normally</font>

1514
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:44,770

1516
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:49,900

whatever

1519
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,550
so here's basically a quick chart of how

1520
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,050
to do this and we'll skip over this

1521
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,730
pretty quickly because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">see an actual configuration example of</font>

1523
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,480
how to do this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but essentially</font>

1524
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,509
what you're doing is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1525
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:10,670
deny<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martians deny exchange routes you</font>

1526
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:13,430
know match community customer routes and

1527
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,630
then you're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

1528
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:18,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's going to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community</font>

1529
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:19,820
called prepend this provider by one so

1530
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,800
then I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prepend by one and the</font>

1531
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,150
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you have a separate term for</font>

1532
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,900
however many pre pens you want to be

1533
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:28,280
able to do to each particular peer no

1534
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,140
peer this is again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proposed</font>

1535
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known community but the many people</font>

1536
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:35,480
have implemented with their own

1537
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:38,600
communities<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay again no peer no</font>

1538
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,610
Pierre is kind of a variant of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AS</font>

1539
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,310
prepending but what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

1540
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:46,240
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actually no peer is</font>

1541
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:49,430
essentially saying I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to send</font>

1542
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:51,350
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting rods for my customer and I</font>

1543
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,700
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send them to my customers and I</font>

1544
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:54,259
want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be floating around in my</font>

1545
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,759
internal network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to</font>

1546
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,080
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to any my transit providers</font>

1547
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,270
and I don't want to send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any of</font>

1548
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,100
my peers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font>

1549
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:04,790
for one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers to kind of</font>

1550
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,690
simulate peering with you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of</font>

1551
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,860
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually going to be</font>

1552
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your period routers and of course</font>

1553
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,460
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be paying for transit</font>

1554
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:13,160
but it's still a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of pretend</font>

1555
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:16,330
to be appear and there's there's good

1556
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,620
and bad reasons for doing this and

1557
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:20,690
here's an example for Matt you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1558
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:24,380
two three four six six six this is not

1559
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:27,110
an uncommon community so selective

1560
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:29,360
suppression this is sort of a variant of

1561
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:32,540
selective prepending but selector

1562
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,280
suppression says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say again on</font>

1563
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:38,600
the transit provider and I have 50 peers

1564
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:40,610
and you're my downstream customer your

1565
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,920
use the downturn customer may say I want

1566
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send routing announcements to 40 of</font>

1567
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,520
your 50 peers but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't ascend writing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">announcements to 10 of those peers</font>

1569
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,180
something like selective suppression

1570
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:52,069
would let you drop those routing

1571
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">announcements towards some of your peers</font>

1572
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,610

1573
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,530
and again this is another way for

1574
00:56:55,610 --> 00:57:00,500
customers to gain finer grained control

1575
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:03,840
of incoming traffic an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of this</font>

1580
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:20,100
701 again here's sort of a block diagram

1581
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:22,290
of how to be selective suppression and

1582
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:26,130
typically what's happening here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is he</font>

1583
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:28,050
will do no peer first if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're no</font>

1584
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:29,880

1585
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,530
look to say no peer and no peer will be

1586
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,200
in common<font color="#E5E5E5"> between all of your routing</font>

1587
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:36,210
policies and you'll move on to do your

1588
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,069
selective prepending and here there's

1589
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,570
just an example of prepend one and of

1590
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,810
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have as many pre pens as you</font>

1591
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:45,180
want and moving down a little farther

1592
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:47,340
there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Selective suppression match</font>

1593
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:51,569
community suppress and then you deny the

00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:52,800
route<font color="#CCCCCC"> and here's some we won't go</font>

1595
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:54,660
through these here but there will be in

1596
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,550
the slideshow that's on the web

1597
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:59,100
configuration examples for how to do

this for cisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> riverstone and juniper</font>

1599
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:04,110
should be relatively useful there's some

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,390
other communities that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may or may</font>

the other thing some folks do or

exchange point communities in other

words if I mad save five exchange points

I may or may not want to mark routes

1615

with with communities that are unique to

1616
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:45,630
that exchange point some folks you have

1617
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:48,930
by having a special pop community for

there are certain prefixes out there in

the world that contain bad people may be

1629

there stammers maybe there are other

1630

kinds of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're given the</font>

option of not sending any traffic to

1637
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:30,120
spammers so it's kind of a two-edged

1638

sword whether you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this again</font>

1639
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,359
I've actually no opinion on whether the

life should be crushed out of scumbag

1641

spammers no opinion there at all and but

1642
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,830
if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this there's a</font>

1647
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:50,790
of wrap things up why go to all this

this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they're there are a couple</font>

enhance flexibility so let's go just to

1663
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,580
take the conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> one step filter</font>

okay the question was<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1717
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,609
monitoring can be tricky for some of

1718
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,530
these things people will help you

1719
01:02:29,609 --> 01:02:32,940
monitor them there are certain peers<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1720
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:35,339
there like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genuity that if you start</font>

1721
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:36,690
sending unequal routing announcements

1722
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:40,190
they'll send you helpful the emails two

1723
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:42,420
or three two or three times a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

1724
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:44,700
but this is one reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's useful</font>

1725
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,440
to have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high level network</font>

1726
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,210
engineering group that's writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

1727
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,260
policies and it's writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1728
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:53,940
configurations and who can go and and

1729
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:56,790
actively investigate and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1730
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">these things are happening you know as</font>

1731
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:00,150
we sit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last tutorial using</font>

1732
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:01,650
something like rancid are using

1733
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:05,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you know another configuration</font>

1734
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:06,839
checking tool can help us a lot because

1735
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,940
you can check and see that that these

1736
01:03:06,839 --> 01:03:11,549
atomic policies that should be in place

1737
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:14,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">for every router configuration are still</font>

1738
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:16,290
in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also do some analysis</font>

1739
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,569
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP announcements you're making</font>

1740
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:20,759
and that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful it is having</font>

1741
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:22,529
peering group or maybe a parent

1742
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,480
coordinator who is cruel enough to

1743
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:26,130
actually look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what routing now since</font>

1744
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,540
you're making and determining if they're

1745
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:29,579
in accordance with your peering policy

1746
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:31,859
and of course the best way to do all

1747
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:33,839
this is automation none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this should</font>

1748
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:36,540
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done by hand everything should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1749
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:38,970
automated using expect scripts using

1750
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:40,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">Perl scripts with net telnet or other</font>

1751
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:46,069
modules how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that answer your</font>

1752
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:48,869
question other questions anyone heckles
