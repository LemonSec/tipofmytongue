say one in five undergrad engineers are

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,079
1970 seems to be kind of a turning point

for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read in a couple of</font>

186
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,760
new faces here so I think it's useful

<font color="#E5E5E5">for you to understand the unusual events</font>

is a quick special to the network world

191
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:26,030
back early in the year 2000 a group of

individuals came together from business

to understand how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> state might</font>

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:45,199
attract high tech business to the region

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,000
at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time a coalition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

coast they also had an interest in

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,670
promoting high technology in the region

203

<font color="#E5E5E5">and in increasing the participation both</font>

the universities<font color="#CCCCCC"> and community colleges</font>

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,260
were also interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this goal so</font>

208
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,420
that they could find places for their

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,550
engineering grads to work that wouldn't

210
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,030
require them to leave the state and a

211
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,459
group of telecommunications companies

212
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,800
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working at the time to understand</font>

213
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,510
how they might best exploit the new

214
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">fiber systems that were being installed</font>

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:24,220
which encircle the Caribbean and Central

216
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,750
and South America and at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

217
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,150
were many billions of dollars being

spent in installing and lighting up

219
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:34,360
these undersea systems so the four

220
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,820
groups in a very unusual set of

221
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,500
circumstances came together and out of

222
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:43,840
those sessions came a single idea which

223
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,060
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> unusual for four individual groups</font>

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,950
in in telecommunications world it's

225
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,920
unusual for even two carriers to agree

226
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">on something so at the time there was a</font>

others in the end by I guess it was

252
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:09,130
about May of that year they awarded the
