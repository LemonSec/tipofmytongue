hi done well we'll see I'm Jeb lindson

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,099
from earthly and yes I wanted to preface

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,259
this with a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I'm not here</font>

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,360
really to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earthlink mostly</font>

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,020
talking about other people and some of

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,419
its confirm rumors and hoping it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,659
I'm going to probably have to flip

38
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,170
pretty quickly through some of these

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,880
slides this I was going to hit this

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,509
anyway just for purely for convenience

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,670
these definitions tier 1 i'm basically

42
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,490
referring to in this presentation as

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,579
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who serve transit to others but</font>

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,610
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy transit themselves tier 2 is</font>

45
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,020
those who buy it from others<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way</font>

46
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,880
of putting it is just what I've got up

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,789
here on the board those who provide

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,818
transit or internet access to autonomous

49
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:12,580
systems and those who provide it to

50
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,690
individuals the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next gen peering centers</font>

51
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,950
it's been fearing centers is something

52
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,170
I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

53
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,970
but forget the idea very quickly and the

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">last thing that I wanted to say is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to nap I mean a legacy</font>

58
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,690
things that I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover here very</font>

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">briefly are the motivations of economics</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly things that have happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

64
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,790
disrupt the market for peering

65
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,890
especially with regard to fear<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and</font>

66
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,260
content but also to some extent with the

67
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,049
tier 1 players and what those

68
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">disruptions are then briefly what I</font>

69
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,320
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those disruptions will</font>

70
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,310
cause to happen in the near future

71
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,799
address a little bit the fear

72
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,290
uncertainty and doubt factor which will

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">always get them making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas and making</font>

74
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,870
presentations and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> expects what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,339
expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in the future and there</font>

76
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,900
are a good number of slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've</font>

77
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,030
actually left out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this presentation</font>

78
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,860
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from an older presentation runs</font>

79
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,209
about an hour but if you download it

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,010
will realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font>

81
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,900
slides and backup which you can refer to

<font color="#E5E5E5">offline but I won't be talking to up</font>

83
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,920
here the role of peering differs pretty

84
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,860
greatly between what I call tier ones

85
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,510
and everybody else to the top level tier

86
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,810
ones as you're probably familiar with

87
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,730
from the Mortons presentations<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission</font>

88
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the description for these</font>

89
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,980
essentially if you're not buying transit

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,000
from somebody you<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely for your business</font>

91
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">on peering you have to have it and it's</font>

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,920
essential to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business you can't</font>

93
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,560
provide vows to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers without</font>

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,410
peering to the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,200
hand most of what we do is we use

96
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,299
peering to supplement transit in order

97
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,768
to save us money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in order to</font>

98
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,720
increase the quality of our routes this

99
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,239
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> new information to almost anybody</font>

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,890
here what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to propose that's a</font>

101
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,350
little bit controversial is that fearing

102
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,200
is usually not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission-critical most of</font>

103
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,080
us that again your mileage may vary as

104
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,750
it says they're there are some who

105
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,128
used puing so aggressively that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

106
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,719
purines were to fall apart then the the

107
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:34,689
capacity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they built for themselves</font>

108
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:36,400
would not allow them to run so most of

109
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:39,580
us we save money we improve our routes

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,138
but we can usually withstand a bit more

111
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">outages than someone like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

112
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">could for example the requirements</font>

113
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,689
differ a little bit as well but I'm

114
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,129
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slide over this one pretty</font>

115
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:52,629
quickly the it flows along I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

116
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">pass by this one this wasn't intended to</font>

117
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:59,500
be here historically the cost of peering

118
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:03,460
had a lot to do with why we did it what

119
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,280
we essentially found was the cost of

120
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,859
transit a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years back made it</font>

121
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,330
very easy for us to justify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the peering</font>

122
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,669
options that were available a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">years back these the numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

124
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,900
here are real numbers but they're

125
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:18,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a little bit skewed the transit</font>

126
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,128
prices from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years ago the</font>

map prices for naps<font color="#CCCCCC"> one two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

128
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:26,199
there are legacy map prices but from

129
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,568
just about five months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so you see</font>

130
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,940
that if the price<font color="#CCCCCC"> of transit where it</font>

131
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,039
used to be it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quite easy to</font>

132
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,080
justify putting in circuits to peering

133
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,300
this is on a per meg basis and we'll see

134
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this graph is similar to let you</font>

135
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,599
see in some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> building Orton's</font>

presentations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use his method for</font>

graphing on the per megabit basis

138
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,319
justification was easy we saved

139
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">ourselves a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money and we improved</font>

140
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,750
our routes but then we had a disruption

141
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,270
in the economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> the economy of peering</font>

142
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:59,500
because transit prices started to drop

143
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:02,020

162
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:49,090
is that it doesn't scale all that

164
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,919
that when you try to scale private

peering on a circuit by Circuit basis

166
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,560
you have a repeated expenditure on

<font color="#E5E5E5">newports every time these circuits every</font>

168

more than anywhere between 20 and maybe

is fundamentally a little bit different

so far and we'll see how that goes so

194

once they realize that they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

to and so what they decided to do based

partly again on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill Norton's economics</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cash for the one-time</font>

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:05,550
tossing cables across the walls to each

217
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:08,910
other and peering at OC 48 OC 192 etc

218
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,800
this has a lot of advantages for them it

219
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,670
allows them to become more independent

220
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,589
from the ilex the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air box to basically</font>

00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,510
it improves their fault tolerance

223
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,520
because of the fact that they can choose

224

very specifically their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber routes</font>

with each other and it's kind of unclear

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,140
at this point where they're going to

239
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:03,360
continue to peer elsewhere they probably

240

will but it remains to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen looking</font>

fundamentally does you'll probably

290
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,370
notice of course that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a new</font>

idea there's there are no new ideas in

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,510
suddenly provision a single port and

then over and over again provision more

306
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,449
tremendously well it's much lower than

those above them start to gravitate

towards these new centers this has

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,709
already happened you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily see this</font>

369
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,620
in how rapidly the new centers at least

370
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:29,630
some particular ones have gained in

371

373
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,269
is that once you've got a certain

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,469
captive market for transit services and

380
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,810
I've got everybody who provides transit

in the whole region in one building have

382

been compete with each other and if you

383

want to just peer it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all the other colocation well don't</font>

390
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:18,800

cases several players of Metro Ethernet

394
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,920
so it becomes very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy for you to</font>

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,110
appear from where you already are

396
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,740
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tremendous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of need for</font>

that minute the pressure will probably

399
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:41,899
increase to replace the legacy circuits

<font color="#E5E5E5">because you pretty much get the idea</font>

414
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,329
already the old picture of private

415
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,609
peering looks something like this I an

416
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,230
attached to you to him to the old map

417

and the old map I get those guys over

418
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:27,470
there I get OC 3 as OC twelves but again

419
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">same with the tier ones the efficiency</font>

583
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,080
if one of them goes bankrupt right not

584
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,330
that but what are all the one that you

585
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,730
had up there already went bankrupt and I

586
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,580
place a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money down a bet that</font>

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,620
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them probably will and so that's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do the math</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and see that they can't make money doing</font>

590
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:54,980
that so that's where the Super Centers

591
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,840
you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the value chain of</font>

592
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,919
bring all the people in and then other

593
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,529
people come and they could eventually

594
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,020
make money somewhere else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was I</font>

596
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,389
to justify putting a lot of time energy

597
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:10,010
into something that isn't clear that any

598
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,500
of the companies will survive yeah

599
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:15,679
because I i would also disagree i think

one common set of RFPs at the top level

commitment to go into there and they

660
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,040
quite visibly in you know vocally have

00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,590
you can pretty much rely on them being
