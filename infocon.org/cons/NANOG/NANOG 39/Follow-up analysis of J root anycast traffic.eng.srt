00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:04,979
good morning I'm Pete barber I work with

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,080
bear sign we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking</font>

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,660
about traffic source analysis for<font color="#CCCCCC"> j-bird</font>

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,570
anycast instances so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history about what kind of analysis</font>

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,470
was done<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we before we started</font>

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this on root servers there wasn't</font>

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,580
a whole lot of research that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was done</font>

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,799
beforehand and we had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people openly</font>

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,859
questioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether we should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,680
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast for root servers after we</font>

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,599
started to any casting some people with

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,980
in verisign mark hosters<font color="#CCCCCC"> matt larson</font>

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,130
myself put together a presentation

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,700
called life and times of<font color="#E5E5E5"> j root and that</font>

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,160
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ANA 32 within that</font>

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,360
presentation we analyzed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data of</font>

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,500
some of the j root sites that we had at

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we had maybe eight or</font>

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,000
nine at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time we analyzed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data in</font>

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,250
different ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found some</font>

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
interesting things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of all we</font>

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,789
got a lot of non priming queries to the

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,730
old je root which we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

25
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,789
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to fully explain and</font>

26
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,349
the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is is that some</font>

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,359
of the IP addresses we saw were at more

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,760
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than one site and sometimes in very</font>

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,049
rapid succession so we're going to

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,610
really focus on that second thing that

31
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,470
we've discovered within the first

32
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,939
presentation some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people did some</font>

33
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,408
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> about root server anycast and</font>

34
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,429
there are some other very good

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,409
presentations out there most notably

36
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,930
ones will list here Peter booth and

37
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,090
Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush put together a presentation</font>

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,710
about highlighting anycast instabilities

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,770
and what they did is they had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

40
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,559
bunch of volunteers run TCP and UDP

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,039
probes and when some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them when the</font>

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,820
conclusions came in they found that

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,500
there were some rotting weirdness and

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP and UDP probes have different</font>

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,820
failure rates most of the people who did

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">this were all volunteers so we think</font>

47
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,320
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sample base was all wrong</font>

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,898
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't necessarily mean that all</font>

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people who were doing that the data</font>

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,670
analysis and the collection were

51
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,810
volunteers and they're a little more

52
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,969
clue phul than some of the people at the

53
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,280
edge of the internet so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

54
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,380
the sample<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little biased that way</font>

55
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,880
another presentation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS anycast</font>

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,519
ability dumb i Donna care

57
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,829
he looked at DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> mon the right monitor</font>

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,720
from 77 different sites around the world

59
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,850
and again this is another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

60
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,140
situations where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sample base isn't</font>

61
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,640
really representative of what's out

62
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,500
there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet Lorenzo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Colletti</font>

63
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,820
put together in a presentation called

64
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,220
the effects of any cast on kaeru

65
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,750
performance and his analysis included

66
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,400
stability and its effect and proponents

67
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,740
performance and some of the things he

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,270
found was that one percent of the unique

69
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,470
source IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> switched the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sites</font>

70
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like some of the stuff we've seen</font>

71
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,440
for junior he also only<font color="#E5E5E5"> did five hours</font>

72
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,450
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> president worth of analysis of</font>

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,340
the data and we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a full</font>

74
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,750
day's worth of data collection another

75
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,000
presentation was operational experience

76
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:59,670
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp unicast by Matt living Barrett</font>

Lyon and Todd Underwood they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the</font>

78
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,760
conclusion that there was no real

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">be wondering why we're doing this</font>

81
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,320
presentation if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot of</font>

82

work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us before and we're not trying</font>

83
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,320
to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> stones at the other people's</font>

84
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,250
projects at all in fact we're just

85
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,109
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add a little bit more</font>

86
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,240
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the total</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question of any</font>

87
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,530
cast for root servers and we want to do

88
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,670
a follow up with their own analysis with

89
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:27,180
more data so for this presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

90
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,280
put together we<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected information</font>

91
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,040
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our at the time 19 anycast</font>

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,020
instances now we've got 25 but we had

93
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,870
this uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did the data collection it</font>

94
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,600
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 19 all of the j-word instances</font>

95
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,459
are sourced out of a s26<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 15 we have</font>

96
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,579
a mix of global and local instances and

97
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,530
when we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> local instance we just mean</font>

98
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,590
it's purely appearing only or upstream

99
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">ralph filters the j roots do have a mix</font>

100
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,600
of transit and fearing for this

101
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation or for the data collection</font>

102
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,359
we did two separate data packet packet

103
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,459
captures the first one was for UDP and

104
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,160
that was inbound only that did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

105
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,800
measure anything fun like a TC pit<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp a</font>

106
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,900
TC bit being sent out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS</font>

107
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,590
response and the second one when did we

108
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,870
did was for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP bi-directional packet</font>

109
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,530
capture each one of these was for about

110
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,608
24 hours they were not overlapping and

111
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,590
we did our<font color="#CCCCCC"> best to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that every</font>

112
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,888
active anycast instance was represent

113
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,388
the teeth in the data collection so when

114
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,889
we did all this collection our goal was

115
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,330
to answer these three questions and

116
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,360
we've actually had more<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions come</font>

117
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,469
up since<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis so what</font>

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,090
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> distribution of the source</font>

119
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,699
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> would we see across all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

120
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,810
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> any cast instances and can we</font>

121
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,030
explain the type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of day that we're</font>

122
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,410
seeing and can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we determine if the data</font>

123
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,619
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing is causing a problem</font>

124
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,139
or not with the UDP packet capture it

127
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,180
and we did a staggered start and stop

00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,440
for each<font color="#E5E5E5"> site it was hard to get all the</font>

131
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,460
we had 335 million total queries and

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,810
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not the total amount of</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the source IP address so</font>

143
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,320
obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the client who does the query</font>

144
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,090
to the j root instance the second one is

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be transitions so this is a</font>

146
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,179
circumstance<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we have the query</font>

147
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,550
bouncing between one and cast instance

148
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,620
je root or another and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

149
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,910
seen on the first instance of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> j</font>

150
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,060
root in a cast and then seen on<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

151
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,680
that's counted as one transition the

152
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,210
site<font color="#CCCCCC"> says the total number of any cast</font>

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,820
instances this client has been singing

154
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,039
on and the simultaneous seconds if you

155
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">take the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP dumps and truncate the</font>

156
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,360
milliseconds and only look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at every one</font>

157
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,770
second bucket<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we did for</font>

158
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,070
this and that's what we consider is a

159
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,020
simultaneous so two servers talking to

160
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,330
two different anycast instances of<font color="#E5E5E5"> j</font>

161
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,099
root within the same second is

162
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,650
considered simultaneous for the purposes

163
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,030
so this the total<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of seconds is</font>

164
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,409
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of seconds any of the</font>

165
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,260
instances<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive traffic from this</font>

166
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:16,410
address and the simultaneous is just a

167
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,450
ratio the specific sites will use a

168
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,070
decoder ring on the right side here we

169
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,590
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 19 instances that we had during</font>

170
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,830
this analysis time and you'll see the

171
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,090
letters listed up so we also faced a

172
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,680
difficult question whether we're going

173
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,080
to mask the original source IP address

174
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,280
us or not so the addresses you're going

175
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,060
to see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation are true</font>

176
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,520
when we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

177
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,560
hi the IP addresses are anonymize them

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,270
or anyway we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to point</font>

179
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">these problems out or make fun of any</font>

180
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,539
providers or<font color="#E5E5E5"> name server operators we</font>

181
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,250
just really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what the</font>

182
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,440
original reasoning was between the

183
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,880
hopping around so if you see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

184
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,830
these addresses you recognize please get

185
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,540
with me after the after the presentation

186
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,889
it will go over this is the table this

187
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,470
one is sorted by the percent

188
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,700
simultaneously you'll see the first one

189
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,020
up there doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a whole lot of</font>

190
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,550
activity to the site so it's not really

191
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but out of all the</font>

192
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:11,040
activity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jared cloud</font>

193
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,690
we had fifty percent simultaneous if

194
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,360
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> distribution</font>

195
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,650
of those top 30 addresses we have them

196
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,630
distributed all over the world so it's

197
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,539
not one particular region which is prone

198
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,460
to do this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the same data but</font>

199
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,410
ordered on different columns this one is

200
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,210
ordered by how many sites how many

201
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jared anycast sites one of the</font>

202
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,280
clients has talked to and we have what

203
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,290
25 sources here who've talked to four

204
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,080
different anycast instances of jerry

205
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,430
within one 24-hour period and you'll see

206
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,340
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these guys like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first one</font>

207
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,350
listed here had 93 times that he moved

208
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,700
between one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jared any cast instance to</font>

209
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,840
another and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only works out to about</font>

210
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:54,240
point two percent of the total traffic

211
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:56,429
he did to us so let's listing out the 30

212
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,979
most sites for geographic distribution

213
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,750
for this graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you'll also see that</font>

214
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:04,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's distributed all over the world and</font>

215
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:07,680
not particularly one region or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

216
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,120
this is the same tape data<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this</font>

217
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,900
time sorted by the number of transitions

218
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,150
the top one on<font color="#E5E5E5"> here did 13,000 492</font>

219
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,340
transitions that mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it went from</font>

220
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,409
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> JAY root server to another David</font>

221
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,179
server 13,000 times within a 24-hour

222
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,490
period which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty significant that</font>

223
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a only nine percent of a more</font>

224
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,100
simultaneous but we'll see that there

225
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,960
was a lot of activity this is a

226
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,330
histogram here it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two log scale</font>

227
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,250
histogram of all the traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

228
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,680
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go back to this slide here in the</font>

229
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,110
beginning high level statistics this is

230
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,010
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the total list of all the</font>

231
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,010
addresses that we saw here

232
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,380
so you'll see that we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small</font>

233
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">group of people who were doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

234
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,290
transitions to us this is the if you

235
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,640
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see the we have a thousand</font>

236
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,199
sources here who've only done one

237
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,970
transition throughout the day so

238
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything really gets interesting from</font>

239
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,980
from the left side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> graph 20 where</font>

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,450
we have a few people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing an awful lot</font>

241
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,970
of transitions this is a Geo plot of the

242
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,010
30 most transitions of the sites that

243
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,760
did the 30 most transitions between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in cast instances or more and this</font>

245
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,110
is a distribution of all the 5600 source

246
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,480
addresses which contacted more than one

248
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,290
analysis you'll notice that these plots

249
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,270
are all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and there's no</font>

250
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:35,020
particular region that they're happening

251
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,720
in so we did we plotted all these out

252
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then we looked at them and we picked</font>

253
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,380
out which ones were interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

254
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,520
and not really looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data but</font>

255
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,370
looking at the plots up and you'll see

256
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,590
the plots the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few slides we only</font>

257
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,890
looked at the sites that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had queries</font>

258
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,630
from a given IP address and amplitude in

259
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,000
case that the query volume was at the

260
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,260
sentence the first two graphs are the

261
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,370
type of transition that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

262
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,830
normally expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an inter-caste</font>

263
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,590
instance and this is one of them so here

264
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a client here doing queries to</font>

265
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:07,630
the anycast instance of Dulles Virginia

266
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,099
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> until about 8pm UTC and then they do</font>

267
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,130
one transition to the site<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we had</font>

268
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,020
in Mountain View California and this is

269
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,460
a similar we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who is</font>

270
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,220
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> her anycast instance in</font>

271
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Amsterdam and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around mid or a.m.</font>

272
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,250
UTC they made the transition to Miami

273
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,870
tour anyhow je root in Miami so you can

274
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,740
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a we also plotted out</font>

275
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,210
some of the ones which were more

276
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,460
simultaneous you see the one who's

277
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,290
basically ping pong in between Tokyo and

278
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,610
mountain view and the times that he's

279
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,660
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us he's switching back and</font>

280
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:40,090
forth between Tokyo mountain view this

281
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">is one of the clients is doing a low</font>

282
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,030
amount of traffic to us but you can see

283
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:49,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are several transitions zero</font>

284

talking to a gyro distance within the

situations where we see someone who's

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,079
making multiple transitions we have

315
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,559
Singapore for just a second then back to

316

Amsterdam laying<font color="#E5E5E5"> down a soul so this is</font>

sort of a b c d e CB a type of

319
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:11,800
very little traffic to us with the four

320
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:12,850
separate transitions and this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

321
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,709
the situations<font color="#E5E5E5"> where there are very few</font>

322
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:20,800
simultaneous hits but many transitions

323
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:22,329
so it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ping pong this was one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

324
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,459
the more pathological situations here

325
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,559
where we saw a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

326
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:30,969
transitions with the very few

327
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:33,309
simultaneous so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did our UDP</font>

328
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,350
analysis we did a TCP packet capture and

329
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:37,120
we captured about 25 hours of TCP

330
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,839
packets out of the high level statistics

331
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,230
we captured<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6000 DNS responses we sent</font>

332
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,139
out out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 238,000 TCP connections</font>

333
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:51,309
connections established and of them we

334
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:52,749
saw 22,000 unique source IP addresses so

335
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we did look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the resets and we wanted</font>

336
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find out what the source of the</font>

337
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,639
resets were and some of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

338
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">j</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root server would give out a reset</font>

339
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,290
were perfectly expected like an idol

340
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,329
connection so we did count the number of

341
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,519
resets that we had that we're not

342
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,189
preceded by sin from the same IP

343
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,160
important

344
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,840
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we found 9,000 Dunlap's</font>

345
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,589
resets which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really have an</font>

346
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,000
answer for you we sound saw resets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

347
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">five different source addresses from two</font>

348
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,380
different sites so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see so</font>

349
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,180
many resets that we didn't really have

350
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,460
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that part of the analysis</font>

351
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,109
we do have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a next presentation</font>

352
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,350
about why there's so many recess that's

353
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:32,690
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> topic there the real</font>

354
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,760
question is why are we getting any TCP

355
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,070
queries at all the JRE if you're

356
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,600
familiar with DNS most of the activity

357
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,550
to a root server in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact just about all</font>

358
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,760
of it should be UDP and should not be

359
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,199
falling back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP so we came up with a</font>

360
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,819
couple scenarios to try to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

361
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and either the root servers are sending</font>

362
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,180
TC bits or the resolvers just decided to

363
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,250
use TCP and they continue to use in our

364
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">26 our UDP packet capture was only</font>

365
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,310
inbound so we couldn't really measure

366
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,010
the number of TC bits that we sent back

367
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,930
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a half a million inbound query</font>

368
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,600
and matched them with the outbound and

369
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">we saw for TC bits being sent out so</font>

370
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,040
it's clearly not a matter of the TC bits

371
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,050
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending out most of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

372
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the activity we saw on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP was all just</font>

373
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,469
people who wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use TCP there was</font>

374
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,770
no other rational reason we could come

375
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">up for of the tcp queries that we saw</font>

376
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,990
they were overwhelmingly type MX they

377
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,760
were what we think probably spammers

378
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,990
trying to use a trying to connect to the

379
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,370
root service directly get their answer

380
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,810
faster we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know we haven't</font>

381
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,250
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> done analysis on the clients a</font>

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,760
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of more behind firewalls we're</font>

383
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,710
unable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it we really highly suspect</font>

384
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,830
that this tcp querying without you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

385
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,540
first we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know why we'd</font>

386
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,540
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to know if anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has any</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP and continuing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use TCP we would</font>

390
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,180
of the conclusions we found here is is

391
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,250
that most of the interesting multi-site

392
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:02,000
traffic looked explainable by<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

393
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,320
load balancing and we do have some some

394
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,640
uncomfortable questions which came up

395
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,500
with that with this with the unmatched

396
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP resets that our je root server sent</font>

397
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,080
out some of the iterative resolvers just

398
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,850
like to use TCP and they prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

399
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,380
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the vast majority of the</font>

400
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,740

401
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP and it looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the analysis for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP dns over any</font>

403
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,100

really appear to be correctly formatted

anyway but we'd also liked any more

research about that for the record we'd

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:06,669
hi it's rising when you ask questions

450
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,230
can you introduce yourself and state

451
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,949
some affiliation for class x<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris</font>

454
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,760
like for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know North American</font>

455
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,949
cities like Dulles to Atlanta and back

00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of seems normal to me what is</font>

457
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,240
interesting is seeing people flipping

458
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,550
from source IP is flipping between say

459
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,270
dauntless<font color="#E5E5E5"> and amsterdam I was wondering</font>

460
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:34,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you've done any sort of geo-located</font>

462
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,300
of the source address that are flipping

463
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,280
between servers that are that

464
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,309
geographically diverse to see where

465
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,649
exactly are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from I mean are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

466

are they<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> location that's a similar</font>

00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,409
both that a topology change<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

469
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,120
explain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well since you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> door saying your intern app will say</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Atlanta</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> site and the dell aside</font>

472
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,090
are both not using intern apps he was

473
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,010
obvious reasons wasn't sort of hopping

474
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,629
around happen as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam and why</font>

475
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,429
Amsterdam always showed up is one of the

476
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,720
guys hopping around it is a very well

477
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,030
period connection that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

478
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,679
Amsterdam so that that partially

479
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,000
explains it have we<font color="#CCCCCC"> done any geolocation</font>

480
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,070
for that that sounds like an excellent

481
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">next talk topic and i'll write that down</font>

482
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,379
because it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like something that</font>

483
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,370
would be very interesting for me and

484
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,400
probably other people in the audience

485
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,750
here got mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> coster's lurking in the</font>

486
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,419
corner wanted to say something

487
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,540
desperately so we actually did<font color="#CCCCCC"> geolocate</font>

488
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:28,179
those that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top speakers that were</font>

489
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,790
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting in this case so so</font>

490
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:33,340
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it what I would expect to</font>

491
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:35,678
see is that we from areas that didn't

492
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,168
have a lot of bandwidth that you would

493
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,910
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot sort of more sort of per</font>

494
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,950
packet load balancing situations to

495
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,470
actually occur<font color="#CCCCCC"> you we see a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more of</font>

496
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">those sort of issues in the areas that</font>

497
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,120
didn't have high bandwidth in what we

498
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,590
found and this time around is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

499
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,059
of these were actually coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

500
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,059
states which I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font>

501
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,290
I've got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions I'll ask one</font>

502
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,510
and then let's Emile's presumably you'll

503
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,840
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Brian Brian Dixon from</font>

504
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,720
affiliates I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if in the</font>

505
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,669
simultaneous calculations you adjusted

506
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,060
for the round trip times

507
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:16,960
from the locations the j root instances

508
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,460
and the origin I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

509
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,760
really found a correlation between round

510
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,230
trip times in the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a house</font>

511
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,000
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant in terms of</font>

512
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,970
before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the simultaneous</font>

513
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,190
calculation did you subtract off the

514
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,690
actual round trip time since now now we

515
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">just add that would be a little bit too</font>

516
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,930
much so we just truncated<font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers</font>

517
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:41,620
and who's that maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> was close enough</font>

518
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:43,870
yeah you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right in the middle but well</font>

519
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,449
I'm next Danny move here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

520
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:49,030
ran your list the top 30 through you

521
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,800
know an<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS look up just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

522
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">no and I figured I would see a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

523
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,649
obvious folks here I was actually

524
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,300
surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was a pretty wide</font>

525
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,950
distribution and nothing stuck out like

526
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,990
you know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might you know</font>

527
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,910
play play in particular tricks or other

528
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,840
things other than like got IBM event

529
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,220
services you know prefix so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

530
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,720
know that na s distribution and the

531
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,200
geoip stuff I thought was a pretty

532
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,750
clever idea on the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP resets and</font>

533
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,400
also i'm sorry the yeah the spurious

534
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,860
resets<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess you're saying it could be</font>

535
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,840
folks looking to mitigate attacks and do

536
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,820
likes orthocenter source authentication

537
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,620
and they say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they receive a UDP</font>

538
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,149
query then they hold it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and see if</font>

539
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,949
the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> was true but you know sending</font>

540
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:31,750
a reese reset by that or the I guess I'm

541
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,250
or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP bit where some people say I'm</font>

542
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">not accepting these UDP queries from</font>

543
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,090
these sources anymore i'm going to force

544
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">tcp transfers and then they proxy those</font>

545
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,879
sort of things so those two kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

546
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,010
models<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the sources</font>

547
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,630
across that but i suspect that either or

548
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,210
both those may help address some of your

549
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,150
queries i'm not sure what percentage of

550
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the total you know that made up so there</font>

551
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,790
are enough people out there playing

552
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,040
those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tricks today that you know</font>

553
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,870
it might have an impact on your data set

554
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll ask you a question do you</font>

555
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,659
know of any papers which<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe that</font>

556
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,640
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're less interested to read about</font>

557
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,600
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know several so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be happy to</font>

558
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">send you any moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

Scott and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read internet I'm wondering</font>

560

<font color="#CCCCCC">if you've done any trace routes to the</font>

multi the simultaneous querying sources

to see if the source IP is actually in

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,720
two

564
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,909
diverse physical locations perhaps

565
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,820
someone's doing any cast and is then

566
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,110
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anycast nodes so in</font>

567
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to the geolocation to be</font>

568
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,459
interesting just to see if this IP

569
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,660
address is the same server from both

570
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,820
nodes or if it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different</font>

571
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,440
physical servers or the same IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> now i</font>

572
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,060
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did now that you bring that up</font>

573
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,320
that sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would have answered</font>

574
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:45,470
some questions like Michael Richardson

575
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,000
from accelerants I'm curious I know rude

576
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,160
operators are often complaining about

577
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,620
the large amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of garbage that they</font>

578
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,540
get inquiries and I was actually

579
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,250
surprised at the amount a number of

580
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">continuous queries from some of these</font>

581
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,950
weird sources and I'm wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

582
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,630
subtracted any of the garbage<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff from</font>

583
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,120
that if you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> get such continuous</font>

584
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,250
use oh yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much garbage on on</font>

585
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">je root</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's if I ever want to get</font>

586
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,880
depressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how people mess up their</font>

587
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,590
dns so badly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just look at all the next</font>

588
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">domains</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jared gives out and that's</font>

589
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,429
that's a whole nother subject so so in

590
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,570
your queries you don't actually have the

591
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,400
whole use that you have at least the

592
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,159
type there are you are you able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

593
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">with your data and subtract what I would</font>

594
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,940
you consider to be garbage quote

595
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,620
requests no we lump them all in good

596
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,540
good traffic versus bad traffic it's

597
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,310
really requires a sort of a human I to

598
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,810
figure out if the trash just like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

599
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,879
really curious why there was so much

600
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:39,260
traffic from any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those nodes through</font>

601
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:42,290
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers at all mm-hmm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks follow</font>

602
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:45,950
up to the one question<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago fellow who is</font>

603
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:48,770
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about simultaneous queries from</font>

604
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,570
possibly anycast instances have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also</font>

605
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,050
looked at the possibility of hijacked

606
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:55,429
address space where two different

607
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">parties are using the same address space</font>

608
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,500
in disparate locations I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

609
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,139
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one possible explanation</font>

610
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,280
that would explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but that we did</font>

611
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at that briefly but I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

612
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found any correlation yet have</font>

613
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,520
to be a lot of hi Jackie yep one other

614
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,940
question is regarding the per packet

615
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,600
load balancer have you made any efforts

616
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,600
or investigated at all announcing the

617
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,750
prefixes at different locations JK

618
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">anycast locations with different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

619
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,040
origin attribute values to break the

620
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,310
ties the answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is yes and Mark</font>

621
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,510
will tell

622
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,970
actually with these are the interesting

623
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,790
graphs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question we</font>

624
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,320
didn't do anything with<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp so but that</font>

625
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,800
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we did do is we</font>

626
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,000
did contact each of those interesting

627
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,010
IPS that you saw that we're interesting

628
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,900
graphs we contacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> each of those guys</font>

629
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,000
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing and</font>

630
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,040
once you did come back isn't oh yeah

631
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,940
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing per packet load balancing is</font>

632
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,159
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so so but we showed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

633
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">this behavior said hey this may break</font>

634
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:07,000
some other stuff later on but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be be</font>

635
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:13,870
aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so they are aware</font>

636
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:17,380
of that in the future i joined<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wessels</font>

637
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,850
from the measurement factory the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

638
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,070
before UDP could be explained by

639
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:23,740
something recently on the net nog

640
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:26,020
mailing list which is that ssh port

641
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,020
forwarding does not work for UDP but it

642
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,940
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp but would that explain</font>

643
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the amex queries that we saw as part no</font>

644
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those are clearly spammers yeah</font>

645
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:38,410
I glad someone agrees with being on that

646
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:40,240
I guess that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan blacks yeah that is</font>

647
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,100
it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> good stand by I guess that's</font>

648
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,550
it any other questions thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>
