00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:08,040
right usual problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> um good afternoon</font>

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,769
everybody and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a bit of</font>

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,120
result from having probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much</font>

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,710
time near a play and certainly the

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,500
flight to get here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brisbane took a</font>

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:22,519
long time so here we go this is not

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">really meant to be an advert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,519
route aggregation document I talked

9
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last lightning talk but it's</font>

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,028
kind of covers the same introduction but

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,140
I've just stepped on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,559
further<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you something</font>

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting so anyway the right</font>

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,370
aggregation documents while the links

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,379
try to do this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the membership even</font>

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,019
though the members voted for it it just

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,899
didn't work my cues can tell you more

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,170
about that routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group at</font>

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,870
right then took this a step further so

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,090
along with my cues and Rob Evans from<font color="#CCCCCC"> UK</font>

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we produce this document with a lot</font>

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,829
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good feedback from the industry at</font>

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,559
large and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> good aggregation</font>

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,220
recommendation should be so this is now

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,619
being published as ripe 399 that was

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,590
done right second or third of January

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,060
this year so that's finally out

28
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,860
discusses the history of aggregation the

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,990
causes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aggregation impacts in the</font>

30
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,909
global routing system available

31
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,679
solutions and puts forward some

32
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,049
recommendations for I recipes I'm not

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover any of the historical</font>

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,670
stuff but i'll put the recommendations

35
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,890
up basically trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage people</font>

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,180
to announce the initial allocation as a

37
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,450
single entity where<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible try make</font>

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,280
sure that subsequent allocations

39
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,820
aggregated if they are suitably bitwise

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,990
aligned<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always that</font>

41
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,908
in that case but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes they are</font>

42
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,460
third one is prudent subdivision of

43
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,799
aggregates for<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,839
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of well i got my 32</font>

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">classies from whichever registry and we</font>

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,979
just spray them out any interface and

47
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,139
hope something works as happens a lot of

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,560
times is trying to actually figure out

49
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you meant to subdivide lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,229
enhancements have been around it all

51
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,229
applies to ipv6 as well

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,890
now the new stuff trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at some</font>

53
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,659
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DI gregation that's I'm going on</font>

been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for a long time Tony Bates</font>

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,549
started all that all off probably

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:31,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">mid-90s thing was 94 95 he started that</font>

off Jeff used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now maintains all that</font>

59
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:35,200
it's a very very extensive suite of

60
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,390
reports and tools you can pretty much

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,179
find out anything about the BGP table

62
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,750
you could want I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the writing</font>

63
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,120
report that i do in 99 so that split the

64
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,290
side report basically into regional

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,549
internet registry regions basically so

66
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,298
we could find out what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening in</font>

67
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:57,400
each part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world so one of the</font>

68
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,049
summary things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do is produce something</font>

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,540
called maximum aggregation which is

70
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:05,980
basically aggregating by origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> s so it</font>

71
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,440
does also mean I ignore any traffic

72
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,060
engineering efforts but it does show me

73
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,180
roughly what the routing table could be

74
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,849
of everybody really aggregated back to

75
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,769
the origin s I know do it in a global

76
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:20,950
basis as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as regional internet</font>

77
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:24,190
registry basis and well a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago</font>

78
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,959
got an email from simon limon saying mmm

79
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,510
can you add in this the aggregation

80
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,519
factor so show the routing table size

81
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,440
over the aggregated size and we can map

82
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,849
how this goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah well I could put</font>

83
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it's going to be pretty</font>

84
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:40,060
consistent over the years I was wrong

85
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,430
it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting bigger and it's</font>

86
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,810
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger quite quickly if we look</font>

87
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the original Internet's i've called</font>

88
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:52,269
it so roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> North America and Europe</font>

89
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:54,578
so a global table 210,000 prefixes the

90
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:58,810
global average average the aggregation

91
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,549
factor but 1.85 North America's 103,000

92
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,739
prefixes contribute to the tables to

93
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:07,629
1.69 which is all fine good ripe region

94
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:11,290
44,000 prefixes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1.5 three that's</font>

95
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:14,590
all nice next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide is not so nice is</font>

96
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:17,440
your Pacific 47,000 prefixes but 2.48

97
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,649
the aggregation Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3,000 prefixes</font>

98
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,360
2.58 Caribbean Latin America 14,000

99
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:25,650
prefixes 3.4 so 3.4 times more

100
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,930
prefixes then they could really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

101
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,299
announcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregate so</font>

almost three years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and there</font>

120
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,490
they were actually started off at the

at a high speed some all little bit

123
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,180
worried about at all sir probably

124
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,818
running out of time but I've got some of

125
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,129
the suspects here like the number one

don't steal this slide from Todd I

<font color="#CCCCCC">this it was just it was just amazing to</font>

savings<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are possible it's</font>

147
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,969
absolutely amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sophia basically</font>

148
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,490
decided what the heck we'll just throw

149
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:40,879
out all / 24 s and everybody else can

150
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">suffer for it North America</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will have</font>

151
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,189
got our usual friends they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered</font>

00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:48,229
in cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and a few others Latin</font>

America<font color="#CCCCCC"> Union ettes being aggregated</font>

154
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:52,758
like that for a long long long<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time</font>

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,199
and there is other ones there again

156
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:59,120
major savings possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe notice</font>

157
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,719
most of these service providers tender

158
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,729
tend to be the newer ones the the

159
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:06,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term old favorites don't really</font>

160
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:11,000
appear on that list apart from you<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit</font>

161
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:13,999
702 so but otherwise it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,620
newer ones sob servations well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

163
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I just think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this as newer Gulf or</font>

164
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,050
big Gulf appearing between the older and

165
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:23,270
the newer Internet remember that the

166
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,979
newer Internet is growing rapidly as few

167
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,719
folks have been saying and once these

168
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,810
guys get as big as the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

169
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,360
this part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and in Europe yes</font>

170
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,770
I really don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to try and</font>

171
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,389
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can buy lots more</font>

172
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,688
memory from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router for the rioters</font>

173
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:43,849
and so forth the ripe 399 document is

174
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:45,080
only recommendation hoping that the

175
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:47,120
regional internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> registries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

176
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,969
actually point people<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it I will</font>

177
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people at it there's</font>

178
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,750
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of training available with</font>

179
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">tutorials and so forth available</font>

180
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,990
hopefully people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make more</font>

181
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,129
useless to try and figure out what to do

182
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:05,210
final slide make it a good bgp practice

183
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:07,419
document thank you are there any

184
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,419
questions

185
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,819
yes sir Christmas Chris would feel

186
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">internap were those d aggregation</font>

187
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:20,710
measurements done before<font color="#CCCCCC"> or after the</font>

188
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">earthquake oh those were done yes boss</font>

189
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">day before yesterday it's like very very</font>

190
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,190
fresh numbers but the graph that you saw

191
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,900
that's gone all the way back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the time</font>

192
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">they are started okay so safe to assume</font>

193
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,380
that most of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aggregations bet</font>

194
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,179
particularly in Asia pack was in place

195
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,659
before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earthquake that oh yes okay</font>

196
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:40,149
thank you yes sir Dana Blair Cisco given

197
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:43,659
that some<font color="#E5E5E5"> D aggregations probably</font>

198
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:48,360
unavoidable it is there any idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

199
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,360
setting a tolerable limit for this ratio

200
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,950
well I've played around with Jeff

201
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:57,040
Houston's data from the side report in

202
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,080
this bgp report and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

203
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,569
fifteen percent of the aggregation is

204
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,290
necessary for traffic engineering that's

205
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:08,740
a guess that setting a limit means i

206
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,510
don't know how you how you do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

207
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,610
just I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the global norm and I</font>

208
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,160
just hope that most people can get

209
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:21,810
somewhere close to what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nobel global</font>

210
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,810
norm is excellent thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>
