1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:07,500
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you can kind of</font>

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,099
think of this as a research forum talk

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,549
that got a little bit lost I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,049
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you today about some work that</font>

5
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:19,080
mostly has been done by one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,180
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> yi wang but we've also been</font>

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,880
working with annika latina from guavas

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,429
and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> professor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sue the</font>

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,510
subject of this work is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:38,190
basically this we want to basically

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:42,589
figure out ways to help you folks detect

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:45,930
and locate<font color="#CCCCCC"> network disruptions inside</font>

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,300
your own networks quickly now you may

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,309
already be thinking you have ways to do

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,239
this and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

16
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,730
reason I'm here I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end</font>

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,940
actually with a bunch of questions here

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,500
actually to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn a little bit learn a</font>

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,718
little bit more from you about how these

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,140
types of things are done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how well</font>

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">based your current techniques work today</font>

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,659
but I'll talk to you a little bit about

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,650
the approach that we've taken to solving

24
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,400
this problem another reason I'm here is

25
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:21,509
to get more real data to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us improve</font>

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,240
our techniques because this the result

27
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the our algorithms that I'm going to</font>

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,060
show you today we're based on the

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">Abilene backbone network because that</font>

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,100
data is readily<font color="#CCCCCC"> available of course it</font>

31
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,158
would be nice to try this the types of

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,039
techniques we're developing and in other

33
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,630
networks and scenarios as well so we're

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,610
definitely interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with</font>

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,839
you to improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> these techniques as I</font>

36
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,670
mentioned you're probably already

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,710
thinking well I know how to find

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">disruptions already I have you know</font>

39
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:00,329
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many ways to do this with SNMP</font>

40
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:04,798
traps sis logs netcool etc what we're

41
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:07,439
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know can we apply</font>

42
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,330
some new types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complementary</font>

43
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,120
techniques and looking at complementary

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,770
data sets to helps help you deal better

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,960
with the massive amounts of data

46
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,850
noise that the sum of these tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,550
techniques are known to generate so

48
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:25,260
basically noise reduction is is is one

49
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:28,440
of the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> goals the other is fast</font>

50
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,329
detection so to some extent some of the

51
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,160
tools out there may already do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

52
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">well and that's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something I'm</font>

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:40,200
here to learn a bit more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> from from</font>

54
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:44,280
you folks so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the two the two</font>

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">main issues we're trying to get it with</font>

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,580
looking at these these new types of

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,620
techniques and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell you in</font>

58
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">a minute just you know what's what's</font>

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,080
particularly new and interesting I think

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,739
about the techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,700
at in more detail but the the key idea

62
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,290
basically is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking at</font>

63
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,589
network-wide correlation and analysis of

64
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:11,820
of network events so rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

65
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">at single router outputs or you know</font>

66
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,850
graph by graph what's going on at single

67
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,549
network devices what we're doing is

68
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,100
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> on-the-fly building models of</font>

69
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,510
you know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on across many</font>

70
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,480
different routers in the network and

71
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,100
looking for correlated lips across those

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,200
and saying well if<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things are</font>

73
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,450
if things are happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">different places at once that may</font>

75
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,049
indicate something that's that's

76
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,500
interesting so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll get to that in just</font>

77
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:45,150
a minute as I mentioned this is just a

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,400
first step we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking at</font>

79
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">complementary data sources you know to</font>

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing things you're probably</font>

81
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,340
already looking at like SNMP and so

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,070
forth we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's probably</font>

83
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,370
other places to look that may help in

84
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,780
the goals that I talked about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

85
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,530
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning that is in terms of</font>

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,570
noise reduction as I mentioned this is

87
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,910
just a first step we're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

88
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing data inside das in particular</font>

89
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,079
we're looking at routing changes

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,200
experienced by all the routers in the

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,010
backbone so we're currently looking

92
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,320
extending some of these techniques by

93
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,710
looking at things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP data as well</font>

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,450
but it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly possible that we</font>

95
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,760
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be looking at other two</font>

96
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,500
other data sources as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so when I end</font>

97
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,180
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the questions that's where</font>

98
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,710
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for some input so in a</font>

99
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">nutshell what we're doing is looking at</font>

100
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:46,289
the BGP routing data as collected at<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

101
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,980
monitors in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Abilene backbone for</font>

102
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,780
every router in the backbone so what

103
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,550
those monitors are giving us since

104
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're ibgp monitors are routing</font>

105
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,410
changes experienced by each one of these

106
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,000
routers so that the traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach</font>

107
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,670
in which what you might do if you were

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,020
sort of looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know through</font>

109
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,630
through one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your traditional</font>

110
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:13,320
eyeglasses would be to take one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

111
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:17,909
graphs these are routing updates / /<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

112
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:22,380
minute bin for for the routers in the

113
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:26,160
backbone over the course<font color="#E5E5E5"> of quite some</font>

114
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:29,400
time there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a few problems here to</font>

115
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,770
notice or a few few few things that that

116
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to draw some attention to and and</font>

117
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,599
some of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are well aware of</font>

118
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,969
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want is of course that there's</font>

119
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,500
always noise going on right you can't

120
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,720
say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> when some routing change</font>

121
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,090
happens that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be interesting right</font>

122
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's there's constant churn the other</font>

123
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,070
thing to notice I think is so it's a

124
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,540
little bit hard to see but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

125
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,630
certainly see on the slides posted to

126
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,760
the web to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano website that I've</font>

127
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,520
circled a few examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> of places where</font>

128
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,469
links have failed in the network or so

129
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,960
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something interesting has</font>

130
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,640
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean and one thing to notice</font>

131
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,890
that it's not always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

132
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,630
interesting events correspond with lots

133
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,940
and lots of routing updates particularly

134
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,650
attending any single router right and

135
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,190
and and the converse is also true just

136
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,000
because a big spike of updates happens

137
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,130
doesn't necessarily mean anything

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,050
interesting just happens so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

139
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,880
back to the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of original problem</font>

140
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,390
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know yeah there's lots and</font>

141
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,800
lots of data to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how do we make</font>

142
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,599
sense of it and reduce the level of

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,200
noise so that alarms aren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,310
every minute the key approach we're

145
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,830
looking at here and i think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

146
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to take away in general aside</font>

147
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,258
from you

148
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,219
just looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp data because there</font>

149
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,500
are other<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources that we could</font>

150
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly look at is that if you're just</font>

151
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,039
looking at a single stream of routing

152
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,759
updates or a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> stream of data from</font>

153
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,680
from any one router there's often

154
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,419
limited semantics<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly if you're</font>

155
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,340
looking at routing which we're what

156
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,438
we're getting at here is is moving

157
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,530
beyond just simple reporting of routing

158
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:10,319
up of routing messages that may indicate

159
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:13,258
a problem and really mining mining them

160
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,389
across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network to say extract some</font>

161
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,360
meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example we think based on</font>

162
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:20,669
what's happening that a particular you

163
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,530
know the link may have failed or you

164
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,859
know some type of interesting event may

165
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,138
be occurring so rather than looking at

166
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,139
any single stream we're developing these

167
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,550
techniques that basically look across

168
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:37,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network at all the streams in</font>

169
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:40,139
parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and well why are we doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

170
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,688
because in fact there are dependencies

171
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,340
in these data streams so why not exploit

172
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:45,900
the dependencies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist in these in</font>

173
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,750
these data streams and look at them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

174
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,198
together rather than treating each one

175
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:56,069
of these streams<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data independently</font>

176
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,710
as we know big<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network events</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

177
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,960
may cause some types of correlated blips

178
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,190
right so for example as I've shown in

179
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">these pictures right if you've got a</font>

180
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,849
link failure either internally or

181
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,270
perhaps on appearing session to a

182
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:12,360
neighboring<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s you're going to very</font>

183
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,460
likely see lots of routers change what

184
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,250
they're doing or you know the routes

185
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've chosen for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at you know at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

186
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,029
particular time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you may see all</font>

187
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,310
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes happen right at once right</font>

188
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:25,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's the techniques</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we that</font>

189
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,969
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed are basically geared</font>

190
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,810
towards catching those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of events</font>

191
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:32,279
right lots of routers doing something

192
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,510
doesn't have to be big but if they're

193
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:39,240
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all at once we'll get it this I</font>

194
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,630
think is is only is really kind of a

195
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,240
natural way of looking at network data

196
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,790
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network does have structure</font>

197
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,640
right just looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single routing</font>

198
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,589
stream gives you some information or you

199
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,080
know a single data stream of any kind

200
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,520
gives you some information but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

201
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,130
our dependencies in the network right

202
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,230
the topology the<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration and so</font>

203
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,240
forth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the analysis that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do on</font>

204
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data should be somewhat cognizant of</font>

205
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,740
the dependencies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

206
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,719
topology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have so that's</font>

207
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,130
basically what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to model and</font>

208
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,770
you know use to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more intelligent</font>

209
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:20,970
analysis than sort of simple reporting

210
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:23,370
based on single data streams so the

211
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,770
system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've built basically has</font>

212
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,680
two pieces corresponding to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two</font>

213
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,329
aspects of diagnosis the first is

214
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,400
detection right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're wasted you</font>

215
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,030
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting just</font>

216
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,980
happened the key there of course is

217
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,160
reducing the amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise so that</font>

218
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,780
when you get these detection alarms it's

219
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,199
highly likely that something interesting

220
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:48,060
actually did happen so that's where

221
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,850
we're using ass network-wide analysis of

222
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,560
BGP routing updates and again i do want

223
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,660
to when I when I end with questions I

224
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,869
want to emphasize we are interested in

225
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,699
and and in the process of looking at

226
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,370
other types of data streams as well it

227
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,470
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was one of those incidents of</font>

228
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,580
you know the drunk guy under the

229
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:12,210
lamppost looking for his keys but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

230
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,950
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step is looking looking</font>

231
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,170
at the network wide analysis for

232
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,440
possible disruption events then of

233
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,300
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second step is identification</font>

234
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so we want to know now you've got</font>

235
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:28,079
a you know a bag full of events that may

236
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,510
be interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want to know what</font>

237
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,730
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened right did appearing</font>

238
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,240
session go down did you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> did a link</font>

239
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,520
or a node fail and for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we basically</font>

240
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,240
use some model that we've built of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

241
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,780
network in terms of you know what IP

242
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,850
addresses are<font color="#CCCCCC"> where in terms of routers</font>

243
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,709
within the network IP addresses on

244
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,750
peering sessions and so forth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use</font>

245
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information plus the information</font>

246
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,140
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the routing updates to say</font>

247
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we think you've got a node failure</font>

248
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,930
here or a link failure at this point so

249
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,930
forth

250
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,599
I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about each of those in</font>

251
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,130
sequence so I'll first talk about

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,620
detection how do we figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

253
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,860
interesting is going to happen or just

254
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen i'm sorry i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

255
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,700
into the mechanics basically what we're

256
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,710
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is principal component</font>

257
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,820
analysis which is glorified SVD and if

258
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,410
you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical</font>

259
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,390
details<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a paper and there's a</font>

260
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:30,160
link at the on the last slide to the

261
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:34,449
paper which will be at sigmetrics but

262
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,490
the main idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind the approach is to</font>

263
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,170
start without them any model of what

264
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,300
dependencies exist right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take</font>

265
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,490
all the all the streams of routing data

266
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,880
and then you build a model of what looks

267
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:49,220
normal what<font color="#E5E5E5"> trends look common and based</font>

268
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,439
on those your model of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the common</font>

269
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,800
trends look like you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for deviations</font>

270
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,750
from those trends and the technique the

271
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,339
techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've developed are very</font>

272
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,870
good at extracting deviations where lots

273
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:10,460
of routers experience some kind of

274
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:12,500
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> altogether that looks unusual so</font>

275
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:16,580
we developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technique</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in valuated</font>

276
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,930
on the on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> abilene network another</font>

277
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,360
nice thing we had with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> abilene</font>

278
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">network where if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were to work with</font>

279
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,640
you on problems like these it would be

280
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,620
nice to have was some documented list of

281
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,790
disruptions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we actually knew</font>

282
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:35,930
occurred so they document aw publicly

283
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:41,230
you can go grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yourself all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font>

284
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:43,670
node and<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering like failures and</font>

285
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,000
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only their existence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

286
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,800
type but their location<font color="#E5E5E5"> and duration so</font>

287
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,240
that helped us<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some validation as</font>

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,160
well using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the techniques we developed</font>

289
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,080
we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch everything that</font>

290
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,500
was documented on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

292
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:07,070
going up and down definitely room for

293
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,290
improvement in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failures on</font>

294
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:13,340

295
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:15,139
of those i say acceptable false positive

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:20,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">rates because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

297
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:22,040
hard to tell for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if we</font>

298
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:24,679

301
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,619
didn't happen to know about it or

302
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,749
whether or not you know it in fact is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

303
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:34,579
false positive so again that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

304
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:37,189
place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could certainly improve</font>

305
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:38,419
our techniques by talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people</font>

306
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:41,329
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> running networks who actually</font>

307
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:43,459
have some knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what in fact may</font>

308
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:46,329
or may not have happened rather than

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:51,649
just doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> blackbox post facto</font>

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:55,638
validation they have some reporting

311
00:13:51,649 --> 00:14:01,489
techniques I think again that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> semi</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">automated you might note here that it it</font>

313
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:07,970
does take a fair amount of time in some

314
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:11,989
cases for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys to actually detect</font>

315
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:19,369
and and locate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source of these</font>

316
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:21,019
disruptions as we're developing the the

system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually implements the</font>

318
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:26,629

your mileage may be a little different

321
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:35,350
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely interested to know</font>

322
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:37,160
about that the second piece after

323
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,829
detecting that something interesting

324
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,350
happened is identification<font color="#CCCCCC"> right what</font>

325
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:44,959
just happened and where and there we

326
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">have pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much some simple heuristics</font>

327
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,799
we take the the bag of interesting

328
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:53,509
events and we look again network-wide

329
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,549
for certain types of features in the

330
00:14:53,509 --> 00:15:00,169
beat in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP routing updates streams</font>

331
00:14:55,549 --> 00:15:03,199
for for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the first case</font>

332
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:08,179
there we can look at the set of updates

333
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,799
count the number of ibgp count the

334
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:11,629
number of global next stops that we see

335
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:16,399
in the BGP routing updates in this in

336
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:18,199
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total set of next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hops if that if</font>

337
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,139
that number decreased then it's it's

338
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:23,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">very likely that a node has failed right</font>

339
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:26,779
if no other router in the network is

340
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:29,310
picking a particular node as its egress

341
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,839
then

342
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:34,750
it's likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> that note is no longer there</font>

343
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,339
if not then something else happened and

344
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,920
we have similar types of heuristics by

345
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,320
looking at you know sets of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these next</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">top addresses in the BGP routing updates</font>

347
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:48,790
to figure out exactly what's going on

348
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,069
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to skip this this actually or</font>

349
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,140
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip through it quickly</font>

350
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:56,440
this shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what we detected in</font>

351
00:15:53,140 --> 00:16:00,730
terms of you know events<font color="#E5E5E5"> where nodes and</font>

the method that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we developed you might</font>

359
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,899
note that yes the though the overlap

the size of the set<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we detect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

362
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:35,199

363
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:39,219
still also rather large you'll note that

364
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,880
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not perhaps prohibitively</font>

365
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,610
high that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like two or three</font>

366
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:49,449
alarms per day perhaps but this again

367
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,250
goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point where we had some</font>

368
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:54,040
limitations as far as knowing exactly

369
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,380
what was truly a false positive some of

370
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,390
those 535 may be false positives and

371
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,519
probably are but without actually

372
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,760
knowing what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real interesting</font>

373
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,109
event we it's quite possible that many

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,329
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those actually were something</font>

375
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:11,770
interesting as well we did happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

376
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:14,799
look at those and and note that it did

377
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,750
appear that Lincoln no disruptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

378
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,809
occurring in many of those cases but

379
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,740
without sort of ground truth

380
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:25,389
documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them it's hard to say</font>

381
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,890
for sure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this to the</font>

382
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,049
summary of some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we found I</font>

383
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,570
mean you might sort of wonder first off

384
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,340
the bat why are we looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in BGP could</font>

385
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,960
you even see most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this stuff in BGP</font>

386
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,470
well it turns out most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is</font>

387
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,610
there in some form if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

388
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,559
documented<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptions most of them show</font>

389
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,758
<font color="#CCCCCC">up in the in the ibgp</font>

390
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:48,789
he monitors in some form many of them

391
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,470
are very low volume so that graph I

392
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,970
showed at the beginning where I circled

393
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,240
some things where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there wasn't</font>

394
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:58,690
a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp noise a lot of the</font>

395
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,639
disruptions are of that form so a simple

396
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,039
approach of setting a threshold on a

397
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:06,158
single routing stream is likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

398
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,970
you a lot of noise or miss many of the

399
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:12,879
interesting events or both setting<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

400
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:17,350
such a threshold would be pretty hard

401
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:18,789
because the size of the update spikes if

402
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,070
you will generated by any particular

403
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:26,499
disruption can vary by many or as a

404
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:28,629
magnitude again why I look at the

405
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:32,100
network wide analysis of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these streams</font>

406
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:36,279
well most of these disruptions involve

407
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:39,610
some bgp noise at more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than two routers</font>

408
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:42,039
so that kind of makes sense like for the

409
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,918
reasons I described before the the

410
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:47,049
intuition I gave but it also sort of

411
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,149
argues well you know why not make use of

412
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,009
that somehow in the analysis right if if

413
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:52,779
we know that it's there if the

414
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:55,869
correlation is there we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

415
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:58,749
designing and developing algorithms to

416
00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:03,009
extract that correlation if it's a good

417
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:05,529
indicator of the disruptions<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp routing</font>

418
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:08,019
data works works pretty well other

419
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:11,649
people have tried using bgp update data

420
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:14,799
for for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in the past we</font>

421
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:17,860
think it's it works certainly at least

422
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well as any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those techniques but</font>

423
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">again it's arguable that we should be</font>

424
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:23,980
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> other data and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm open to</font>

425
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:29,110
suggestion there definitely would like

426
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:32,019
to know what you think some numbers for

427
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">you and I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with some some</font>

428

questions actually if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

429
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,428
time to or the desire to step up to them

these<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm very interested to hear how we</font>

433
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:51,279
can take this in future directions and

434
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:52,809
make make this approach more<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

435
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,850
particular I know that there are many

436
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,420
tools out there that that people use

437
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,469
that

438
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">leverage say SNMP or syslog data etc how</font>

439
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy are you with those approaches are</font>

440
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,610
they too noisy are they too hard to

441
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,830
configure to manual you know what types

442
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,629
of network faults are you most

443
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:15,189
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in catching and occur most</font>

444
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:18,940
frequently will<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know where where's</font>

445
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:22,240
the pain point essentially how effective

446
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,880
are these existing tools in terms of you

447
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,320
know reducing the noise level do you

448
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,970
have to go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and manually tweak things</font>

449
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,360
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the noise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

450
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,680
acceptable level is it still too high

451
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,270
are they telling you meaningful things

452
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:39,390
about where the failures are and how to

453
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:41,650
fix them things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd really like to know</font>

454
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:46,120
what about incorporating other types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

455
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:48,670
data so fully aware of SNMP and syslog

456
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,469
and those types of things but what do

457
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,990
folks think about incorporating other

458
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,360
types of measurements like active probes

459
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the network to fergs for use in fast</font>

460
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,830
detection for example everything we've

461
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,260
looked at here is passive but perhaps a

462
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:08,169
combination of approaches may result in

463
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:10,570
less noise or faster detection and yeah

464
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:13,480
most importantly I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

465
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,159
to improve our techniques where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

466
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,550
just the beginning so you can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">look at the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tech report there which</font>

468
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,820
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be revised and up here later later</font>

469
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:26,110
this year at sigmetrics but in the

470
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,560
meanwhile we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely interested</font>

471
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:32,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making this useful so interested to</font>

472
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,399
hear your<font color="#CCCCCC"> thoughts thanks</font>

473
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,870
are there any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions for Nick it</font>

474
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:42,000
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like it one thing i would</font>

475
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:45,959
add nick is on that slide is degree of

476
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,179
fault right so SNMP is fine for letting

477
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,250
us know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's down it</font>

478
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,720
doesn't help you win appear across six

479
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,059
different peers decides to announce

480
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,520
30,000 more routes to you right so

481
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:59,100
there's there's there's applications

482
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,559
there where this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is helpful cool all</font>

483
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so no more emotions got 10 think</font>

484
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,399
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a seat all right</font>

485
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,399
