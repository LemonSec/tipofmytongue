00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,620
hello can you hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> me so good morning my</font>

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,790
name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> stefan suru yo I'm faculty at</font>

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,429
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of Toronto in the</font>

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,989
computer science department university

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,830
of toronto is just a couple of blocks

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,359
north of here so unlike most of you who

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,770
get to only spend about three days of

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,670
winter in<font color="#E5E5E5"> toronto i get to spend the</font>

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,990
entire winter every year<font color="#E5E5E5"> one good things</font>

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,730
about research talks is that there are

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,139
15 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> only so hopefully they're</font>

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,080
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> short and sweet so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well before I begin</font>

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,989
I want to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit of a</font>

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,760
very high level view of the research

16
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,680
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm doing this is joint</font>

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,710
work with Troy Rhonda with my graduate

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,860
student so what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying</font>

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,140
to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prevalence of certain</font>

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,000
internet security attacks in particular

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,039
you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> when people receive</font>

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">phishing emails as spam emails and half</font>

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do people really click on the links</font>

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,590
in their emails why does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

25
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing still happens and why do people</font>

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,899
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel forms and online and buy</font>

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,039
viagra and so forth so to do that we

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,899
said we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to trace a network</font>

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,210
traffic at the University of Toronto now

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,400
in research Rana<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a large school it</font>

31
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,380
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> three campuses the campus downtown</font>

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,030
which is the one here if you go on in

33
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,560
verse 11 you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the campus is</font>

34
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,600
called the st. George campus and it's

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,920
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is a campus on the</font>

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,509
east side of the city and there is a

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,950
campus on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> west side of the city the</font>

38
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,619
one on the west is called University of

39
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,150
Toronto Mississauga and we are tracing

40
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,530
all the traffic going in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

41
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,840
campus University of Toronto Mississauga

42
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,060
so in this talk I'm going to just tell

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">you about what are some of the concerns</font>

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,950
that we had to deal with in order to

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,780
protect the users privacy when we trace

46
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,720
network traffic so just kind of to take

47
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,189
a step back about eight months ago unit

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,200
we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to University of Toronto and we</font>

49
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,398
said to the ethics comedian we said we'd

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,720
like to actually look at everyone's

51
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,610
emails and they said no so it took<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

52
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,590
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight months to kind of convince</font>

53
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,780
them that we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to offer some</font>

54
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,579
privacy guarantees and the role of this

55
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,229
talk is to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what we've learned</font>

56
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now one thing I want to I want to</font>

57
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,350
give a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of motivation so a lot</font>

58
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,129
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are doing network</font>

59
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,599
tracing and today in today's day and age

60
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,840
all these networks racing in order to be

61
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,730
in

62
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to you have to look at</font>

63
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,690
packet payload a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people talk</font>

64
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">about packet headers collecting them</font>

65
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,440
analyzing them understanding what's

66
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,489
going on that's great but all the good

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,440
stuff and the interesting stuff

68
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,090
especially from a security standpoint or

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,950
cursing the packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> payloads not in the</font>

70
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,500
headers anymore now when the moment you

71
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,079
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at packet payloads now the</font>

72
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,720
privacy concerns<font color="#E5E5E5"> escalates right because</font>

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're looking at people's traffic and</font>

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,500
typically when you look at the research

75
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,510
projects and how they deal with privacy

76
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,940
they pretty much all of them deal with

77
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,798
what I call a three-step process let's

78
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,650
gather data we're going to write it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

79
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,420
the disk then offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time later</font>

80
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,799
we're going to anonymize it and the way

81
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,480
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anonymize it is using a</font>

82
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,640
hash function and there's a whole bunch

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">of very smart hash functions some of</font>

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,440
them are what what's called prefix

85
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,269
preserving in other words if you have to

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,340
IP addresses that share the first two

87
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,290
octaves even<font color="#CCCCCC"> after you uh naanum eyes</font>

88
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,730
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> the anonymize numbers the hash</font>

89
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,099
values are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share the first two</font>

90
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,929
octaves and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice and finally</font>

91
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,869
after we analyze the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire day that</font>

92
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,739
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away the raw data</font>

93
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,170
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the entire</font>

94
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,940
analysis on the anonymous traces and

95
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,679
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

96
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,760
disseminate our faces<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the research</font>

97
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,109
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to post these</font>

98
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,730
faces online on a public website

99
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,380
somewhere for people to download them

100
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,030
and run their own studies because that's

101
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,319
very nice we get a lot of citations that

102
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,730
way ok now the message of my talk today

103
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,078
if there is one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like you to</font>

104
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,880
remember is that these three step

105
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,920
process is completely inadequate from a

106
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,359
privacy standpoint you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with a</font>

107
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,950
straight face in front of an ethics

108
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:45,180
committee and say oh we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

109
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,560
gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the raw data is three</font>

110
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,290
somewhere on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk and sometime in</font>

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future going to remember to erase it</font>

112
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,260
that doesn't work especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font>

113
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">start talking to people telling people</font>

114
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,149
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at their emails</font>

115
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:59,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so why is that now for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next two</font>

116
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,849
slides I'm going to give you a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

117
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:04,888
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could actually be mounted</font>

118
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:07,709
against your traces and can expose a lot

119
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,480
of privacy first of all I was called

120
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,209
mapping attacks now mapping attacks

121
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually map from anonymized data back</font>

122
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,989
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the road data and there are two types</font>

123
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">of magic mapping attacks there are known</font>

124
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,220
mapping attacks and there are inferred

125
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,988
mapping attacks now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean on</font>

126
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,000
mapping attack so let's suppose<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

127
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the president of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the university's</font>

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,889
IP address doesn't share any pre

129
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,989
nobody no other IP address within the

130
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:32,210
university<font color="#E5E5E5"> of toronto now even if you</font>

131
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,830
wanna minimize that IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

132
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that on my straits you can figure</font>

133
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,520
out the IP address of the of the

134
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,919
president<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the university that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

135
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,690
the second one are inferred mapping

136
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,400
attacks inferred basically means you

137
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,259
don't really have knowledge but you can

138
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,599
make educated guesses so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you</font>

139
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:51,229
an example if you if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

140
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,750
10 most popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay most popular</font>

141
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:54,979
websites in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace yes there are not</font>

142
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,570
in my so you don't know what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

143
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,630
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take some educated guesses</font>

144
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,729
so for example chances are google com is

145
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,620
one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then you can try to</font>

146
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:05,449
break the keys of the hashing functions

147
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,729
that way let me give you a different

148
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,139
interesting example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll work up a</font>

149
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,960
peer-to-peer traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you suddenly</font>

150
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,250
see that on<font color="#CCCCCC"> november 30 2006 suddenly</font>

151
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,900
there is this new file<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you've</font>

152
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen before you don't know the</font>

153
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,440
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only mais but it's very</font>

154
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,419
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look actually</font>

155
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">on IMDb and you realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

156
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,620
same date when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> borod movie is being</font>

157
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,880
released<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can say hi i think</font>

158
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can take a pretty good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as to</font>

159
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,979
what that file actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is okay and</font>

160
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,410
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that third type of attack is</font>

161
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,300
data injection attacks so on attacker

162
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,060
knows that you're tracing and it

163
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,979
basically construct traffic you know

164
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,270
carefully in a careful manner and it

165
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:43,430
tries to inject this traffic in your

166
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">face then it goes online you download</font>

167
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,270
your trace and it tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

168
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,729
those carefully constructed patterns in

169
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hash trace and it can learn a</font>

170
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,719
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way as well they're</font>

171
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,460
also crypto attacks playing all crypto

172
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,810
attacks whenever you talk to a crypto

173
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,270
guy he<font color="#E5E5E5"> will tell you are you remember</font>

174
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,949
that md5 hash function I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can generate</font>

175
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,810
collisions in about eight hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my</font>

176
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,699
laptop really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

177
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,199
collisions are not particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad when</font>

178
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,599
you trace and when you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> non mais</font>

179
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,070
things the real question in my mind is

180
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment you make these trace is</font>

181
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,610
available yes they're going to be hard

182
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be breakable from a crypto point of</font>

183
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,510
view today but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are they</font>

184
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,239
going to be are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they going to be able to</font>

185
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,460
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken 20 30 years from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now very very</font>

186
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,659
easily because if they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

187
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,409
like to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know two years</font>

188
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">from now everybody can read their email</font>

189
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:30,740
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> even more attacks and on this</font>

190
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,659
slide I have what I consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> the war</font>

191
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,190
mode the worst<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack the most worrisome</font>

192
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,260
their attacks on the tracing

193
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,270
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> your have a machine that</font>

194
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,710
looks at all the traffic online and it

195
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,849
has access to it

196
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,380
how do you know that I'm machine is

197
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,990
gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be remotely</font>

198
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,480
exploitable some guy somewhere is going

199
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,760
to actually hack into your machine there

200
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,920
are also unanticipated attacks we can

201
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,360
just not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to foresee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

202
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,610
attack somebody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

203
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,440
mount on these traces and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

204
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,480
that I like to give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of week</font>

205
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,130
uppal of years ago somebody show that is

206
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,890
very easy to fingerprint the operating

207
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,870
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a host by looking at the</font>

208
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,849
timings of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular packets in</font>

209
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,500
the TCP streams there are all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

210
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,970
clever ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually attack that you</font>

211
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,610
can really foresee so that you can

212
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,530
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself against</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

213
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,960
finally the worst one in my mind is what

214
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,340
I call legal complications some smart

215
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,169
lawyers somewhere thinks that it's a

216
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,109
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to get his hands on your trace</font>

217
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,670
and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> penis and we're a publicly</font>

218
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,040
funded research group<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the public</font>

219
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,630
institution will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have so if</font>

220
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,160
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> subpoena to actually you know</font>

221
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,440
give access to our tracing

222
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,450
infrastructure and if you have raw data

223
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,850
on the tracing infrastructure and that's

224
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and let me tell you why</font>

225
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,120
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried about this isn't that</font>

226
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,920
all these attacks that I presented so

227
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,590
far if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could reveal some</font>

228
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,630
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

229
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have access to the raw data you</font>

230
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,100
revealed whole identities actually then

231
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,300
powerful information of all the users

232
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,060
whose traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're monitoring and</font>

233
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,070
that's particularly bad so we scratch

234
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,510
our head and we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we learn two</font>

235
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,490
things they're here two things we're not

236
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,010
going to do first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we're not going</font>

237
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:08,630
to write plain text or raw data to the

238
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:10,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">disk ever okay because like I said you</font>

239
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,900
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually if somebody gets their</font>

240
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,610
hands on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data you can get</font>

241
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,409
subpoenaed well you're right running it

242
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't write it and you haven't</font>

243
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,250
erased it yet and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very</font>

244
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,530
serious attack because it reveals<font color="#CCCCCC"> fully</font>

245
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about the identities of the</font>

246
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,969
people who are tracing and the second

247
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,500
thing we actually learned and we decided

248
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">not to do we said we're not going to</font>

249
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,790
make these traces publicly available

250
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,930
we're not going to post them online if

251
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,970
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other researchers that have</font>

252
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,319
interesting questions or studies or

253
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,360
queries they would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> run our</font>

254
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,830
traces will be happy to accommodate them

255
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,270
we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make these things</font>

256
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,250
available somewhere online so that

257
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,170
people can download<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and archive</font>

258
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,650
them and break them 30 40 years from now

259
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,870
or anything like that okay so um how are

260
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,030
we how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm</font>

261
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,620
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually give you a picture here</font>

262
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,900
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

263
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,810
mental model of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing now in</font>

264
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this slide you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three clouds on the</font>

265
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,319
left you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the Internet cloud in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

266
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,150
middle you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the main cloud which is</font>

267
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,950
the st. George campus the biggest campus

268
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">in University of Toronto and on the</font>

269
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,690
right you have the campus at mississauga

270
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:13,029
which is the one we trace traffic to and

271
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,850
from there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things i wanna say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

272
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,290
this slide first of all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mississauga</font>

273
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,029
the campus at mississauga is connected

274
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,140
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet via saying George okay</font>

275
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,450
so it has it doesn't have its own

276
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,550
connection and second and the most

277
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,620
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture is</font>

278
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">not up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scale when I'm not claiming</font>

279
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,920
hear that university of toronto is as

280
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,600
big as the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of traffic</font>

281
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,849
or anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just</font>

282
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">making these clouds big enough so that</font>

283
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,000
we understand what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on of course</font>

284
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is much much bigger than</font>

285
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,589
the traffic we're looking on here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

286
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,420
so what is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing well we have</font>

287
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,070
a switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the link from Mississauga to</font>

288
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,709
st. George and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does port mirroring</font>

289
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it has a one-way linking to our</font>

290
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,750
tracing machine now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dotted frame you</font>

291
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,790
see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide that's one machine and</font>

292
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,980
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically split</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it into ram or</font>

293
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,839
volatile memory and stable memory or

294
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,820
stable storage and that's 13<font color="#E5E5E5"> C machine</font>

295
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,620
and we have a one way link what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

296
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,420
mean to have a one way link well you

297
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,520
take basically a fiber cable which has

298
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,150
an impound inbound and outbound channel

299
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,650
and we only only put the inbound channel

300
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,319
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Machine and we do not connect</font>

301
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,730
the outbound channel in other words we

302
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,560
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is absolutely no</font>

303
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,839
wire or fiber optic cable or anything

304
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,849
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can take packets and</font>

305
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,250
route them send them outside of this

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine we basically disconnect our</font>

tracing machine from the internet

308
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,410
because to my knowledge this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

309
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,029
way we can go in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Ethics</font>

remotely into this machine over the

313
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,390
Internet there is no wire coming out of

314
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:41,589
this machine okay okay so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

315
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing well we're getting</font>

316
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">packets on this one way link and we're</font>

317
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,490
basically doing everything in around

318
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,410
there is no kind of you know secret

319
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,820
sauce here it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like bad news in</font>

320
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,740
some sense so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing we're</font>

321
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,410
capturing the packets online we're doing

322
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,300
TCP reconstruction HTTP reconstruction

323
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,740
we're doing more application level<font color="#CCCCCC"> equal</font>

324
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,290
construction in particular we're looking

325
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,850
at hotmail mail that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually</font>

326
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,130
receive with hotmail and gmail and

327
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,270
things like that we also run<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam</font>

328
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">assassin</font>

329
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,020
and we do everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> in RAM and then</font>

330
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,970
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we're done we are naanum eyes</font>

331
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,090
the data and then we write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a stable</font>

332
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,280
storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what does this mean this</font>

333
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,440
has these nice property which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you</font>

334
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,930
unplug the machine from power all that

335
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,240
thing is gone because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in volatile</font>

336
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,189
memory so if you get the peanut and I've

337
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,380
unplug this machine from<font color="#E5E5E5"> power there is</font>

338
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,140
no raw data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this machine whatsoever</font>

339
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might wonder how do you</font>

340
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,620
know there is really no raw data what

341
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,660
about the swap file right i mean you can

342
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,820
get and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we're</font>

343
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to disable swap file but the kind</font>

344
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the good news is you know if you're</font>

345
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,010
tracing a line spins and if you start

346
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,410
swapping things in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of memory</font>

347
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,240
you're probably too slow anyway and you

348
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,969
lost so you should crash rather than

349
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,820
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we're starting we're</font>

350
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,020
writing everything to stable storage

351
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically our answer and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

352
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,260
how we reveal we're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> after eight</font>

353
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,150
months of discussions with the ethics

354
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,580
community to get to be approved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

355
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,880
actually look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> webmail</font>

356
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,470
for for fishing so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> summary our</font>

357
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,060
infrastructure protects against

358
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,650
intrusion attacks and the way it does

359
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is because it's disconnected from</font>

360
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,310
the internet there is no traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

361
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,020
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this machine it protects against</font>

362
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,479
legal attacks to recover raw data

363
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,970
because all the raw data manipulation is

364
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,650
done in volatile memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM and it</font>

365
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,630
protects against mapping crypto on

366
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,890
anticipating the data injection attacks

367
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,070
because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make this</font>

368
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,600
trace is publicly available however the

369
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,220
inside here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that some of these</font>

370
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,830
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the mapping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> creeps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

371
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,600
anticipated attacks are still<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

372
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,520
if somebody gets their hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

373
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,140
anonymous traced one way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

374
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,270
to be subpoenaed and we really don't

375
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,520
know very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well how to protect against</font>

376
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,890
that other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than saying that you know</font>

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,840
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymize traces will make</font>

378
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,850
sure to permanently destroy them as

379
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,490
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we can and that's our best</font>

380
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,170
answer so far now I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is my</font>

381
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,940
summary slide I have one more kind of

382
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,189
it's kind of like the lamest sliding the

383
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,680
whole talk and this is kind of like some

384
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,760
preliminary statistics about fishing the

385
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,109
reason why these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very</font>

386
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">preliminary is that we're basically</font>

387
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,370
tracing as we speak like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we do a</font>

388
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,229
lot of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ram our tracing</font>

389
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,450
infrastructure is really not<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock-solid</font>

390
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,790
the longest race we've collected so far

391
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,650
is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 56 hours okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because after</font>

392
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we crashed because of all kinds of</font>

393
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,579
bad bugs and things like that we do

394
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything in RAM so only tracing about</font>

395
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,690
honey megabits per second this was the

396
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,980
traffic over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the weekend coming in and</font>

397
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of this campus we could probably</font>

398
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,190
trace up to about the gigabit per second

399
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,720
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine we have so far but</font>

400
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's this is a smaller campus and it</font>

401
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,940
has a only about five thousand users now

402
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,819
we look at hotmail for now only<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

403
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,310
we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people 200 people using</font>

404
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,260
hotmail and they have read so these

405
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,479
slices we see but they have read is not

406
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,580
received they clicked on their emails or

407
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">700 times so they've read about 700</font>

408
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,230
unique messages and about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3% of them are</font>

409
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,760
spam seems pretty low the reason why

410
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,140
it's low is because hotmail does a

411
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,750
fairly good job of filtering and

412
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,030
classifying email as spam as well so we

413
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,520
this is Pam after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has escaped the</font>

414
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,470
hotmail filters another statistic that I

415
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,710
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of finish with kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font>

416
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,910
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know that I found very</font>

417
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,130
interesting this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again very</font>

418
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,900
preliminary so I did not put this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

419
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,520
slide because you know take this with a

420
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,410
grain of salt<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's an interesting</font>

421
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,569
thing we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I found very kind of</font>

422
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,670
counterintuitive it turns out that if

423
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at clean emails emails that are</font>

424
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,140
not spam many of them don't have links

425
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,090
that's great but but many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them do</font>

426
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,280
have links and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting thing is</font>

427
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the number of links in clean emails</font>

428
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,050
is actually higher than the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

429
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,420
links in spam emails or phishing emails

430
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,949
and we believe that the reason of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

431
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,900
this is treats<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the bad guys</font>

432
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make you click on a</font>

433
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,260
single link they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna give you</font>

434
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,850
too many links and options you can click

435
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,470
on because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good did we want</font>

436
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on this link as if you click</font>

437
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,910
there then good things happen to them

438
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,920
and bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> things happen to you and that's</font>

439
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of my my talk I you know this</font>

440
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,069
this code that we're actually developing

441
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,780
is going to be and it is actually

442
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,640
publicly available and open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

443
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,199
so forth so you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> download a</font>

444
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,380
copy and play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it thank you very</font>

445
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,380
much

446
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,750
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the next presenter come up</font>

447
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:24,589
here while I ask if there are any

448
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:28,490
questions Joel yay glee I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

449
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:30,620
observation if you actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc or</font>

450
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:38,959
swap it's it it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

451
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:41,269
generate random key every time and have

452
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,920
temp or swap file systems that are

453
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,290
encrypted so that every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the</font>

454
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,750
machinery boots you get new file systems

455
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite convenient and</font>

456
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:53,899
we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in some collectors that's</font>

457
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,630
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will actually looked at that</font>

458
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,069
also and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a good solution as</font>

459
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,899
well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be probably be done</font>

460
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:01,189
the thing that I'm worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I'm</font>

461
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,199
worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's being swapped and</font>

462
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,550
what's not being swapped what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

463
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the key that i have in</font>

464
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">RAM is not going to be soft on discover</font>

465
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,230
but you're right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

466
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,380
nice solution i'm not saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

467
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,910
yeah right well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if you want to</font>

468
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to me about it later shut around</font>

469
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:20,149
wonderful thank you yes sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> mike hughes</font>

470
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:23,269
links um thanks Stefan it was me who

471
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:24,829
press can give into doing this just one

472
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,990
another question was the machine that

473
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:28,969
you're using at the moment um how much

474
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,680
memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> here physical RAM and how much</font>

475
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,509
storage have you got on the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

476
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,849
machine so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have only four gig of ram</font>

477
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:37,579
and here is one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of learned</font>

478
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,959
doing this is that you know having more

479
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">rameez nice there is nothing wrong with</font>

480
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,479
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the reason why you're running out</font>

481
00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:44,360
of RAM is because you probably have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

482
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,220
memory leak somewhere and if you have

483
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,660
eight gig instead of four gig of 12

484
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,069
games of the four gig rather than

485
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,480
tracing for three days<font color="#E5E5E5"> your trace you're</font>

486
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:52,069
going to be tracing for five days or

487
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
something like that so we're better off

488
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:56,180
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go after that bug and try to</font>

489
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,649
fix it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's quite a useful</font>

490
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,029
point because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I mean we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

491
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,500
doing some work with things like s flow

492
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,600
data and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

493
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,039
is trying to handle this much stuff and

494
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,809
it you're always doing things in RAM

495
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:07,849
disk and then having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to commit stuff</font>

496
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,959
later and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make the</font>

497
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,270
thing fast enough because you've got so

498
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,220
many Mac to Mac pairs for example in my

499
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">application but that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really but</font>

500
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,880
you're right the biggest bottleneck we

501
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,549
have is RAM and the second biggest

502
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,140
bottleneck is CPU storage is not really

503
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:25,079
an issue

504
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,079
okay thank you thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>
