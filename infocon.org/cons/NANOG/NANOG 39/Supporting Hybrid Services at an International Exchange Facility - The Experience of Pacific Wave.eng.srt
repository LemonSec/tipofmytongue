okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm David maga with the Pacific</font>

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:10,340
Northwest Giga pop today I'll be talking

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,899
about Pacific wave and our foray into

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,500
hybrid exchange services<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got a few</font>

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,640
new terms that I'll be introducing

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,520
pretty common in the research and

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,109
education community might be new for

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,859
some of some folks that aren't that's

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,680
closely involved so real quick about

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pacific wave it's a joint project</font>

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,030
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporation for education</font>

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,800
network initiatives in California some

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,200
folks know its Enoch and the Pacific

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,078
Northwest Giga pop in cooperation with

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,850
USC and University of Washington<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

and then jumbo frames in any combination

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:02,640
there so some of the initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> pacific</font>

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,769
wave services are<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty traditional to</font>

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,590

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,700
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opening infrastructure for connecting</font>

26

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,490
primary focus across the Pacific Rim

28
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,030
facilitate any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Danny connectivity</font>

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,439
between the connectors and then we are

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,479
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this without extra</font>

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,729
involvement of the exchange operators

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,350
with the shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans and I've got a</font>

that and then we do have private vlans

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,990
that we can provision for participants

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,360
on an as-needed basis so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

throughout the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asiapac region and</font>

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,649
those connectors come in at anywhere

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,399
from OC 3 speeds to 10 gigs or multiple

45
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">kincaid connections and then also</font>

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,920
provide kind of a meet point for the

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,080
researchers genetic research and

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,030
education networks in the US and

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,099
connectivity into canada and latin

50
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:20,830
america that was added fairly recently

51
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,810
so some of the characteristics again the

52
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,590
distributed connectivity with the shared

53
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,480
broadcast domains with the shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans</font>

54
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,700
what we have a pretty strict connector

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,119
policy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that nothing strange</font>

56
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,730
happens on the VLAN so we restrict

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,430
single MAC address / VLAN with port

58
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,069
security have a policy of not allowing

59
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,280
connectors to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than</font>

60
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:49,420
connect layer 3 devices directly and do

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,840
things like spanning tree root guard so

62
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,458
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a diagram of the shared VLAN</font>

63
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,950
infrastructure so basically there's a

64
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,709
notion of local<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans in the nurse a</font>

65
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,959
VLAN so the inner sight<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans are where</font>

66
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,269
connectors in the same geographic region

67
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,700
connect so for example to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Seattle</font>

68
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,670
participants might appear across the

local<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then if a Seattle</font>

71
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,548
to connect to each other than they would

72
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,340
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear across the inner side</font>

73
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:22,600
shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs and then take all those and</font>

74
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:25,060
overlay that with a jumbo MTU variety to

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,680
allow jumbo peering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's given the</font>

76
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:31,690
research and education focus we have a

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,959
pretty big focus concentration on the

78
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">jumbo empty use and I would say that</font>

79
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,410
probably the majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parents</font>

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:43,090
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> take place across specific wave are</font>

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,240
peering services and some of the the

<font color="#CCCCCC">is one name for it and so basically the</font>

105
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,360
idea of being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have these light</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on the next slide so these light paths</font>

that allow researchers labs to

private vlans that that we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

139
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,260
create we just put up basically for the

<font color="#E5E5E5">conference and then torn back down so</font>

141
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,349
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got us in the habit of this</font>

142
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:33,310
is this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of services that</font>

that we can provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for kind of some of</font>

the non-traditional connectivity needs

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,700
for for the

146
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,380
searchers so kind of got us<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking on</font>

147
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:48,390
how how we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of start to do this</font>

148
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,969
more often in a more scalable fashion so

00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,560
light<font color="#CCCCCC"> path is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the pretty common</font>

151
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,510

152
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,180
basically defines a more or less<font color="#CCCCCC"> a layer</font>

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 connection from one point to another</font>

154
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,030
no routers in between doesn't

155
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,360
necessarily define the protocol which

156
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,000
underlies it so in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases where</font>

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,970
in other cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 10 gig</font>

lambda over a WDM system or another

161
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,920
thing that's quite common now is that

162
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,440
the community is pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed upon</font>

the the connectivity so we had one

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,240
straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> down into the San Diego</font>

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,610
then all the international connectivity

there for some super high def stuff they

were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so some of the administrative</font>

195
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,870
leaps that we've had to make from being

196
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:09,520
a traditional exchange facility to a

197
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:12,010
hybrid exchange is perhaps relaxing some

198
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,750
of the connector policy so if we're

199
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,550
carrying these layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domains from</font>

200
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,370
basically around the globe then

201
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,870
obviously the the policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says that</font>

202
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,520
you can't connect directly or two

203
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,430
devices doesn't it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't really work</font>

204
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of situation so deciding</font>

205
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,770
how to handle that the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

206
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing the private vlans and not</font>

207
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,579
relying on on everything for a shared

208
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">VLANs and then we use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the exchange</font>

209
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,120
operators after acted a little bit more

210
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,680
quickly perhaps to some of the

211
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,000
provisioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests for the private</font>

212
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,719
vlans and things like that because some

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the demos and experiments that some</font>

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> researchers doing have a little</font>

215
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,089
bit less advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> warning and then</font>

216
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't done anything with this yet but</font>

217
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,650
whether there's additional building

218
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,209
models it should be considered so right

219
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,630
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> villa models are fairly</font>

220
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,190
similar to all the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanges</font>

221
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:07,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're familiar with today whereby</font>

222
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:09,089
you basically paid for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> port fee and</font>

223
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,589
do whatever with the port you choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

move as much traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the desi</font>

225
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:19,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">cheese so technically though again</font>

226
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,130
definitely seeing an increase use of the

227
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,410
private VLAN so that we can basically

228
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,740
provide a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indian connection or</font>

229
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,480
light path through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch fabric</font>

230
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,950
that may originate on one side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

231
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,400
globe and end up on another<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of the</font>

232
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,560
globe and then less controls over what

233
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,300
types of devices so we may see a

234
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,000
connector come in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> another layer to</font>

235
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,939
switch we may see them come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in with with</font>

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the l2vpn over there layer 3 network or</font>

237
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,820
may come in over like a WDM lambda<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

238
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,100
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the other</font>

239
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that we that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely been a</font>

240
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,450
challenge as when we're connecting the

00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,440
native layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 devices is trying to</font>

242
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:03,680
to avoid vlan-id collision so like right

243
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,560
now today we have probably three fairly

244
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,949
permanent connections to other layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

245
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks so what we've had to do those</font>

246
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,950
ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we know that we</font>

247
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,500
connect to regularly we've been able to

248
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of set aside vlan-id space that we</font>

249
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,750
know doesn't overlap with each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

250
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,510
we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

251
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,820

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be any issues but as we can</font>

253
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
have change these layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two domains</font>

254
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,960
together and it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a</font>

255
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:36,230
challenge because it may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

256
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,060
of the the VLAN ID space<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the two</font>

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pacific wave and perhaps another</font>

258
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,790
exchange have agreed upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> may may not</font>

259
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:49,490
overlap with with you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next top</font>

260
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:52,250
of the layer two domains so some of the

261
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,500
realities<font color="#CCCCCC"> life has are not provided and</font>

262
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,380
not provided by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same end end</font>

263
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology so ideally in some cases if</font>

264
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the researcher has the need for some</font>

265
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,180
sort of layer 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> GF PF mapped frame map</font>

266
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,370

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,089

268
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:13,850
end is can be pretty pretty challenging

269
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:17,330
sometimes so in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases you may have</font>

270
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,340
a what starts out as a GF<font color="#E5E5E5"> PF free map</font>

271
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,190
service goes in comes out of the

272
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,160
researchers lab goes into a traditional

273
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,560
layer to network maybe across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MPS</font>

274
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">domain and then back out to a another</font>

275
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,359
traditional layer to network so one of

276
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,959
the things as an exchange hybrid

277
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,760
exchange operator that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are trying to</font>

278
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,610
fill as kind of act as in some cases

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> translation point so if we have all</font>

280
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,650
the different devices in the toolkit

281
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,520
then we can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that interconnect</font>

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:51,620
between the networks as necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,390
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one infrastructure</font>

that we that were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offer in</font>

285
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,990
Seattle we've got a nortel HDFC that we

<font color="#E5E5E5">like no stat boxing obviously when</font>

335
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,920
we're talking about 10 gigabit light

336

338
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:29,769
or not so the switch Ethernet provides

339
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,720
us the ability for example if a

340
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,829

or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

342
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:38,170
provide them a 10 gig handoff but still

343
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">not have to burn up an entire 10 gigs</font>

344
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,779

345
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,089
when we're talking about framer or

346
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,820
packet based networks and we may end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional concerns for frame loss</font>

348
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,329
on when when we're running congested

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,639
links or back lanes or anything like

350
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:56,800
that and then there's a bit of debate

351
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,649
whether you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether this is truly a</font>

352
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,620
light path because one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things the</font>

353
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:05,470
light path that defines is something

354
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,699
that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> predictable has very</font>

predictable performance characteristics

356
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:13,029
so again one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that as a</font>

357
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,699
hybrid exchange operator we're providing

00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:17,459
care of that layer 1 and layer to

359

360
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,060
traditional core services of providing a

fabric for the layer three networks

362
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,880

optical like white light switches that

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to connect the boxes</font>

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,800
fullness<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time be able to control all</font>

372
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,410
those via some sort of control plane

policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> a protocol like GM POS or</font>

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,110
something like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's actually</font>

375
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of work being done in the</font>

376
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,490
community with those sort of things and

377
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually some energy inter-domain</font>

378
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:08,319
controls for some of the GMP<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss</font>

379
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:10,119
networks so when we have researchers

380
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,970
that that are asking for light<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths</font>

381
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,619
some of the technology choices that are

382
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">taken in consideration or what other</font>

383
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:20,889
performance requirements their bandwidth

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,929
requirements and time frame that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

385
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,270
need the service activated so in some

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases we can provide for example</font>

387
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,860
switched<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet a lot faster</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

the availability the wide area transport

391
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,590
so especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> going across the Pacific</font>

392
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:44,190
we may only have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

393
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:46,260
configured as a as a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 offering</font>

394
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,660
and it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty difficult or</font>

395
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:53,940
service interrupting to reconfigure that

396
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,799
so Pacific waves involvement left so

397
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,140
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pretty common term in there</font>

398
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,809
are any community but probably a new one

399
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,610
here so glyph is the global lambda

400
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:04,290
integrated facility I've got some URLs

401
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,659
at the end that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually read a</font>

402
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,840
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this stuff</font>

403
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:12,179
so the whole idea here is that it

404
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,549
provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the ability to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

405
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,580
these light paths from one lab to

406
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:21,418
another on kind of a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale and</font>

407
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,770
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually it still takes a in</font>

408
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,650
order to put some of these pretty

409
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,780
complex lighthouse together the the way

410
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,809
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done today is by a pretty</font>

411
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:33,418
long email thread but it actually works

412
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,220
pretty well once once everything's put

413
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,330
together and it's it's not uncommon to

414
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,650
find these light paths these layer two

415
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,149
connections that stretch from literally

416
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:46,230
one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the globe to another through</font>

417
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:48,870
various goals so the goal Pacific wave

418
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,790
is a goal this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> glyph open light</font>

419
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,729
path exchange so it's basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

420
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:55,710
of an exchange point specifically for

421
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,340
interconnecting these light paths some

422
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:01,440
other examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goals that are part of</font>

427
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,160
the things that pacific wave does is it

428
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,659
kind of introduces this term of the

429
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,700
distributed goal so as I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

mentioned before that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific wave</font>

431
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,570
is a distributed exchange point that

432
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,470
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of provides the any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNA</font>

433
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:31,260
connectivity regardless of which nodes

434
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:33,330
participant connects at so we're kind of

435
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:38,879
attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that with the with the</font>

436
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:41,350
light path exchange as well so being a

437
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,419
distributed goal some of our properties

438
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">are that we're able to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

the any day any connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol translation in some cases so</font>

441
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,480
have that the different technologies in

442
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,950
our toolkit at all the locations up and

443
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,990
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific wave and then the other</font>

445
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,690
administrative standpoint as we see

446
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:07,418
physical wave as a as a single entity so

447
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,830
we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to deal with participants</font>

448
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:10,330
that connect to the exchange as as

449
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,299
though we're a single entity even though

450
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,039
we kind of cooperate the devices between

451
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:18,520
scenic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Pacific Northwest give you</font>

452
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,690
pop and then ideally what we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

453
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,549
be able to say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have no</font>

454
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:25,720
bandwidth limitations between nodes so

455
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:27,760
if you can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the if if</font>

457
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,960
in a single location then will you be

458
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:35,049
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide the connectivity between</font>

459
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,820
all the various equipment so long as

460
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:39,280
there are reports available in fiber and

461
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to do that</font>

across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wide area and of course this</font>

463
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:47,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">is within reason we we do have a pretty</font>

00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">good access to 10 gigabit lambdas up and</font>

465
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,140
down the west coast but there at some

466
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:55,960
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do run out so now we try and</font>

467
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:00,490
use those in as intelligent manner as

468
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:03,220
possible so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

469
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,890
glyph tries to do is actually define a

kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of representing</font>

connectivity between the various goals

472
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:11,710
and this is the this what you see here

473
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">these the idea of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> circles and</font>

474
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,510

475
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,340
version of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as you can see they</font>

476
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:21,760
the pacific way that the various points

<font color="#CCCCCC">ask connectivity to the keralite the</font>

479
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:31,270
Hong Kong connectivity as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

480
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,539
through Hawaii to our net and then

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:37,299
connectivity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> manland in in New York</font>

482
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:42,750
and actually fairly robust connectivity

483
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:44,889
to starlight in Chicago so some of the

484
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,980
future technologies that we're looking

485
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">at today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific waves the traditional</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we've been looking at the future though</font>

490
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:04,668
or more complex<font color="#CCCCCC"> wide area topology so</font>

491
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:07,250
you know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can provide some</font>

492
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:08,480
redundancy other than that single

493
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,389
connection that runs up and down the

494
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,460
west coast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

495
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:17,389
some sort of additional bandwidth

496
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,679
management then things like mpls layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

497
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:21,620
VPNs become a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

498
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:25,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting to provide let everything</font>

499
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:28,189
run underlying on a layer 3 network to

500
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:30,320
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more control over if</font>

501
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,870
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like rsvp-te or something</font>

502
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,668
like that to control the actual pathing

503
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,590
of the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two connections and then</font>

504
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:40,309
have some sort of redundancy between

505
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:47,750
there and then also optical switching

506
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:50,210
between the connections and then some of

507
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,870
the other upcoming technologies that

508
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,909
we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of keeping an eye on GF PF 10</font>

509
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,850
gige land by so basically the notion

510
00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:00,230
here is potentially be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font>

511
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,209
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're doing with Giggy</font>

512
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,070
so for example it's not uncommon for us

513
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,470
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to provide a giggi that's in</font>

514
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:09,049
fact mapped over like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 622 big time</font>

515
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,059
slot if we could provide a 10 gige hand

516
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:12,529
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way but maybe is mapped</font>

517
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,539
over like a two-and-a-half gigs like

518
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:17,000
time slot then we can provide the 10 gig

519
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:18,710
convenience interfaces but not burn the

520
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,679
entire 10 gigs of<font color="#CCCCCC"> burt the bandwidth</font>

521
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:24,019
across a wide area connection the reason

522
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,120
that in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're looking for</font>

523
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:29,389
some sort of greater<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 gig</font>

524
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,209
concatenation of services but something

525
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:34,820
less and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gig is we have it's not</font>

526
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,679
uncommon to find really large flows of

527
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,110
traffic so it's pretty in common pretty

528
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,480
common for us to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generate 750</font>

529
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,979
Meg flows and in some case case is

530
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,549
greater than that so once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

531
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,929
that those sites flows then relying on

532
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:50,090
some sort of load sharing algal

533
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,649
algorithm for link bundling it's not

534
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,949
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put a lot of</font>

535
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:57,168
faith in and then as we're inter

536
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,870
connective<font color="#CCCCCC"> area Slayer two facilities</font>

537
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:02,419
have some some more robust robust VLAN

538
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,369
tag rewrite capabilities so we can kind

539
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:07,010
of accomplish some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things today</font>

540
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:08,990
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPOs l2vpn s depending</font>

on the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're operating in</font>

542
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:15,980
them and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some URLs that i</font>

543
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,280

549
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,220
network description language so there's

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,780
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of been worked that's happening in</font>

551
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:37,100
the glyph community as a way of kind of

552
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:39,950
so they have the agreed-upon way of kind

553
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,610
of displaying the interconnect between

554
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,410
the different glyph goals there's some

555
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,780
work that's being done to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

556
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,850
standard way of actually defining the

557
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,080
resources that are available and then at

558
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,570
some point actually be able to do

559
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more interesting with that as</font>

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,770
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as perhaps doing some automation</font>

some point pacific wave should be

publishing its own ndl that's something

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,000
question could<font color="#CCCCCC"> Neil's the next presenter</font>

573
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,129
get up here with his laptop because he's

574
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,470
using keynote so we need to get him<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

575
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,670
here um I really thank Dave for coming

576
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,460
in and submitting this presentation

577
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,980
because that Pacific wave was always one

578
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,390
of these sort of enigmas to me of this

579
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,760
wide area distributed exchange platform

580
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,020
operating across multiple administrative

581
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,070
domains noticing how the hell<font color="#E5E5E5"> do they</font>

582
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">get this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think you know</font>

583
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">what one thing that's interesting I said</font>

584
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,899
to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like where's the funding</font>

585
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,600
coming from so I mean you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

586
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,970
say a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that yeah so</font>

587
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way it works is the</font>

588
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,780
Seattle node is it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of</font>

589
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">equipment that's owned by pacific</font>

590
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,110
northwest gig a pop and pacific

591
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,870
northwest gig a pop puts its resources

592
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,719
into that node and then scenic invest

593
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:19,559
the the capital into the the equipment

594
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,999
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> california the port fees on</font>

595
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">pacific wave are basically on a</font>

596
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:26,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-recovery basis and in fact from a</font>

597
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,529
pairing perspective the the port fees

598
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,480
are dirt cheap<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe I can't</font>

599
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember exactly but I believe a 10 gig</font>

600
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">port</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as like a thousand dollars a month</font>

601
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,749
but one of the things in the agreement

602
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that is that the participants that</font>

603
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:39,990
pier on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific wave agreed appear with</font>

604
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,730
Pacific Northwest gate to pop and scenic

605
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,730
so it's kind of acts as a bit of a cost

606
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:49,139
recovery model there but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a like</font>

607
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:51,570
the the cost recovery model is probably

608
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:53,490
not exactly perfect but it's the

609
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,559
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pacific northwest gig a</font>

610
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">pop and scenics dedication to to</font>

611
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,779
ensuring that there's good connectivity

612
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:03,059
up and down the west coast where the

613
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:05,909
international networking okay i'm going

614
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">to question on the sensor from avi you</font>

615
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,990
mentioned the that you don't allow layer

616
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:12,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 devices to connect you also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

617
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the VLAN tag issues so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i assume what</font>

618
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,409
you're saying is most people connect

619
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,499
like catalyst devices that are sort of

620
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:21,389
sort of layer to sort of layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 yeah</font>

621
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:22,860
and that's something that I guess has

622
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,379
become more popular in the last couple

623
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,360
years is the devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> then become more</font>

624
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:31,889
practical to use this is in an hour

625
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,809
routers so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fuzzy area</font>

626
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:35,580
the only thing we can ask at this point

627
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:38,480
is they configure the devices as

628
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:42,090
basically a routed interface versus that

629
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,580
versus they switched interface but it's

630
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,320
it's kind of I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably an</font>

631
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,759
issue for all the exchange operators is

632
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,439
it kind of puts them in a difficult

633
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,450
situation because they want to allow

634
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to connect with reasonable</font>

635
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,200
routers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly inexpensive but</font>

636
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:56,789
at the same time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

637
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,379
anything crazy happening with their

638
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:00,059
exchanges so what we've tried to be able

639
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:02,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do the mac address</font>

640
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,080
limiting with port security and hope

641
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,940
that that catches most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

642
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,350
oddness that goes on there and the

643
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,909
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw you</font>

644
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,350
addressing a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> related</font>

645
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:13,440
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first question actually about</font>

646
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,779
VLAN tag translation the catalyst that

647
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,899
you're running support some amount it's

648
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">only like 128 / ASIC of VLAN translation</font>

649
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:23,459
and then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other platforms that</font>

650
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,779
do vpls vll which also help you with

651
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,389
scaling because now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not limited</font>

652
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to layer 2 for multi trunking and going</font>

653
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,959
between switches right have you played

654
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco or you just say that's</font>

655
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">not scalable enough</font>

656
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,820
for us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually build on so to be</font>

657
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:39,220
honest we haven't we've actually been

658
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:43,178
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid any VLAN tag rewrites so</font>

659
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:45,190
far we<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe the way</font>

660
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,130
that ciscoworks is everything on the

661
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:51,399
same SI kasta use the same rewrite

662
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:52,659
functionality if you on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one</font>

663
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,879
of the things that hopefully may

664
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:57,789
alleviate some of this is if we do

665
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,630
decide to do migrate to mpls l2vpn<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

666
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:03,460
we to at least to some extent it becomes

667
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:11,200
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a port specific</font>

668
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:14,200
port unique type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> VLAN ID set up okay</font>

669
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:21,039
thanks any more questions yeah got one

670
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:23,380
more question hi virendra with the 86

671
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,070
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've just a you touched on</font>

672
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:28,870
the spanning tree root guard it's how

673
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,000
you guys preventing us spanning tree

674
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong's in other words</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ajs playing with</font>

675
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,980
the root domain with our roots or no to

676
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,570
be honest this the spanning tree

677
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,630
deployment is not terribly<font color="#E5E5E5"> sophisticated</font>

678
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:44,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have right now Pacific wave and</font>

679
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:46,779
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Seattle</font>

680
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,330
node and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the California nodes</font>

681
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:53,710
actually operate separate spanning tree

682
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:57,129
domains because the technically the so

683
00:29:53,710 --> 00:30:00,220
the california-based devices are

684
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,990
actually we cooperate them with scenic

685
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,450
but they are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the they have the</font>

686
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,730
provisioning control of those and so

687
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,820
they are kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> act act as a somewhat</font>

688
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:12,940
of a separate entity from the spanning

689
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:16,149
tree perspective so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

690
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,970
we set up the the the Pacific wave

691
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:21,039
switches is the root<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then try and</font>

692
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent that from changing in any other</font>

693
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,809
way and then all in fact some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

694
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases the private vlans were not running</font>

695
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:29,230
spanning tree on those at all because

696
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,510
some of the issues that it runs into

697
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:34,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the downstream devices that</font>

698
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:38,890
people are using so the downstream would

699
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:43,240
be doing as a like a transparent or yet

700
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:45,040
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> day right so on the on the private</font>

701
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,350
vlans we're not

702
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,970
now go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead paraphrasing yeah and this</font>

703
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:54,050
on the private vlans we're not running

704
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:56,660
expanding trade<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if anyone chooses</font>

705
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,220
so basically the theory the connectors

706
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,500
are able to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they decide to</font>

707
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,990
do transparently over over those<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

708
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:08,470
lands it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that discretion exactly</font>

709
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:08,470
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks very much Dave</font>
