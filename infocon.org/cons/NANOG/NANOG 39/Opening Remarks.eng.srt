00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,439
choose which ones we we like the best or

103
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,849
ways such as we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll find most</font>

104
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,608
interesting and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

105
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,409

106
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:19,019
it has to be on topic for the mailing

107
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:19,019
list which means semi technical at least

108
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,880
I need to double check on this I believe

109
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,460
it's tomorrow night we're going to have
