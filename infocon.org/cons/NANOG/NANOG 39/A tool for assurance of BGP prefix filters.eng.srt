00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:07,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so it's been a couple of years</font>

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:12,480
since the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got up in front of</font>

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:17,430
you guys to try a live demo a couple of

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:23,220
slides first basically at<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man log</font>

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:25,050
in st. Louis a bunch of the backbone

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,119
operators got together to talk about

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,150
tools and what kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools would be</font>

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,980
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> is was a little meeting called by</font>

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:37,680
Doug Mon from HS<font color="#CCCCCC"> ARPA and there were two</font>

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,569
things that came out of that one was

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,090
what you're about to see now and the

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:50,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">other was a live RSS feed of who is</font>

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:53,010
changes as they happen which also got

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,270
worked on and mostly done about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week</font>

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,920
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last nanog but then ran into</font>

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,770
intellectual property issues around the

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,540
who is content so we'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:10,860
that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyway so this one</font>

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,780
basically the goals here were to get a

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,000
tulip that would let provisioning

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,950
engineers sanity check the lists of

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,350
prefixes that their customers want to

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">announce out through them so if you're</font>

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,419
running a backbone customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to you</font>

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,280
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> the BGP session says you know here</font>

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,130
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty prefixes who want to</font>

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,900
announce out through you a senior

28
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,280
engineer could probably look at each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,680
those and tell you if there was

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,570
something wacky about one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them but a</font>

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,790
senior engineer probably doesn't have

32
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,220
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through all 50 of them for</font>

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,350
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer and if you hand them to a</font>

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,600
junior<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer who does have time at</font>

35
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,298
least for the lists of 50 if not the

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,610
lists of a thousand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> junior engineer</font>

37
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,869
may not already know off the top of

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,079
their heads what a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

39
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefixes are so the idea here was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

40
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,969
sort of automate that and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

41
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick out the weird ones for a little bit</font>

42
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,309
more scrutiny and what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will save</font>

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,000
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their time by not looking at all</font>

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,520
the ones that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,650
affected and then obviously the next

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,410
step is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crank out a properly</font>

47
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:19,000
formatted prefix list that can be dumped

48
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,829
into a router so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might expect a</font>

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,410
lot of the work in this goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

50
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,060
input parsing because people you know

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:29,040
have all kinds of weird formats that

52
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,630
they want to dump junk into this tool in

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,060
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easy one is just cider</font>

54
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:39,489
right and end end end / mask length but

55
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,970
you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look old who is stuff</font>

56
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:45,580
you've got pre cider ranges you've got

57
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,510
stuff people are dumping in from cisco

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,630
and juniper configs from output from

59
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,130
display commands on routers stuff coming

60
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,730
out of other kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of provisioning</font>

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:02,109
systems lots of stuff out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our IR and</font>

62
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">irr who is so we were trying to parse</font>

63
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,330
all of that stuff as rationally as we

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,679
can and I think you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find we're doing</font>

65
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,380
a reasonably good job but we'd be very

66
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,620
interested to hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> any exceptions</font>

67
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:17,859
that you find then we do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

68
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,630
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> database lookups</font>

69
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,220
into the different databases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

70
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,290
keep of different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

71
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,540
infrastructure so we flag all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogans</font>

72
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,120
and critical infrastructure like

73
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:32,190
exchange point subnets and root and TLD

74
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,530
name servers we flag long prefixes so

75
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,799
anything longer than a / 24 right now

76
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,350
but you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dump in a table of</font>

77
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,650
your own preferred maximum prefix

78
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:50,620
lengths for each range out of the v4

79
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:52,630
space then we draw a little map of the

80
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,660
world and show on the map<font color="#E5E5E5"> where these</font>

81
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,100
prefixes map tues so that you know if

82
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,359
there's one that's different from the

83
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">others you can spot it easily we grab a</font>

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:12,420
little malware incident to address ratio

85
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,420
statistics from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wesson's outfit</font>

86
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:19,548
support intelligence and we kind of sum

87
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,440
that up into a ratio and then we put a

88
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,000
lot of this stuff up in a table so that

89
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,479
you can sort of sort at different ways

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,389
and look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of it and</font>

91
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,280
then the output we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco prefix list</font>

92
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:37,610
juniper prefix lists and juniper set

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:50,750
commands so time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a live demo ah just</font>

94
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:52,370
just kidding<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right so I'm going</font>

95
00:04:50,750 --> 00:05:04,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of over my</font>

96
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:06,860
shoulder here so somebody want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> poop</font>

97
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,120
where's cursor there we go somebody'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

98
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,470
give me a couple of prefixes that

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,889
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to recognize</font>

100
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:18,979
whether we've got them right somebody

101
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:20,720
Mike RSL<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell all right this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

102
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:29,050
plant somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come up after</font>

103
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:37,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">our sure 192 okay 148 1 48 to 50 20</font>

104
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:42,740
space 0 0 1 255 ok let's see how that

105
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:48,369
one works and any others come on

106
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:55,210
somebody here on it's not dangerous

107
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:57,100
harmless come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys hello we'll start</font>

108
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:03,549
selecting volunteers don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> him yeah</font>

109
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:06,340
okay try 146 stop 188 dot 0 dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 okay</font>

110
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,410
so I'm not bothering<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a mask on here</font>

111
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,719
we'll see if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets it right Ted how</font>

112
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:14,470
about you one years later all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

113
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,510
so to show you the kind of stuff that we

114
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:23,430
can digest successfully I'm going to

115
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:26,169
dump in some other things here as well

116
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:33,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got those two then we've</font>

117
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:36,099
got a show IP bgp show IP route some

118
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,860
show run the route statements and route

119
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:46,000
map statements and then some who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is down</font>

120
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:49,350
there so let's submit it and this is

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a little while because</font>

122
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,520
this entire thing database and

123
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:58,360
everything is at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

124
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,190
single little<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac mini which is why i</font>

125
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,229
have the URL hidden up there at the

126
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment because I'd really rather that</font>

127
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">only me and a few other people be using</font>

128
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,780
it right now what we do the demo and

129
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:11,979
then you guys can all start playing with

130
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,479
it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment the demo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is done so we're</font>

131
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:17,650
grinding through some database queries

132
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:21,130
here and rendering a map which yes will

133
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:27,880
only take another few seconds there we

134
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:35,169
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is probably easiest to</font>

135
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:37,620
see if we sort it look sorting is not

136
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,620
working there

137
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there we go because it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

138
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,930
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well okay so there's the map you</font>

139
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,299
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most of these were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

140
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,970
US we've got a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit in Mexico a</font>

141
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,120
little bit in Canada and a little bit in

142
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,730
South Africa here so right off the bat

143
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,520
if we're writing a prefix list for an

144
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,650
ISP in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to look at</font>

145
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,229
that South African one and say hmm you

146
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:12,650
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that one isn't right so let's</font>

147
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:14,900
sort by country and go find that so

148
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,030
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the South African one you can</font>

149
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:22,370
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal prefix checks out</font>

150
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:24,979
ok so it's checked by default so we

151
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,270
might want to uncheck that to say no we

152
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,770
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one's okay we're going</font>

153
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take it out of the list that we're</font>

154
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:34,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the prefix list we're going to</font>

155
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:41,780
generate now let's go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at</font>

156
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:45,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> others so this one we've kicked out</font>

157
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:49,130
because it's the it's got the dns server

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,610
for the TT country code in it turn it up

159
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,439
trinidad and tobago but you know I

160
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,910
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is and know</font>

161
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,290
that that one's okay so we'll include

162
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:03,290
that then we've caught the one here 198

163
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,319
32<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot 176 which many of you may</font>

164
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,310
recognize that's packs so we probably

165
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:15,560
shouldn't include packs then we've got

166
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:17,449
another one here 206 to 20 to 30 / 24

167
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,040
but that's already included in another

168
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,430
one that was already in the list so we

169
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:29,839
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to include it again here's be</font>

170
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:32,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">rude and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look cursor down there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

171
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,050
here's one with a whole bunch of TLD

172
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:43,490
servers in it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also know is okay</font>

173
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:46,520
and we've got a bug on 192 168 and then

174
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,270
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I know</font>

175
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,079
belongs to various customers whatever

176
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,930
also we can

177
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:58,480
and hit show errors here and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

178
00:09:53,930 --> 00:10:02,449
the parsing errors were right so prefix

179
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,430
0000 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to general and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

180
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,900
things where we looked at the line and

181
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:11,449
there just wasn't anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font>

182
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:13,910
like prefix in it but anyway so we we

183
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,340
have that show airs button anytime we

184
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,459
had any parsing errors so it shows up

185
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,650
some of the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's say</font>

186
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:25,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to go ahead and generate a</font>

187
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:29,689
prefix list for this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

188
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:33,470
Luke sorry we scroll down so you can see

189
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:39,740
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a little bit better say I want</font>

190
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:41,660
to call this Bill's list and let's say I

191
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,170
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add this onto an existing prefix</font>

192
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:48,230
list that has goes up through 300 right

193
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:51,920
now so let's start that at 310 and let's

194
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,410
say I like my increments in fives so

195
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,329
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all just you know copy and paste</font>

196
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:03,490
able off of here let's say that actually

197
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want to pop it into a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper instead</font>

198
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:12,220
got juniper intercept commands you know

199
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,900
various ways of popping us stuff out and

200
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,340
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to add more the the output</font>

201
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,530
side of this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> really trivial</font>

202
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:23,030
compared to all the parsing and database

203
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,040
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other things that we can do</font>

204
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,189
here aside<font color="#CCCCCC"> from just submitting lists of</font>

205
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,800
prefixes and generating prefix lists

206
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,470
like I said set maximum prefix length if

207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,089
you want to give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a table of maximum</font>

208
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,550
prefix lengths in different ranges of

209
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:42,260
the v4 space again happy to take those

210
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,620
that feature is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done yet but</font>

211
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be shortly custom exclusion lists</font>

212
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,630
also not quite done yet but should be

213
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">shortly where if you have things that</font>

214
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want flagged in input that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

215
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,790
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want that to be public for</font>

216
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,079
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like your own internal</font>

217
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,430
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't want to</font>

218
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear from customers that kind of thing</font>

219
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,620
you can put it in and we'll save<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

220
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:11,300
for your use but other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't see</font>

221
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:13,610
it report critical infrastructure so if

222
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,079
there's something that you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

223
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,550
don't know about that you think is

224
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,950
critical infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can report</font>

225
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to us and we'll figure out whether to</font>

226
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:26,150
add it into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general list of things</font>

227
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:29,600
that get flagged with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the stuff</font>

228
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,550
we have links with definitions here so

229
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,380
if again you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw a junior</font>

230
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,560
engineers at this you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite know</font>

231
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:40,279
what we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about we try and be</font>

232
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,439
as helpful as possible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lastly</font>

233
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,270
of course the future and bug report

234
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:52,779
there in case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> run into anything</font>

235
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:56,750
please let us know so let's wrap up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:59,480
slides here so future<font color="#E5E5E5"> features like I</font>

237
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:03,820
said the custom acceptable prefix length

238
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:07,190
stables custom prefix rejection tables

239
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:10,280
guess rejection<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept tables so if you</font>

240
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,600
want us to flag things based on a esas

241
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,959
that you don't want to see in the path

242
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,400
or that are automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in the</font>

243
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,000
path we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have both of those</font>

244
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">features another trickier one previous</font>

245
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,280
transit is uniformity<font color="#CCCCCC"> checks so if you</font>

246
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,740
give us a list of prefixes we'll look

247
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and see whether those prefixes</font>

248
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,730
mostly have the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> a esas in common</font>

249
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,219
that they were getting transit from

250
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,290
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if so we'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to flag</font>

251
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,780
ones that don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have those in commons so</font>

252
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,280
if a customer a new potential customer

253
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,680
comes to you and says you know all these

254
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,689
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are my customer will be able to</font>

255
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,310
flag ones that look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe they</font>

256
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,870
didn't have that guy as their service

257
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:53,839
provider in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past also suggesting</font>

258
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:57,830
potential aggregates so if you give us

259
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,540
you know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that includes 16 / 24</font>

260
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,910
s in the list that could aggregate up

261
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,339
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to suggest the aggregate</font>

262
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,500
for you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put just one line</font>

263
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:11,630
in instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 16 lines into your final</font>

264
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:13,850
list next ml<font color="#E5E5E5"> API for integrating this</font>

265
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,630
into your provisioning system so if you

266
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,970
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just fire something off for</font>

267
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,230
your existing provisioning system rather

268
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,910
than logging in in the web<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface</font>

269
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,350
you'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the same data back</font>

270
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:28,980
in XML and do whatever you want with it

271
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">I RR submission generations so another</font>

272
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,550
output format aside from the juniper and

273
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,089
cisco prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists is a template to mail</font>

274
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,130
in to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRR so we want to just do that</font>

275
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">for you automatically as well again not</font>

276
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:47,250
quite done yet and lastly ipv6 we

277
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,630
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had a request for v6</font>

278
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,910
yet but a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have mentioned</font>

279
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:53,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they think other people would want</font>

280
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:56,219
it soon so again we didn't try and get

281
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:59,310
