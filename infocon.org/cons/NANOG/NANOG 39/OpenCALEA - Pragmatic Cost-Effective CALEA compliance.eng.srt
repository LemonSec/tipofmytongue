1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,390
my name is Manish I work at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt and</font>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,730
i'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking very quickly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,660
ugly five letter word<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,590
surprisingly haven't heard mentioned

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much in the past couple of days</font>

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:20,039
namely Kalia so what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">about is our experiences in going down</font>

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,000
this path because you know we're

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,830
required to go down the path as per the

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,289
FCC regulations so a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of months</font>

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,198
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we at Merritt decided to look at</font>

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,120
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take for us to do what is</font>

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,309
required<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Kalia for the to</font>

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,589
perform the wiretaps we took a look at

15
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,140
the standards and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said well rather</font>

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,730
than going down the vendor path what if

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">we tried to just implement what the</font>

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,410
standard says and try to be as<font color="#E5E5E5"> close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,180
the spirit of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is required to get</font>

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,648
<font color="#E5E5E5">there so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm what I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe</font>

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,180
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of experiments that we did</font>

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,820
to see whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this was feasible and and some</font>

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,989
quick cost trade-offs whatever what

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,510
would it cost us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement our</font>

26
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,099
solutions versus going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to to the</font>

27
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,270
vendor path so our goals were mainly

28
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,070
develop an<font color="#E5E5E5"> experimental reference</font>

29
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,340
architecture that would serve as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a model</font>

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,860
for clear compliance determine what

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,950
level of compliance is possible at at a

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,810
reasonable price point because you know

33
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:22,020
the the the standard doesn't really

34
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,490
specify various performance criteria how

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,320
what percentage of packets are you

36
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,298
expected to tap are you expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,589
hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-nine percent of</font>

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,079
the time or one hundred percent hundred

39
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,270
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time all the and it's</font>

40
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,889
it's an extremely vague standard it's

41
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,210
still not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard it's just a</font>

42
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,369
proposed standard so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know</font>

43
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,949
how it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve even though the</font>

44
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,649
deadline<font color="#CCCCCC"> for filing paperwork is next</font>

45
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,170
week i believe so we decided to

46
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,840
basically dig in and see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

47
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,920
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could approach this problem</font>

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,750
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course one of the key things we</font>

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
wanted to keep in track of was<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

50
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,530
simple hardware cots where where

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,469
possible because cost is a key<font color="#CCCCCC"> factor</font>

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,640
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have well at least it</font>

53
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,380
married about<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine or ten different</font>

54
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,500
points where we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would need to</font>

55
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,600
apply this of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we would need to</font>

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at 10 gig solutions because those</font>

57
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,609
links would be 10 gig and more

58
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,530
importantly one of the key goals was our

59
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,510
approach in this was was the

60
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,520
nanog approach which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's build open</font>

61
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">source tools that others can use to and</font>

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,690
contribute to we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we go</font>

63
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:26,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">down this path on our own and we're the</font>

64
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,990
only ones doing doing using our tools it

65
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,720
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not align with the standard it may</font>

66
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,900
not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful but if there's enough</font>

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,400
community support for this it can become

68
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,050
a well accepted practice for doing this

69
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,720
so two experiments that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

70
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,030
describe very quickly the first was just

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,180
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very preliminary experiment use a</font>

72
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,519
dell workstation it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2g</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interfaces</font>

73
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,080
and see what we can tap and then the

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,630
second experiment was a much more

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,459
realistic experiment where we decided to

76
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,380
say well let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to scale it up and</font>

77
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,690
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens at 10 gig and what</font>

78
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,030
performance we get we're using

79
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-source tools these are linux-based</font>

80
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,489
tap boxes the second experiment uses a

81
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,290
10 gig card we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux on them</font>

82
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,000
we're using iperf as a traffic generator

83
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,980
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first part and then the second</font>

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,900
and of course there's life traffic in

85
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,109
the background so our experiments were

86
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,750
conducted in a live network our metrics

87
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,720
are that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to track</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as using</font>

88
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,730
simple hardware simple software what

89
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,489
kind of captures can be performed and

90
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,290
wondered our platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

91
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,989
experiment was simple we installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

92
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,078
captured desktop workstation in our

93
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,850
building switch just use simple port

94
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,410
mirroring and then try to measure if

95
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,930
somebody is coming in off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DSL line</font>

96
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,720
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and you try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a</font>

97
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,609
tap at the building level what kind of

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,060
performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you get the aggregate</font>

99
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,890
bandwidth that was going on the switch

100
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,140
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time was about 200 megabits per</font>

101
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,700
second in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first test and then about</font>

102
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,880
four hundred megabits per second and the

103
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,730
second round<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we do measurements for</font>

104
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,579
simple and large UDP flows and here are

105
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,078
results so for what you can see is

106
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,510
roughly across the board we see less

107
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent packet loss and more</font>

108
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,989
importantly the packet losses that we

109
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,940
were seeing were going across the

110
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet anyways they weren't as a</font>

111
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:25,169
result of the tap box itself so second

112
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,729
experiment was a scale-up experiment we

113
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:31,310
ran it off of a

114
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,330
10<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig span port across a fiber link and</font>

115
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,360
what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> over here is going</font>

116
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">across from the merit offices to to a</font>

117
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,550

118
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,349
across from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ann arbor to chicago we do a</font>

119
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,120
span port on the 10 gig port and that's

120
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,730
where the tap device is installed out in

121
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">chicago and of course for this</font>

capturing the traffic it's doing the

background traffic that we have on the

130
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,760
switch at that time is anywhere between

131
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,640
two to two-and-a-half gigabits per

132

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,020
do is actually capture the small stream

of traffic that is user generated by our

137
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,940
iperf testing of course we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep</font>

138
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,550
in mind additional complications such as

multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans how do we tap across all</font>

vlans empty use in the in the

141
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:35,970
retransmission path and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so very</font>

142
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,400
quickly our results the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 gig cards</font>

143
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,020
because the platform is a little bit

144
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,049

146
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,520
do get better capture performance we're

147
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:50,070
seeing a less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than less than 1% packet</font>

of traffic and at very extreme bit rates

150
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,479
this is so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this graph is basically</font>

you're not careful you will run into MTU

170
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,540
that captures that<font color="#CCCCCC"> two two-and-a-half</font>

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,810
the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs for this platform was</font>

174
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,210
about twenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> five hundred dollars of</font>

175
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,690
which the server cost 1300 and the 10

176
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,580
gig cards is about half of the cost so

177
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,500
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool said that we're developing is</font>

178
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,020
to has two or three different parts the

179
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,330
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tap program itself which is</font>

180
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,570
using pcap library to do the patrick

181
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,219
packet captures on the right filters and

182
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,080
then it will also after doing the

183
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,150
capture will do the encapsulation and

184
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,150
the retransmission back out there's the

185
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,859
example receiver tool which will receive

186
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the package and encapsulate and generate</font>

187
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,910
back out a pcap file and then of course

188
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's there's some additional stuff</font>

189
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,730
each you need to do in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

190
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,280
multiple tap points you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

I'm describing today is a practical

them better another any questions we've

got about just under two minutes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

210
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,400
questions and while we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

211
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:14,830
questions can date night come up there

212
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,960
and get ready I hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jared March NTT</font>

213
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,840
America I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your your</font>

214
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,659
tools support the t1 IAS protocol which

215
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,250
is the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> current safe harbor standard</font>

216
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:30,930
for any sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet type intercept</font>

217
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:34,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is recognized within under the Act</font>

218
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:37,539
right so what we were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at was the</font>

219
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">ptsc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed standard which proposes</font>

220
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,699
three different encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanisms</font>

221
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,550
for transmitting the captured packets

222
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:50,050
across we're implementing i believe the

223
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,729
IAS packet format and it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

224
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,560
we're implementing the packet format

225
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,030
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is described in the proposed</font>

226
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,839
standard so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe we're as</font>

227
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:00,220
closes can be to draft if the draft were

228
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,750
to change we'd have to make changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

229
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,450
well but yes I do believe we are

230
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,100
complying with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard</font>

231
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,820
laid out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pts see proposed</font>

232
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,890
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay also also have you worked</font>

233
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,890
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kalina implementation unit at</font>

234
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,120
DOJ to to let them<font color="#CCCCCC"> know of the</font>

235
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,610
availability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your tool set and</font>

236
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,010
whether or not they see that that would

237
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,230
fit you know the needs of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

238
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,330
requirements so the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that is no</font>

239
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,820
we have not yet looked at them this

240
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,920
project is only about two months old and

241
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,490
we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do very quick feasibility</font>

242
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,990
tests first before we had any reasonable

243
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,430
level of confidence in<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we were</font>

244
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing and whether it would actually work</font>

245
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,719
you have 30 seconds okay really quickly

246
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,780
so that so sorry I'm Chris I work for

247
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,690
Verizon Business so your<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach is</font>

248
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,189
essentially to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap close to the end user</font>

249
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,760
that's that you need to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

250
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,260
physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> tap yes we're tapping off a</font>

251
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,660
foot 10 gig switch so it's actually

252
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,000
towards the the middle of the network

253
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,010
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to the campuses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">where Billy we are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be what we</font>

255
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,550
call gateway compliant so we are not

256
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,520
tapping on the on our customer

257
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:15,040
interfaces but actually on our outgoing

258
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,990
internet interfaces and even at<font color="#E5E5E5"> only not</font>

259
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,660
like channelized interfaces or<font color="#E5E5E5"> sonnet</font>

260
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,180
interfaces so far the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware card</font>

261
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,689
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been using is only the 10 gige</font>

262
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:30,189
marcom adapter so only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

263
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,850
that's right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay thanks thanks</font>

264
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,850
Manish I was great
