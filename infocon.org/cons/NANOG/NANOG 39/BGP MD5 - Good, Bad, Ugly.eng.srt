1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,930
okay hi I'm Tom shell with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 and this</font>

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,760
presentation is going to go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp md5</font>

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,849
you know what it's used for why it's

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,769
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know the potential for an</font>

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,780
attack vector where somebody could

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,320
really throw packets at your router with

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,520
an invalid md5 and what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,320
impact of it because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,570
everyone's really you know stated what

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,539
if it's good if it's bad you know what's

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the story behind it so there's a</font>

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">little play on the Canadian cigarettes</font>

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,329
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they have a little bit colorful</font>

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,730
warnings and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States from</font>

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:42,390
just a little play on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Photoshop</font>

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:44,578
work so somebody laughs that's so bgp

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,410
md5 what is it really solving and it's

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a method to authenticate the</font>

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,889
remote end of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP pier which is</font>

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,300
important because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to probably</font>

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,520
prevent your sessions from being

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,440
hijacked or severed and in addition

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,940
there's some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there may be</font>

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">Miss configuration you know their</font>

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,280
stories about where some customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

26
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,570
we will turn up<font color="#CCCCCC"> at e1 and note that you</font>

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,519
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> their bgp session was configured</font>

28
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,799
for an ibgp session which is pretty bad

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,500
so you know if your configs always by

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,270
default<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam d5 enabled you probably</font>

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem so it's</font>

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,030
definitely a good practice to do and in

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,340
addition it was well advertised

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">workaround to a tcp/ip issue reported</font>

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,250
two to three years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of came</font>

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:30,030
out across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all will get</font>

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">into it so um the background BTW md5</font>

38
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,979
it's really not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function of bgp it's</font>

39
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,259
18 to 20 bytes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp options field</font>

40
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,090
that's calculated by various things that

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,549
pseudo header the header any segment

42
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,320
data and the actual key itself so pretty

43
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">much think of it it's a password for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP session and so what about the actual</font>

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,740
vulnerability that came out a few years

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,409
ago and the issue had to do with how

47
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,810
routers were you know actually

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,310
authenticating a session which was you

49
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,350
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was a risk that somebody</font>

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,939
could try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute force a beach be</font>

51
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,048
session where they could sooner or later

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,149
send a reset and sever<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p session</font>

53
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:11,240
another additional twist on this was you

54
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,310
could send icmp and reach them

55
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,070
edge and try to accomplish the same

56
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,220
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> too as well and so md if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

57
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,799
pushed as the workaround to resolve this

58
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,200
which was well if you need to verify the

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,080
packet you know no attacker would be

60
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,030
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to determine that so the problem</font>

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be solved and it was the way it</font>

62
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,430
came out was a little bit strange

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,380
because all of a sudden everyone started

64
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,670
asking for md5 at a certain time and it

65
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,680
was somewhere along the lines of when

66
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,929
every network provider starts upgrading

67
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,320
the routers within a week so what kind

68
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,670
of knew something was going on and the

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,799
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

70
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,179
operational complexities Beach<font color="#CCCCCC"> PMD 5 is</font>

71
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,060
not easy for everyone a lot of

72
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,130
automation a lot of tools OSS types of

73
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,790
things that provision customers that we

74
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,170
you know modify to support md5 another

75
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,120
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you do have customers at</font>

76
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,739
75 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairs for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,110
store that data you store it in you know

78
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">text files i'm sort of database you know</font>

79
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,140
storing it somewhere is kind of a risk

80
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,990
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then how do you actually</font>

81
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,519
transmit<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmitted exchange the key</font>

telephone senate an email you know it's

84
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,900
if it's in clear text what if you really

85
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,970
solved and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is how do you</font>

86
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,860
actually generate the password you know

87
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,359
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just randomly making it up are</font>

88
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to any of the you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you</font>

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,120
google around for a password generator

90
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,100
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find plenty of websites that</font>

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll generator it for you but who's</font>

92
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,460
saving all that data you never know take

93
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,850
a look at the source I peas and some

94
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:38,810
HTTP access log and perhaps start using

95
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,549
that so how to properly exchange md5

96
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,840
keys so if anyone remembers the TV show

97
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,330
gets smart there was this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,440
the code of<font color="#E5E5E5"> silence and you know is this</font>

99
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,110
the way you have to do it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

100
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">in pig latin as well just as a twist but</font>

101
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,810
it didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that well on the</font>

102
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">show so it probably wouldn't really work</font>

103
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:58,970
here so um what's a real impact of you

104
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,920
know md5 which is it's the router is

105
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,540
basically looking at the TCP header and

106
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,660
has to count you know determine if its

107
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,429
proper or not and it had router obvious

108
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,600
s do a bit more additional work so

109
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the show load for the route</font>

110
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,930
processor which is already busy doing

111
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,470
other critical tasks such as best path

112
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,030
decision processing your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp management</font>

113
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,988
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the less</font>

114
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,929
work you have to get the route processor

115
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,250
the better so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is what happens</font>

116
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,340
if an attacker would

117
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,150
happen to spoof<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stream</font>

118
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,909
flood your router with incorrect md5

119
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,620
hashes and could they make your you know

120
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,570
router cpu utilization go up and that

121
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,760
would then impact other protocols on the

122
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">router you know other bgp sessions other</font>

123
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,909
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp adjacencies things like that so</font>

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,040
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what's the impact</font>

125
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,470
of someone actually you know taking down

126
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,120
the router and the you know kind of

127
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,770
brings up another question which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why</font>

128
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,910
should somebody sending spoof packets to

129
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,109
your router in the first place why are

130
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,570
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> even getting there and that's</font>

131
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,730
that's a whole other issue aside and you

132
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,260
know shouldn't everybody be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> vcp 38</font>

133
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,660
and filtering this well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality is</font>

134
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">not everybody does that so and in some</font>

135
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,520
cases it's just not feasible when you

136
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,160
have shared lands you know / 23 / 24<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,880
a you know public exchange point it's a

138
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit harder to do that and the</font>

139
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,940
actual though you know md5 as a whole is

140
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,070
it really the best solution going

141
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,350
forward to secure bgp sessions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it</font>

142
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,380
works now is the best thing that we

143
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,419
should do going forward so some of the

144
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,669
other options for example is the TTL

145
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,620
security check or GT sm which is a

146
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,030
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice way to say you know not</font>

147
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,410
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at layer 4 but looking at layer</font>

148
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,570
3 which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the IP</font>

149
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,450
TTL and say did this really come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

150
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,640
neighbor and it does this by when you

151
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,159
transmit bgp packets to a neighbor it

152
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,020
just sets the highest TTL value possible

153
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,450
the neighbor expects to see it as a

154
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,530
certain limit or above and you know it

155
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,620
works really well since no one could

156
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,909
really spoof that from six hops away

157
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,770
another option is well perhaps we can

158
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,600
tunnel it should we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP session</font>

159
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,270
and put it over some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

160
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,300
transport mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet dot1q frame</font>

161
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> delsea a GRE tunnel mpls</font>

162

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:13,550
reflector somewhere other kind of hacks

164
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:15,950
like that so another option is EV gb

165
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-hop right so this is I'll getting</font>

166
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,280
this later as to<font color="#CCCCCC"> why this really doesn't</font>

167
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,919
work that well and you know anti

spoofing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACLs well if you could stop all</font>

169
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,210
the spoofing then there won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

170
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,609
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> but well that's another story so</font>

171
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,960
I would tested a variety of platforms or

172
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,390
whatever I could get my hands on and

173

some platforms they'll actually when

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,570
they receive a packet with invalid or no

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,400
you have a you know thousands of packets

193
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,599
per second there's some sort of logging

194
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,979
mechanism within the router that's

195
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,200
constantly logging that it's received

196
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,389
one bag packet for each individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

198
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,889
or suppress you know this over time and

199
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,940
in some platforms this could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

200
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,800
worse if you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,360
logging to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Council which is you know</font>

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,330
isn't really that great either and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

204
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,740
could actually be the bulk of the cpu

205
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,930
utilization is actually used on this

206
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,900
rather than anything related to TCP

207
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,550
session tracking another thing is some

208
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,200
platforms that they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do the</font>

209
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,729
TTL check-in hardware I mean it sounds

210
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a great feature but no one really</font>

211
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">had anything and hardwood actually</font>

212
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,310
analyze the IP TTL fell you know when

213
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,720
you know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people requested it so</font>

214
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,180
vendors probably didn't had it I'm

215
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,010
assuming for many years so it's actually

216
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">done in you know the route processor for</font>

217
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,330
example which really doesn't buy you all

218
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,890
that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the testings shown that it</font>

219
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,729
really had kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same impact as</font>

220
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:12,070
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know doing md5 or not and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

221
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:13,570
example on a lower end was it grp be but

222
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,070
actually you know at a low speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack</font>

223
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,650
it did increase the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs somewhat</font>

224
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,180
significantly um and then another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

225
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,729
is some platforms actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> examined the</font>

226
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,260
md5 hash before the IP TTL so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

227
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:26,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">you had a session</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was enabled with</font>

228
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:28,240
md5 as well as the IP TTL check and you

229
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,419
said something with<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly the wrong</font>

230
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,570
TTL clearly spoofed and you had

231
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:36,429
incorrect<font color="#CCCCCC"> TTR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> md5 hash and the md5 hash</font>

232
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,409
would be alerted as you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

233
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,049
invalid which so it's obviously checking

234
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,350
md5 before I PTL which doesn't make much

235
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,979
sense so the actual difference between

236
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,529
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sign packet</font>

237
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,240
and one without was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that much</font>

238
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,100
in fact in most cases it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was less than</font>

239
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten percent of CP utilization of an</font>

240
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">increase so you know modern hardware it</font>

241
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,540
really didn't make it that much of a

242
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,399
difference so I mean there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

243
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,199
have commented it you know that you know

244
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,240
md5 is a valid attack vector I mean I'm

245
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:03,979
just not seeing yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps you know a</font>

246
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,110
lower put you know platforms this might

247
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,000
be the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just you know the real</font>

248
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,350
issue here is that you have lots of

249
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,730
packets per second going to a route

250
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,320
processor and it's touching something

251
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,620
internal to the system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it shouldn't</font>

252
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,600
and you know using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TTL checks within</font>

253
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,310
software that some<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors do support</font>

254
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,610
really didn't buy you that much it was

255
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,399
the same impact so some of the other

256
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,019
alternatives you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the TTL</font>

257
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,920
checking if it was done in hardware and

258
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:30,529
some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where other</font>

259
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,329
platforms could do this serious ones is

260
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,180
reportedly can some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the higher-end</font>

261
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:37,310
juniper boxes of oil can do it anything

262
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,930
else I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really that sure if anybody</font>

263
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,819
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it so I'd be curious to find</font>

264
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,779
out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody if this is you know</font>

265
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:47,510
feature possible or is planned<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so</font>

266
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,670
some of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative methods to</font>

267
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,350
do bgp so if you can't secure it with

268
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,719
the way that's already in place you know

269
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,790
what else can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you try try eb gb</font>

270
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,019
multi-hop for example which you really

271
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that not really hiding anything</font>

272
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:00,709
other than IP addresses that are used

273
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:01,910
within the TCP session so you may

274
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,589
suppose you know source it from a

275
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,329
loopback interface or you may add an

276
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,709
additional loopback interface all it

277
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,359
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is hide it and sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

278
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,969
doesn't always fix it somebody can<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font>

279
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you may have a looking glass or route</font>

280
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,199
server and they can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn those</font>

281
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,880
speech p addresses you know if you do

282
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:19,130
use a loopback well most people's

283
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,199
routers have you know dns and nslookup

284
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,730
will clearly reveal what the loop backs

285
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:25,069
are so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

286
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,569
sometimes and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop</font>

287
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,069
there's really no failure detection if

288
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:29,750
it's crossing mobile devices somebody

289
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:31,130
has a switch in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know may</font>

290
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,350
not detect when there's a failure so

291
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,939
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doesn't work that well the</font>

292
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,500
other issue is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a separate</font>

293
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,790
interface or tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> additional</font>

294
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,470
complexity you're doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

295
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,300
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a one-off not every pair can do</font>

296
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,160
it so you're supporting something<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique</font>

297
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,149
and plus if you're learning it over a

298
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">different session with different</font>

299
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,389
addresses you're going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

300
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,610
rewrite the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgb next hops which is yet</font>

301
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:53,180
another one off and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

302
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">work that well so um let's go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

303
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,489
the road I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what the bigger</font>

304
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,510
picture is why are these packets even

305
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,980
hitting your route processor in the

306
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,550
first

307
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,079
so the real problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an md5 or IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ttls</font>

308
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,910
you know why are they getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

309
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,519
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's spoofing them is</font>

310
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,660
there a way to actually fix that well so

311
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,279
if you have to now where's that pair

312
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,589
together let's say it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

313
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,060
provider and a customer you know one

314
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,440
option some networks have done this is

315
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,089
they don't redistribute the customers

316
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,250
directly connected interface which is a

317
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,930
really great plan except there's some

318
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,060
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have to source let's say</font>

319
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,410
they run that on there when uplink well

320
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,638
in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> it breaks it and you may</font>

321
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,430
have to number the customer out of a

322
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">different space some routers you could</font>

323
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:33,069
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> an egress ACL for example towards the</font>

324
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:34,899
pair and when you generate a packet from

325
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,790
the route processor it actually bypasses

326
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,470
that ACL so that would actually work but

327
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,630
not everybody's implementation is the

328
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,490
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to do egress acl's that it may</font>

329
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:47,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">be unique and doesn't always work as</font>

330
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,310
well so another<font color="#E5E5E5"> option is you know what</font>

331
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,310
happens when you have internet exchange

332
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,709
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> add your spaces um you know should</font>

333
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">we perhaps add this into you know if you</font>

334
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,369
do have infrastructure ACL should this

335
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,139
be considered a part of it why allow the

336
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,180
packets even to go there<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do people</font>

337
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:04,120
have business pinging things and watch

338
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,290
it at traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> even go there but of</font>

339
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,240
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what do you do and you</font>

340
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,639
have private pairing sessions with

341
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,620
another pair for example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

342
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,720
know you you know typically people trade

343
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,600
on one off you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> use my address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

344
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,220
this / 30 or 31 they use theirs you can

345
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,370
update all your customer facing ACL is

346
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,170
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it just does not work another</font>

347
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,069
option is and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of covers a lot</font>

348
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,349
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as brought up earlier why</font>

349
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:30,939
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> every I just redistributing</font>

350
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,959
internet exchange point address space

351
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,310
within your I I GP or ibgp domain you

352
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,469
know why even do that in the first riff

353
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,810
don't even let people route to it is

354
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that feasible it possibly is but given</font>

355
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,449
that the fact that people are already

356
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:45,579
originating internet exchange address

357
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:48,550
space on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet today it probably</font>

358
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:50,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not going to happen so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really what</font>

359
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">are your options that you can do well if</font>

360
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,569
you do have the hardware that supports

361
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,729
it you can actually you know do the

362
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:56,560
actual TTL checking within you know

363
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,670
hardware and it works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just have</font>

364
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,069
to coordinate it and hopefully the other

365
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,750
side supports it as well I mean like I

366
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:03,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">said there's not very many platforms</font>

367
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,870
that can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if there's</font>

368
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,449
any others or on the road map for

369
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,420
anybody and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as a word of</font>

370
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,800
caution

371
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,120
you know control policing that's

372
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,979
implemented the software really doesn't

373
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,150
always buy you that much so you know

374
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,580
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of various hacks that you</font>

375
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,770
could do but you know I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard was</font>

376
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:25,160
just out there today so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

377
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,160
any questions

378
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:38,150
amazing

379
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:38,150
ok there's no questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi Tom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>
