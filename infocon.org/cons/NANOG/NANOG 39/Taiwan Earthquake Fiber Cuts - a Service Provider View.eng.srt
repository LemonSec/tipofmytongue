1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
hey um I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very vocal in the past</font>

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:13,139
to ask for real life provider stories

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,390
how do you deal with complex issues

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:20,039
how'd you deal with problem so I guess I

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,560
haven't picked the easiest subject but

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,980
I'll explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we saw from a service</font>

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:30,080
provider point of view about the Taiwan

earthquake that happened on<font color="#E5E5E5"> December 26</font>

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:42,750
so you'll see it's not a pretty story so

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:49,709
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will go into what is required</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:01:09,930
build a backbone tonight cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see</font>

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:01:12,810
my screen here ok so I'll make things

13
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,229
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so how do we build a</font>

14
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,350
backbone from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. to Asia what our</font>

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,000
repairs and what's the current situation

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">and lessons for the future so how do you</font>

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">build an Asia backbone there's actually</font>

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,570
two types of subsea cables that you need

23
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,420
you need some trans-pacific portions and

24
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,210
you need some intra-asia portions so in

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,810
the trans-pacific you have a choice of

26
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:52,860

really putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spotlight on Asia for</font>

35
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,200
2006 so we've been adding geographies to

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,450
sites in Singapore one site in Tokyo we

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,369
consolidated our Hong Kong presence we

38
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:30,290
upgraded bandwidth on all segments and

39
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:33,090
we also are planning always looking at

40
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,230
when we plan and design our<font color="#CCCCCC"> background</font>

41
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,840
we need to have subsea cable diversity

42
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:44,880
always favored low latency and always

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:49,170

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:44,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">on December 26 there is an earthquake of</font>

magnitude 7.1 four minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

59
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,890
actually eight minutes later there was

another one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> six point nine and then</font>

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,180
aftershock was three<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours later at 5.5</font>

64
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:05,549
so it was very very severe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what made</font>

65
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,680
this earthquake severe is the depth of

66
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:11,190
the earthquake it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 kilometers</font>

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,150
down so it causes typically a lot of

68
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,150
damage on the seabed

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,460
so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> were all the cables hit if you</font>

70
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:26,030
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cable designs you see that</font>

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,000
Luzon Strait which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the</font>

74
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,550
Philippines and Taiwan so you always

<font color="#CCCCCC">have when you buy your your your ring</font>

76
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:45,290
you get a first path and you get also a

77
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:48,050
protected path this theme on c2c both

78
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:52,880
legs go through the Luzon Strait same

79
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,560
for EAC and the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> for F now so what</font>

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,889
makes this straight so attractive to

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,680
cable builders well<font color="#E5E5E5"> really there's only</font>

82
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">three routes between Southeast Asia and</font>

84
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,169
Japan and Korea there is a Luzon Strait

85
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:12,740
which is 320<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometers wide and it also</font>

86
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:16,039
has a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good deep basin it's two</font>

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,320
point six<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometers there's also as a</font>

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,150
row going south of the Philippines so

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,849
you could circumvent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philippine and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">go between Philippine and Malaysia to</font>

91
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,979
reach southern Malaysia however this

92
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,260
adds a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of married mileage to the</font>

93
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:33,530
route hence latency for your backbone

94
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,270
and there's also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Formosa straight</font>

95
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,359
the Formosa straight is the strait

96
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,840
between China and Taiwan the<font color="#CCCCCC"> narrowest</font>

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,139
part is only 130 kilometers but it's

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,010
very very shallow water 70 meters deep

99
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:51,740
and the major cause of failures to cable

100
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,780
systems is fishing activities so it's

101
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">not your optimal path for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ferber</font>

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,719
requirements which are we want low

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:07,370
latency we also want the cables to live

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:10,700
very low there is not much<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternatives</font>

106
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,289

111
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:25,789
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the system suffered multiple</font>

112
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,080

113
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:29,060
cables

114
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,180
go through the Luzon Strait and<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven</font>

115
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,099
went down at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time and no cable</font>

116
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,610
was available to offer restoration

117
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:41,300
because all the others were down as well

118
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:44,060
so we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on cable repairs here</font>

119
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:48,050
I received this morning a beautiful map

120
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:52,789
from Darren of<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCCW we just volunteered</font>

121
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:55,490
this map here this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> seabed with</font>

122
00:06:52,789 --> 00:07:00,800
all the cable systems in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Luzon</font>

123
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:04,389

124
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,389
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be tricky where's my life</font>

125
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,390
whoopsie

126
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,360
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think I can blow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up babes</font>

127
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,190
you can wheel will it will it will be in

128
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,300
the side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can blow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up but you</font>

129
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:38,290
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how busy this 300 kilometers</font>

130
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,820
straight is and actually and there is a

131
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,130
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of islands that you can see there</font>

132
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,870
and you you probably wonder why it's all

133
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,740
at the northern part well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

134
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,450
the bashi channel and all cables go

135
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,580
there because it's the deepest part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

136
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:58,360
the straight so what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

137
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,840
backbone during the earthquake well the

138
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:06,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">X is pretty much show you what went down</font>

139
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:11,020
so there was not much left we had us a

140
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:15,250
to Tokyo but that was a dead stop the

141
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:21,460
Tokyo to Hong Kong was down um we had

142
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:27,250
hong kong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sorry singapore to palo</font>

143
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:30,840
alto via the bottom path it was very

144
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:35,080
very very gruesome so the remain

145
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,689
remaining cable routes were up to Tokyo

146
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:43,450
to see me we three from Hong Kong to

147
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:46,900
Malaya and also Singapore to Manila so

148
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,810
not your optimal thing so how do you

149
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,270
repair a subsea cable well first the

150
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,459
what you need to find is this the subsea

151
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:59,590
cable itself and cables are only 20

152
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:02,740
millimeters in that and i have this is a

153
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,450
subsea cable here so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what you</font>

154
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:11,910
need to retrieve at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

155
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:14,830
sea<font color="#E5E5E5"> four kilometers down and subsea</font>

156
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,829
cables have to lay at the bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

157
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,480
at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ocean and when you</font>

158
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an earthquake it displaces the</font>

159
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,660
cable it also uplifts some sediments

160
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,400
that can bury the cables so it makes the

161
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:33,130
searching party very difficult you can't

162
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,740
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a remotely operated vehicle at</font>

163
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,990
these depth because further down and to

164
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,720
kill

165
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:43,930
monitors your robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't work so you</font>

166
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:47,000
have to use a tried and tested technique

167
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:51,170
you need first you need to hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,600
cable ship repair and there's very few

169
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,240
of these cable ships like all cable

170
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,610
systems have cable ship repairs on hold

171
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,850
like ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a call but they all got</font>

172
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,800
the call at the same time you also need

173
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,290
your cable maps you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so rough</font>

174
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,589
weather and it's been very<font color="#CCCCCC"> rough in Asia</font>

175
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:14,420
lately and you need a grapnel and the

176
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:16,430
grad know is 24 inches by 18 and you

177
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,199
have to lower it down at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of</font>

178
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:24,199
the sea and then drag the bottom floor

179
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:28,670
hoist your cable and repair<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so i have</font>

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:32,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">this animation here to show you how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

181
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:35,380
done and this animation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i retrieved from</font>

183
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so first you're equipped</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with your</font>

184
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,800
map and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to go approximately</font>

185
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,800
where this cable should be if it wasn't

186
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,010
moved and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to go behind the</font>

187
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,910
fault retrieve<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to cut it then you</font>

188
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:04,460
pull it up then you put a boy on it then

189
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,900
they move your boat to further<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font>

190
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,230
your cable because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick it</font>

191
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:11,510
up be able to hoist<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up then you put</font>

192
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the new repair cabin you attach the two</font>

193
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,880
together and you lay you lay the pat

194
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,090
down so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see when you have a</font>

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,700
fault there and you've added a loop from

196
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:25,460
the seabed up to the surface you've

197
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,500
added probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's four kilometers</font>

198
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,460
down you've added eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometers of</font>

199
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,460
new cable to the system

200
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,109
you

201
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:51,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so how did it go back on December</font>

202
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:53,399
28 EAC got repaired although some

203
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:56,430
reports say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> EAC was not damaged it</font>

204
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,050
had suffered some damage a bit later but

205
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,739
that one was repaired I was the first

206
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:04,829
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be repaired then on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> January a</font>

207
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,889
second a very resource for people in our

208
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:10,079
company and they're in the room today

209
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:13,680
Annie and Luigi and the engineering team

210
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,779
they started to call up on our sister

211
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,939
company and said did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have assets</font>

212
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,189
that we can use what can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do can we</font>

213
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,310
restore on some of your existing

214
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:27,990
facilities so they went and set up to

215
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:31,170
layer to VPN tunnels through our sister

216
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,410
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> network one from Singapore to</font>

217
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:37,229
santa clara via chennai<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other</font>

218
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,259
one from<font color="#CCCCCC"> hong kong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to London so that</font>

219
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:43,259
brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> some relief not total relief but</font>

220
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:46,019
some relief then on january<font color="#E5E5E5"> second we</font>

221
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:48,660
regain partial backbone via china us so

222
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:53,459
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> hong kong a leaf logical route was</font>

223
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:56,969
restored and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on january 21 sorry 29</font>

224
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's sorry it's a PCN to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pc and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

225
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:04,430
was restored fully and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> regained</font>

226
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:07,469
the rest of our routes so on the 30th

227
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:11,489
everything was back in service so a

228
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,620
month later so there was just to give

229
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:17,550
you perspective there is 18 different

230
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:20,490
faults on these cable systems each fault

231
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:23,099
has to be repaired<font color="#E5E5E5"> by one ship you need</font>

232
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:26,189
to go find a fault pick up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cables so</font>

233
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,800
every repair on a segment takes seven

234
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:35,480
days so it's been around the clock

235
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:39,180
repair and then we got our backbone back

236
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,009
so what should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we learn from this given</font>

237
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,589
the Luzon Strait and given the economic

238
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:47,639
conditions can we build cables in that

239
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:49,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">area differently probably not unless we</font>

240
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,790
all collectively want to have more

241
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:55,570
little more latency for our traffic so

242
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,839
it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we have to go</font>

243
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">best and we have to go from Asia to</font>

244
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,150
Europe and we have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

245
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,370
route so there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

246
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,550
activities lately in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recent years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

247
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:11,770
you look in april two thousand two there

248
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,620
was a new cable laid the eye to eye

249
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:17,410
india to indonesia starting to go west

250
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:20,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the tata indicom between</font>

251
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,540
chennai<font color="#CCCCCC"> and singapore then there's been</font>

252
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,920
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> India to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sri Lanka Cable announced</font>

253
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:30,490
and see me we for became operational in

254
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:34,120
December 2005 and Falcon became

255
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:36,550
operational in September 2006 and

256
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,070
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more announcements because the</font>

257
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,709
demand the<font color="#CCCCCC"> India traffic and China</font>

258
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,850
traffic is really exploding so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

259
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:50,560
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of demand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the latency from</font>

260
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:53,170
Asia to Europe is much shorter if you go

261
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,989
west<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if you go through the Pacific</font>

262
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,990
around the US and across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlantic to</font>

263
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach Europe so it makes starts to make</font>

264
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:06,670
sense now and also in 2006 vsnl

265
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,699
announced another cable the<font color="#CCCCCC"> India to</font>

266
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:12,459
Europe cable anyway so there's been a

267
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:16,420
lot of announcements and activities but

268
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:18,580
these cables are not here today so I

269
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,790
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a designs you should probably</font>

270
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to circle your backbone make sure</font>

271
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,250
that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup your traffic from</font>

272
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the east from the west and not the think</font>

273
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,850
outside the box of it and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

274
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,450
really this should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this should be</font>

275
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:36,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">good for my network if I went west it</font>

276
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,830
probably won't be very cheap because

277
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,670
these will be new cables that's the

278
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:46,870
economics of new cables but probably

279
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:50,680
customers will demand that so there's

280
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,440
been also<font color="#E5E5E5"> three large projects across</font>

281
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pacific that's been announced and</font>

282
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,030
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this past month there's the</font>

283
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,050
trans-pacific<font color="#E5E5E5"> Express cable the flag and</font>

284

285
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,329
we tick because as I said before Japan

286
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,960
US and China us are full and the other

287
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,080
two networks are

288
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,810
