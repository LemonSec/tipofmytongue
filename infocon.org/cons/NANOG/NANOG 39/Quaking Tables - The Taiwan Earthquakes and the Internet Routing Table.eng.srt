00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,309
there's a lot of content in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk to</font>

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,420
so I was going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through it quickly</font>

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,018
but now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through it</font>

really quickly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is I'm Todd</font>

good layer one perspective which is

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,630
something i don't personally know

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,759
anything about and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was cool</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where we get our data and how</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks so the overview you guys know</font>

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,309
there was a quake people were on

23
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,870
stuff happened and you'll hear more

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,699
about it so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at this</font>

25
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,989
all from the perspective of the Internet

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,149
routing tables the thing I'll say about

27
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,890
this presentation is that it's very very

28
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,840
dense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to skim through it</font>

29
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,939
very very quickly and you'll see things

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">in there if you have any assets in the</font>

31
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,020
region or you operate networks with

32
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,460
people who do you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in there</font>

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,130
that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at in more detail</font>

34
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,259
it's all on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website presumably and</font>

35
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,520
you can go in and dig in and come find

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,140
me and ask me<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions later so there's</font>

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,229
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable Sylvia already covered</font>

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,710
this complete repairs for this maybe

39
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometime in February maybe march tough</font>

40
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,820
to say at this point Sylvia already

41
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,939
showed that animation so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

42
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,258
to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again oh my god the hell is</font>

43
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,500
this come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give some</font>

44
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,899
definitions of the terms that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be</font>

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,390
using to describe the sum of these seem

46
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,670
common sensical but in groups full of

47
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,530
smart people who run networks it's

48
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,920
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be clear about what we mean</font>

49
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a network outage as an</font>

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,990
outage for as when a route that

51
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,240
previously exists is withdrawn by some

52
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,689
large number of worldwide peers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

53
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,910
clarify that in a little bit if the

54
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,919
network is unreachable if there's no

55
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,220
less specific route so you can have an

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,929
outage for<font color="#CCCCCC"> more specific where the</font>

57
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,730
still traffic reach ability because

58
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,770
there's a covering less specific of some

59
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:23,179
sort the unstable networks this is a I

60
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,100
don't know why this causes so much

61
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,190
concern for people but we refer to

62
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,890
networks as being unstable when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

63
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,359
metric of instability which and I'll

64
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,739
explain the algorithm we use but it's

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,320
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> important it mirrors flap</font>

66
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,050
dampening so we give a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> a penalty</font>

67
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,150
when we see updates in BGP for it we

68
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,250
decay<font color="#CCCCCC"> that penalty over time and we</font>

69
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,320
chart the scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it to measure the</font>

70
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,180
instability charting instability and

71
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,130
just for occasionally people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

72
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,050
confused by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

73
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">are flap dampening it just means we're</font>

74
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,380
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the algorithm to chart instability</font>

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,090
it also doesn't mean a lot of other

76
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,859
people are flap dampening because many

77
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,970
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't do that anymore but</font>

78
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,850
it's a useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of charting</font>

79
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,490
instability so here's the rough timeline

80
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,739
and sylvie already went into this one of

81
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,310
the things that's interesting about this

82
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:13,790
timeline which you'll see in in future

83
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,550
slides is that the bulk of the routing

84
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,250
outages happen significantly after the

85
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,110
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> quake and I'd be interested in</font>

86
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,060
seismologists who are also network

87
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,800
engineers who understand submarine cable

88
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,400
systems explaining that to me because a

89
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,170
little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> puzzling so the</font>

90
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,300
timeline just going back so there's

91
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:37,250
these quakes<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 26</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at 12 26 was the</font>

92
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,280
biggest of the quakes and then there's a

93
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,350
number of aftershocks going on for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

94
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">next several days but most of them very</font>

95
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly thereafter the outage prefixes</font>

96
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:54,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">ramp up from about 400 into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1200 through</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventh quake by 331 on the</font>

00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">and suspiciously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean anybody who's</font>

100
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,840
ever done time analysis and ever

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,299
whenever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see something off by 60</font>

102
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,820
minutes you like I have committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

error in correcting daylight savings

104
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,630
somewhere right but we've double-checked

105
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,030
this and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact true almost</font>

106
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,548
exactly 60 minutes after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last quake</font>

107
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,310
see a huge spike in outages going up to

108
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">4,000 prefixes disappearing off the map</font>

about two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours later a couple thousand</font>

110
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,150
of them come back and then there's

111
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,430
there's messy recovery over the course

112
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,500
of

113
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,479
next several days but the instability

114
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,090
levels remain high and here's an

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,710
important point one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the suggestions</font>

116
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,719
that's been made to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font>

117
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,060
probably accurate is that the

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,389
instability is a reasonable marker for

119
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,460
serious congestion that that when you

120
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,770
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> people either route engineering</font>

121
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,719
around congestion or having so much

122
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,299
congestion into the region that they're

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,960
having bgp sessions drop which both of

124
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,940
which i heard anecdotes of then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,099
that that show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the routing tables</font>

126
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,060
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the form of a higher rate of updates</font>

127
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:04,650
for the affected prefixes so a note

128
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">about data collection infrastructure</font>

129

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,330
infrastructure similar to that that

131
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,419
route views are ripe operate the right

<font color="#CCCCCC">day SNS some ASNs are big and have</font>

135
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,560
regionally different routing and so we

136
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,669
collect full tables from them on

137
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,020
different continents where they have

<font color="#CCCCCC">different where they carry different</font>

139
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,539
full tables so what we do with these

140
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,740
routes is we we get full tables from

141
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,930
them which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit different I</font>

know ripe and route views get whatever

143
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,010
the carrier likes to set up so there's

144
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,139
some full tables and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of on</font>

145
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,090
net routes we get almost entirely full

147
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,979
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we store those for forever</font>

148
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,599

149
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,609
some other applications on top of them

150
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:57,479
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also do these sorts of analyses</font>

151
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:00,570
with them so Renesys<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been looking at</font>

natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> disasters human disasters from</font>

153
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,009
the perspective of the routing tables

154
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,250
for quite some time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadian I just</font>

155
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:12,479
said routing tables<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow it the connect</font>

156
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,759
accent they it's invasive so we've been

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,070
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the way these events show up</font>

158
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,930
in the routing tables for quite some

159
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,300
time and they generally have a very

160
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,849
distinct and very interesting signature

161
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,830
there's a very sharp<font color="#E5E5E5"> on set which</font>

162
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,620
corresponds<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the thing that did the</font>

163
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,479
badness and you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it in time</font>

164
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,830
and you can see oh look there's badness

165
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,889
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> examples and then</font>

166
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a return to baseline</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that covers</font>

167
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,330
the recovery depending on what type of

168
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,330
accident it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is or what type of disaster</font>

169
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,979
it is

170
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,169
power outages recover fairly quickly

171
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,940
natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> disasters that cause damage to</font>

172
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,430
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical infrastructure take</font>

173
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,920
longer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's usually noise in the</font>

174
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,790
in the recovery process but not in the

175
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,190
onset so some of you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2003</font>

176
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,260
massive power outages in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US well you</font>

177
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,420
look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean it's just what power</font>

178
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,610
went out all at<font color="#CCCCCC"> once and it goes</font>

179
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,280
straight up right not surprising and

180
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,560
this is actually charted by by type of

181
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,510
by size of prefix but you see the shape

182
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,280
it's very characteristic and you can see

183
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,310
a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messy recovery but it's fairly</font>

184
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,320
quick recovery of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and then</font>

185
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,320
some noise off to the side on both sides

186
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay fine um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hurricane Katrina when it</font>

187
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,740
hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Coast uh this looks like it</font>

188
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,080
is a little bit messy in the onset but

189
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,750
each color is actually prefixes

190
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,359
geo-located to one of the states so what

191
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,800
you actually see is a sharp onset per

192
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:44,060
state so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Louisiana</font>

193
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,000
in red rise sharply ahead of Mississippi

194
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,530
in blue in fact because Louisiana sticks

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,940
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Gulf slightly further than</font>

196
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,219
Mississippi and the hurricane hit

197
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,410
louisiana first so what you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

198
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,810
a compound event but<font color="#CCCCCC"> for each sub event</font>

199
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,760
for for each portion of the natural

200
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,560
disaster it's actually a sharp on set

201
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,900
and it has that characteristic<font color="#E5E5E5"> recovery</font>

202
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and here you see the long tail in fact</font>

203
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the recovery from Katrina</font>

204
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,960
probably will never be done it so it's

205
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,340
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say for an event that scope when</font>

206
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,460
you're done recovering and now when

207
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,400
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in a newly degraded state</font>

208
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,020
the pattern for the Taiwan quakes was

209
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,780
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different and really</font>

210
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,000
interesting to us there's a gradual

211
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,770
increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the number of outages after</font>

212
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,200
the major after but significantly after

213
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,210
the major quake on the 26th there's a

214
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,159
big spike on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the twenty-seventh which is</font>

215
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,079
an hour after one of the aftershocks

216
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,969
which is sort of interesting the

217
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,849
recovery is incredibly noisy and

218
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,620
continues and the pattern was probably

219
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:42,589
affected by the number of different

220
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,150
cable systems so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were tempted and I</font>

221
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,580
think the simplistic thing to think of

222
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,579
this as an event but much like the

223
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,510
Katrina situation it's more a compound

224
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:56,750
series of events so here are

225
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,420
outages and quakes outage prefixes

226
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,420
obeying the definition error 424 outages

227
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,400
previously are in blue and with the

228
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,560
magnitude on the left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the red lines</font>

229
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,510
are richter scale quakes with the

230
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">Richter scale on the right so you see</font>

231
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sharp sharp quakes back on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 26th</font>

232
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,530
and really no significant increase right

233
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,209
away in outages you see 34 aftershocks

234
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,550
after the fourth aftershock you see a

235
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,110
gradual increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> in outages of about</font>

236
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,520
eight hundred and then you see an

237
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,470
aftershock and then you see a small

238
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,870
delay and then a huge spike in outages

239
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,640
so from my perspective this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

240
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,370
interesting and somewhat puzzling

241
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,410
pattern on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 day just gives you a</font>

242
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,660
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more perspective that the</font>

243
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,150
recovery is messy and includes events in

244
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,430
the recovery outage events that are

245
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,199
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of you know certainly</font>

246
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,520
the scope of any of the outages that

247
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,250
were happening during the period of

248
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,380
quake so quite large and then you see

249
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,230
very messy recovery and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> return to</font>

250
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:59,090
normal ish levels of outages by the 31st

251
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:01,160
of December so uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the part that</font>

252
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,590
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skim through fairly quickly</font>

253
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,620
but there's a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

254
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,210
divide up these outage prefixes you can

255
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">assign them to the country you think</font>

256
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">they came from and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out to be</font>

257
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,850
interesting you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> assign them to the a</font>

258
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,530
s that originated them and that turns

259
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,840
out to be interesting and then you can

260
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,550
look at the edges the that are affected

261
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,810
by prefixes and that turns out to be one

262
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,069
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most interesting so I'll cover</font>

263
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,349
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one at the end of the</font>

264
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,620
presentation these are on the three HR

bottom in green<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is not</font>

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,380
that sort of maps with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> sylvie</font>

274
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,840
presented but the mainstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> press for</font>

275
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,250
some reason I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they they</font>

276
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,410
talked to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong people or drew the</font>

277
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,660
wrong conclusions somehow concluded that

278
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,069
India just escaped the outages because

279
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,300
India is India and<font color="#CCCCCC"> China's China and</font>

280
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,340

283
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,040
most of the connectivity to and from

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,060
India go

285
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,529
is through off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the east right and so</font>

286
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,660
one of the points that Sylvia was making

287
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,509
which is exactly right is that the major

288
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,519
bandwidth into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub-continent market</font>

289
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:21,649

290
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,139
you know Singapore Thailand is all

291
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,029
heading east not heading west and you

292
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:27,350
know this is historical accident from

293
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:28,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">the development of the internet and the</font>

294
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,449
fact that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is clearly the center</font>

295
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,220
of the world but aside from that it is

296
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:36,139
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> even though the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is the</font>

recently remembered this and are

<font color="#E5E5E5">we present this this chart going back</font>

303
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,079
for a second is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

304
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:53,630
know Indonesia India have significant

00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,250
outages here Hong Kong of course one of

306
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions I got going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over an</font>

earlier version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this presentation is</font>

308
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:02,569
you what about Taiwan wasn't this a

309
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,758
quake that hit Taiwan in Taiwan and

310
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:06,800
Taiwanese prefixes don't show up as

311
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,959
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> among the largest either by</font>

312
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,819
percentage of country prefixes or by

313
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,529
total count of prefixes in any of the

314
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,319
charts we did and I think there's two

315
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,029
explanations for that one is maybe we

316
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,380
just have mediocre geolocation that

317
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,000
there's a lot of prefixes that are

318
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,709
deployed in Taiwan that aren't

319
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,260
registered to Taiwan that we don't geo

320
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:26,388
locate to Taiwan so that's clearly part

321
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,189
of it but the second part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that</font>

322
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:30,170
Taiwan had a significant amount of

323
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,790
connectivity heading north off the north

324
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,949
part of Taiwan the problem was

325
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,250
everything south and east and south and

326
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:39,079
west of Taiwan so a lot of prefixes in

327
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,930
Taiwan were not in fact significantly

328
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:44,599
impacted the same chart but<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 day and</font>

329
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:47,589
you can see in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-day some</font>

330
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,750
significant although during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the event</font>

331
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:53,269
Indonesia wasn't as seriously impacted

332
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,800
after the 27th the pink towards the

333
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:57,949
bottom or magenta I'm sure that's

334
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,160
actually magenta the gets gets quite a

335
00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:03,079
bit larger in volume so interesting

336
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,880
stuff looking at one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things we</font>

337
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,729
wanted to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just zoom in on that big</font>

338
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,220
fork a prefix peak and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

339
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,920
4,000 prefixes out what the heck are

340
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,410
they well they're China you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know of</font>

341
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,540
course in green and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

342
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">India in blue and that's significant and</font>

343
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,180
a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Indonesian</font>

344
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,339
chunk of Hong Kong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

345
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of what you would expect these are</font>

346
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,180
the countries that are impacted in the

347
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,920
region the only thing that we saw that

348
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,719
was surprising just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the press</font>

349
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,430
had got it so wrong was that India was

350
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,589
substantially impacted and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

351
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,089
double checked and talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

352
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:39,230
operate networks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the region and of</font>

353
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:42,899
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was in fact the case um</font>

354
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,399
outages by origin asn so again charted

355
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,230
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three day period</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's</font>

356
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,959
originating these prefixes that are

357
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,730
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and here you see two things</font>

358
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,729
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you see you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are by a</font>

359
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,890
assigning you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Indian networks are</font>

360
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,209
some of the earliest impacted but the

361
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">other is one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that was</font>

362
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:02,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">troubling to us is that that onset was</font>

363
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,560
gradual and rough right I had talked

364
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the characteristic pattern of this</font>

365
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,880
sort of outage being sharp and when we

366
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,620
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the graphs nothing sharp about</font>

367
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,779
it but when you start to break it down

368
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,360
by country and you start to break it

369
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,950
down by origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s then you start to see</font>

370
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,190
the sharp pattern so here for example

371
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,690
using a messy rough on set but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

372
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,490
rough when you break it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down by origin</font>

373
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,860
ass these are individual networks

374
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,050
suffering individual outages that

375
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,470
stacked together form a very rough

376
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,510
pattern going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but individually each</font>

377
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,279
of them is a sharp onset and this gave

378
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,779
us a little bit more warm fuzzies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

379
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,959
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at good data and this</font>

380
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,899
does follow the characteristic pattern

381
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,369
the same perspective in the in the

382
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">10-day and one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see in</font>

383
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:50,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-day pattern is that after the</font>

384
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,899
bulk of the outages this big other the

385
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,670
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say yellow</font>

386
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's probably goldenrod sort of a</font>

387
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,189
color there just gets larger and so what

388
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,860
that means is that there were a few big

389
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,810
people hit significantly early on and

390
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,339
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the damage spread to everyone</font>

391
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,380
throughout the region presumably as

392
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,060
people started spying and stealing

393
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,890
transit from each other and finding any

394
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:15,000
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of East Asia and Southeast Asia</font>

395
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:17,579
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could outages by origin asn at</font>

396
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,100
the peak in its as you would expect

397
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:22,829
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's much much higher</font>

398
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,199
prevalence of Indian I asses than than

399
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,029
people thought so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show some</font>

400
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,740
instability metrics the instability

401
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,630
algorithm we use was described in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

402
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,030
previous paper we gave it's basically

403
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,590
flap dampening where you you know

404
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,150
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you assign a penalty and then you</font>

405
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,800
decay<font color="#CCCCCC"> that penalty over time and it's</font>

406
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,590
useful way of tracking the level of

407
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,160
stability for a prefix here you see

408
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:46,650
significant increase in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> instability</font>

409
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,910
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefixes the spike is not surprising</font>

410
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,920
because one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

411
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">when prefixes are fully withdrawn is</font>

412
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,430
that they go through all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup</font>

413
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,410
paths each of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an announcement</font>

414
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,479
so if there are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm aware of</font>

415
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,730
15 ways to get to a prefix and the

416
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,400
prefix is completely withdrawn I'm going

417
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get 15 announcements for each of</font>

418
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,310
those backup house before I finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

419
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,950
the withdrawal and say look<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

420
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:10,589
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> left it's gone so you do</font>

421
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,840
see when you see significant outages and

422
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,000
the instability patterns track roughly

423
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,030
with the outage patterns when you break

424
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,950
them down by country they track to some

425
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,230
extent although Indonesia crops up as

426
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,940
having significantly higher instability

427
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,250
so Indonesia was previously showing up

428
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,290
as sort of a significant but not the

429
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,450
main story in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of outages but now</font>

430
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:34,230
in terms of instability<font color="#CCCCCC"> there one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

431
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,420
major players here again looking through

432
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,650
the peak we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look through that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I say</font>

433
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,140
look through the peak this obviously

434
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,569
isn't a single peak but this is the

435
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,210
period of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that had that peak of</font>

436
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:48,060
outages the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4000 prefixes that were out</font>

437
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,890
and you look at the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> instability by</font>

438
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,750
that peak and you can see who

439
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,689
contributed to the significant amount of

440
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,760
updates during that period unstable is

441
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,040
broken down by origin asn<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll let you</font>

442
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,220
guys look through these including the

443
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,619
peak so everybody loves a who won and

444
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,030
who lost set of stories so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

445
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,379
probably the the part of this

446
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,599
presentation that people are most

447
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,360
interested in this is the who won and

448
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,740
who lost and interesting anecdotes and I

449
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,439
know that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really what people</font>

450
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:20,280
want as opposed to the data so we use

451
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:24,090
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this metric which is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maximum</font>

452
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,220
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of outages / the median number of</font>

453
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,929
outages during the time period and the

454
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,350
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's interesting is that there</font>

455
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,670
is an underlying level of outages in in

456
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:36,030
the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> period that we looked at which</font>

457
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:38,100
was from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 25th of december</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

458
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,740
the 15th of january so it's a good solid

459
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,469
time period and we figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ratio of</font>

460
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,300
the maximum<font color="#E5E5E5"> instantaneous outage / the</font>

461
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,800
median would give you a good ratio of

462
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,560
who was most significantly

463
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,820
impacted so not surprisingly china and

464
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">hong kong in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the region were most</font>

465
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,860
significantly impacted Korea Japan and

466
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:59,400
Malaysia were least we break down this

467
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,290
ratio here by country so the max /

468
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,110
median and you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hong Kong Taiwan</font>

469
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:07,710
Indonesia as being the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most seriously</font>

470
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:10,709
impacted and scrolling down and maximum

471
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,900
/ median instabilities here China stands

472
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,060
out as just having when looking at the

473
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">maximum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of prefixes that are</font>

474
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:22,490
unstable with an instability metric of 3

475
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,990
or higher / the median in that china is

476
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,510
head and shoulders above<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest now</font>

477
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not corrected for this is this</font>

478
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:34,200
is a count of prefixes not a percentage

479
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,570
originated by that country so one

480
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,250
argument here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well China you</font>

481
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:43,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know has a lot more prefixes than a lot</font>

482
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:45,180
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these countries so impacted ASNs some</font>

483
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,459
of the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories were a SNS and I</font>

484
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,930
mean is I sort of know a lot of a SNS

485
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,370
just off the top of my head<font color="#E5E5E5"> from doing</font>

486
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,260
this for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while but a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

487
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">asin's I just didn't know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

488
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,430
familiar with and to have such

489
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,950
significant impact so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> China</font>

490
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">Telecom was obviously seriously impacted</font>

491
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:06,150
not surprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> SiFi in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> India huge impact</font>

492
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:10,440
the SNL Sylvia<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to Sylvie talked</font>

493
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:13,830
about significant impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bharti and so</font>

494
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,590
on so these are listed here winners and

495
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,000
losers by asn this is by number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

496
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,699
prefixes and then corrected for

497
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,710
percentage of total prefixes so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

498
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,020
what's interesting about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

499
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,670
story here the story here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is</font>

500
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,400
more on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right than it is on the left</font>

501
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,650
so on the left you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so China</font>

502
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,020
Telecom really significant impact huge

503
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,880
numbers of prefixes that were impacted

504
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,710
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this event you know over a thousand</font>

505
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,840
but once it's corrected for percentage

506
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,580
of prefixes originated or transited well

507
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,100
now all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sudden you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

508
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,320
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> range so this was a broad</font>

509
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,709
regional event and pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

510
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,939
got screwed one way or another you're

511
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,690
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm pub on</font>

512
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,030
sorry so so here's the here's the edge

513
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,760
analysis and this is the stuff I find

514
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,700
most interesting so when I refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

515
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,050
edge you know again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Renesys so</font>

516
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,170
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in terms of the autonomous</font>

517
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:11,190
system graph so when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of an edge</font>

518
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adjacency between two any</font>

519
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,570
two autonomous systems so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

520
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,370
about the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as a fully</font>

521
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,710
hopefully fully connected graph of

522
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,659
autonomous systems then the edge between

523
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,850
any two a SS can have you know any

524
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,770
number of physical adjacencies but it

525
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,340
just refers to the routing adjacency

526
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:31,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">logically between those two so we do two</font>

527
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,020
things so we track all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefixes</font>

528
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,150
on all of the edges of the internet all

529
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,950
the time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we calculate two metrics on</font>

530
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,360
those one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as a metric you guys</font>

531
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,880
are all familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font>

532
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,830
carried prefixes which is you know how

533
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,110
many prefixes are carried on that edge

534
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,610
if you're on one side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that edge you</font>

535
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,139
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as how many prefixes</font>

536
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,020
you announce and how many prefixes that

537
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,640
person announces to you once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

538
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,320
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the route selection process and</font>

539
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,750
actually choose to use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those so</font>

540
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense the one that we</font>

541
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,960
calculate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives a little bit</font>

542
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,909
different in it an interesting story is

543
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,340
what we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> pbt which is prefixed by</font>

544
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,230
pier by time so again we've got these

545
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,169
hundred and sixty odd peering sessions

546
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,180
and we're storing every routing update

547
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,590
for all time and there's prefixes

548
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,040
carried on these events so what we do is

549
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:19,260
we multiply each prefix by the number of

550
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,270
peers who selected that prefix on that

551
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,220
edge by the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of seconds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

552
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,590
carried on that edge and it gives you a

553
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,930
metric of the overall weight of that

554
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,659
edge the good thing is that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

555
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,610
distinguish between oh you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

556
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,170
a peer who has transit from sprint and

557
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,969
sees<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet through sprint</font>

558
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,950
that's going to look on a prefixes

559
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,010
perspective like oh here's an edge that

560
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">carries you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know whatever 209,000</font>

561
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,270
prefixes but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at it in ppt</font>

562
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,850
you're going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that almost nobody</font>

563
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,920
selects almost any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those prefixes for</font>

564
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,209
any significant period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

565
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,810
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sudden it becomes a minor edge</font>

566
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:57,120
again the two caveats here are that you

567
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,350
cannot all prefixes have the same weight

568
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,489
so at this point we're not going to

569
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,850
correct for the difference between

570
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,070
carrying a / 11 and carrying a / 24

571
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,810
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a prefix for now and you</font>

572
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">still get interesting results although</font>

573
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,320
there's some degenerate cases and then

574
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,820
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other is that it's you can't tell</font>

575
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,908
exactly the difference between

576
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,279
an edge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peers seeing an</font>

577
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:20,019
enormous number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of prefixes versus an</font>

peers seeing a medium-sized number of

580
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,230
prefixes those will even out so it's

581
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,230
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the two metrics at</font>

582
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,480
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so for each edge we</font>

583
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,669
generate a time series with a range you

only<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider prefixes from Southeast</font>

588
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:44,440
Asian the Indian subcontinent we

589
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,029
filtered out all edges seen by fewer

590
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,259
than 20 peers not because those aren't

591
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:49,179
interesting but because they're probably

592
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:53,139
not globally significant if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

you know 19 of them view a particular

599
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,928
these are edges on the internet that saw

600
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,209
significant increase in the weight of

601
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,279
them by this ppt<font color="#CCCCCC"> metric</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what that</font>

602
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,379
means is either significantly more

603
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,509
prefixes or significantly more peers

604
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:22,230
selecting more prefixes for more time

605
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:26,559
and here the thing that stands out is

606
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:29,950
sprint it picks up quite a few prefixes

607
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hearty 94-98 relief that is but</font>

608
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:35,139
the real story which isn't surprising

609
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:39,370
giving the geography of the situation is

610
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:41,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">that large and very large European</font>

611
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,840
carriers pick up significant transit

612
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,720
into the region not surprisingly so if

613
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,668
you are a medium<font color="#E5E5E5"> sized or large European</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Network likes a telecom italia our cable</font>

618
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:57,610
but you've got capacity all of a sudden

622
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:06,159
go through a couple examples of that the

623
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:08,259
top edge losers interestingly almost all

624
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:12,399
of the top edge losers are out of

625
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:13,960
Singapore so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

626
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:16,268
has to do with the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Singapore</font>

627
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,669
had some options because there was cable

the edge losers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> singtel to US</font>

647
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:06,240
given the cable maps and what what

<font color="#E5E5E5">sylvie presented so I'm guessing they</font>

just use the capacity for something else

650
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,279
so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some interesting regional</font>

stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> tsingtao china telecom and we'll</font>

653
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,980
you see in each of these and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll only</font>

654
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,919
go through a couple of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in detail</font>

655
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">but in each of these you're going to see</font>

656
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,809
on the top the ppt scores and on the

657
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:30,240
bottom the number of prefixes carried on

658
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:32,309
that edge the reason that's interesting

659
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,559
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> appears in this graph so if you</font>

outages about the quake modest ppt score

666
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:53,330
and then a sharp spike which means that

667
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:56,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">a significantly larger number of peers</font>

right basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge became</font>

00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:13,110
thought it was around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3,800 prefixes it</font>

00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:23,299
just south of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 so half as many</font>

678
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:26,220

pure prefix seconds selected on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edge</font>

680
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,850
well what happened was that was

681
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">appearing edge which meant that they had</font>

682
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,840
all the on that prefixes advertised but

683
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,840
it wasn't transit and so it's the only

684
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,879
people who were on only<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers of mine</font>

685
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,299
who are down the streams of Telecom

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,769
Italia

687
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">telecom italia themselves would have</font>

688
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:44,070
selected that edge because it was

689
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,539
appearing edge it was you know

690
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,789
settlement free<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter connection that</font>

691
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,460
wasn't advertised to all the other

692
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,440
trances once you start propagating that

693
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,720
edges transit they clearly agreed to

694
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,460
accept fewer prefixes presumably for

695
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,529
capacity reasons that they couldn't take

696
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,210
all the traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would get if</font>

697
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:02,639
they would accept all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SingTel's on</font>

698
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,279
net prefixes but a significantly larger

699
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:07,439
amount of traffic and so here we see ppt

700
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,950
as a reasonable stand-in for traffic

701
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,700
other stories in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are mirror similar</font>

702
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:18,299
sorts of events so yeah so the cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

703
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:21,629
wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> singtel really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a edge</font>

704
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:23,220
appears from basically nothing comes up

705
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:25,889
with a small number of prefixes but a

706
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,159
significant amount of ppt of pure prefix

707
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:32,158
time so interesting stories there china

708
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:34,679
telecom noisy and interesting the

709
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,419
biggest story that we saw that that is

710
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,100
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here is that the edge</font>

711
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:43,049
between china telecom and sprint goes to

712
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,330
basically nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now the best path</font>

713
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:48,869
to china telecom from sprint turns out

714
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,549
to be through to moi and<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-net it it</font>

715
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:52,439
what's what's odd to me is and I don't

716
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand sort of the sometimes the</font>

717
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,149

sort more of a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> one capacity issue</font>

that they find someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> with routing</font>

814
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:44,039
think realists among us know this is

and there are obviously economic and

826
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:10,859
development reasons why people did that

827
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:13,109
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um physical failures the</font>

828
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:15,389
reason this event struck our interest is

829
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:17,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">that physical fail users are supposed to</font>

830
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:19,320
be the trivial failures that you know

<font color="#CCCCCC">layer three IP just routes around and</font>

832

<font color="#E5E5E5">lose enough physical capacity especially</font>

840
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:41,580
interesting from a routing perspective

841
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:43,710
and from a business perspective looking

842
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:47,218
forward into the next five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years</font>

843
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:49,589
because this will give rise<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a new a</font>

844
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:51,450
renewed interest in solving some of the

fundamental connectivity problems into

846
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,769
and out of East Asia so new cable

847
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:58,549
systems that Sylvie talked about new

848
00:32:55,769 --> 00:33:00,980
interest in redundancy so thank you

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,290
heard you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say this that there seems to</font>

855
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:26,299
be a fair amount of cooperation among

was there was a lot of that so what

869
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,590
didn't really matter how much sharing

870
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:59,090
there was but basically lots of stuff

873
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,480
outside of Portland's big industrial

874

those cables through the Luzon Strait

may look cheap in the short term<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,440
Sylvia I'd be interested if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font>

891
00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:01,910
early on about the time delays I've done

892
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,830
geophysics in the past and I know that

893
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,649
undersea landslides are actually fairly

894
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,500
slow and undersea landslides<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause most</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of these breakages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 meters a second</font>

896
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,880
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a fairly fast undersea</font>

897
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,640

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,099
kilometers

902
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,410
correlate well maybe Sylvia could do

903
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,660
this best where the breakages are when

904
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,940
they occurred and you might even see the

905
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,279
thing just propagate along the bottom

906
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,140
and my colleague Earl will feel

907
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:35,369
justified because he was telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font>

908
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just the painfully obvious</font>

909
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:39,539
explanation and I was being an idiot for

had the timeline for the earthquakes and

the outages when were the actual cable

919
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,980
those I have a sensor net of routers not

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> following up on Marshalls</font>

927
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,279
comment and yours is precisely to this

928
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,379
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well there are if you search hard</font>

929
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:28,799
some published outages of the precise

930
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:32,130
time and cable breakage and they don't

931
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:33,599
correlate with the a major quake and

932
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,460
then the seven after quakes there is a

933
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,910
sizable gap and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of curious</font>

934
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,769
as to why they weren't correlated and

935
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,779
then Marshall said well an actual fact

936
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:44,609
you don't quite expect that you get an

937
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:46,589
undersea quake moving at 50 meters per

938
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:49,348
second and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlate that with</font>

942
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,849
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you did do the geography</font>

943
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:58,920
and the timings you could actually find

944
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:02,029
which way the landslides were running

945
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,309
what I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that the BGP mess</font>

946
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:07,410
wasn't tightly correlated to the precise

947
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:10,349
times that the outages were reported and

948
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,058
there seemed to be a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

keep alive a certain amount of people

950
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:16,829
hanging on two outs and there weren't

951
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:19,649
obvious spikes that precisely correlated

952
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:21,480
to the noted time that the cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> snapped</font>

953
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,920
it was a little bit messier than that

954
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,100
that's what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where I'm</font>

965
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,000

00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,780
different snap events as todd has said

969
00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:01,120
so he's our goal we looking on all sides

shadows of that event depending on how

bgp is propagating at you and that's

what makes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp analysis so</font>

978
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,360
although we have lots of peering I don't

979
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,830
have nearly as much East Asian peering

980
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,960
as I'd like so if there are people here

who operate networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> East Asia or in</font>

the subcontinent or in Southeast Asia
