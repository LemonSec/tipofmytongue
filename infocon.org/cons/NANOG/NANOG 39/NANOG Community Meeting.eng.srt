76
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,220
read the Charter to the new charter

77
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,470
which incorporates the new text there

78
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,180
was one sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of direct impact in terms</font>

79
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,780
of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in these various</font>

80
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:31,070

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,330
SCP see overlap prohibition there was

82
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing in the Charter beforehand that</font>

83
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,810
said he couldn't be on both committees

84
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,040
and in fact there were three<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us I</font>

85
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,209
think to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with that were on both</font>

86
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,519
committees bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> Norton and I decided not</font>

87
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,590
to stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the pc is that how it</font>

88
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,000
worked I forget well we removed

89
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,820
ourselves from the nomination process

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,370
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC anyway and that left Chris</font>

91
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,010
and Chris found himself on both the pc

92
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,890
and the SC and he decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resign from</font>

93
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,149
the pc so that he could stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the SC</font>

94
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,458
so and late the balance of nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

95
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:06,590
restored<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody smiled smiled</font>

previously the mailing list was kind of

119
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,910
an oddity it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sort of</font>

120
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,440
considered in the same way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

121
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,480
program committee was as far as the

122
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,550
Charter was concerned and while the

123
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,090
steering committee has the chair of the

124
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,930
program committee sitting ex officio to

participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various discussions</font>

126
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,770
that the steering committee has the

127
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,120
mailing list didn't and a few of us felt

128
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,560
that that caused some communication

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,620
problems between the mailing list admin

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,660
team and the steering<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee so we</font>

131
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,600
fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we think by adding by</font>

132
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,310
inviting<font color="#CCCCCC"> rob c strim to to our bi-weekly</font>

he has direct access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all our</font>

136
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,750
conversations that go on when the SC

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,090
meets apart from it meetings like this

138
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,910
one it's always almost always by email

139
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,280
and phone so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't for the fact that</font>

140
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,510
we had that sort of overlap is it's more

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,820
remember Randy thinks this was announced

144
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,119
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the last NOC meeting but</font>

145
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,370
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure but if anybody missed it an</font>

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,890

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,280
accepting all the applications and

157
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,530
things like that and and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

158
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,140
summarizing the the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> as per the</font>

159
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,000
rest of the SC so the SC still makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

160
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,400
decision and then nano can learn

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,500
together if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the final decision</font>

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,549
for who gets the to come to the to the

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">joint meeting and be paid for</font>

164
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,150
we increased the meeting feeds by

165
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,440
hundred dollars this is the point where

166
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:49,090
one's really supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get angry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

167
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:57,350
shouting things it was very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quiet</font>

168
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:59,060
so it's so apart from that we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

169
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought we heard in previous community</font>

170
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,150
meetings like this one that the

171
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,190
important things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people who travel to</font>

172
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,690
nanog were making sure that the price

173
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,160
per night of the hotel was under control

174
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">because people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have corporate travel</font>

175
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,360
policies they can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> expense so much</font>

176
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,860
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that location was sensible</font>

177
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,470
it wasn't too hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to didn't have</font>

178
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,880
to hop through nine airports to reach it

179
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,740
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard was that the</font>

180
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,780
meeting fee was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low compared</font>

181
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,770
to comparable events elsewhere and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

182
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,869
were to increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting fee</font>

183
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,969
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that help with this shortfall</font>

184
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,140
and funds in the nanog budget that we'd

185
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,180
be talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last few</font>

186
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,070
meetings so we went ahead and

187
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,690
implemented this as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-term measure</font>

188
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,540
to restore some of the buoyancy to the

189
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,130
Nano accounts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit whilst obviously</font>

190
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,200
still pursuing other ways to increase

191
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,100
sponsorship revenue and other ways to

192
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,469
make the books balanced so does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

193
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,550
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying anything does anybody</font>

194
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,070
so I guess you are here so you obviously

195
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,090
paid the extra money is<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody does</font>

196
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,920
anybody hear of anybody else you

197
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:57,140
specifically didn't come because the

198
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:59,890
meeting fee was higher does anybody have

199
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,330
any opinions about about this at all

200
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:06,830
maybe we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just double it what do</font>

201
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:09,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think well it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem like it's</font>

202
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,120
very contentious today there was a bit

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of traffic on the mailing lists and one</font>

204
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,640
of the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people asked was</font>

205
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,780
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we getting for our money what</font>

206
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,419
do we get for our extra hundred bucks

207
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,219
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked very</font>

208
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,720
hard to do is to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and push out the</font>

209
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,090
schedule of nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings so that for</font>

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,680
example we're aiming so that you will

211
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,140
know exactly where every nano meeting

212
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,400
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 months out at any time that's</font>

213
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,760
our goal we're not we're not quite there

214
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,520
yet I think Betty's going to talk if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

215
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,530
today then probably at some other point

216
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,260
during the meeting about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the venues for</font>

217
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next two meetings so we're getting</font>

218
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,220
close but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another almost</font>

219
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-thirds of a year's worth of meetings</font>

220
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,740
but if anybody has strong opinions about

221
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,970
other things they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be</font>

222
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,200
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> better I know a lot of people are</font>

223
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:57,700
new here so it's a hard question to

224
00:08:50,200 --> 00:09:00,690
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move on and there</font>

225
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,310
was a reorg at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not so long ago</font>

226
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,870
various people who have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar to</font>

227
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,160
nano attendees were shifted around

228
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,380
within merit to have slightly different

229
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,910
roles departments were realigned

230
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,189
everyone is familiar with this corporate

231
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,280
process I'm sure and after that happened

232
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,170
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done and I had a conversation</font>

233
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,660
to try and just confirm merits roll with

234
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,780
nanog and to and to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

235
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,760
merit board was fully fully admitted to

236
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,040
hosting now log in a into the future and

237
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,350
I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> pleased to say that that indeed</font>

238
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,120
was the confirmation i got merits very

239
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,620
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about continuing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hearst nanog</font>

240
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
they want they're planning to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

241
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,310
people to nanog and in fact they're

242
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,930
they're drawing on the experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

243
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,640
they've gained through<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nan up</font>

244
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,410
meetings and logistics and hotel

245
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,760
conferences and things and they're

246
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,579
trying to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that expertise and use it</font>

247
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">for other programs as well so this all</font>

248
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,750
bodes well for nanog this all this all

249
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,610
sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a long future</font>

250
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,130
commitment to the meeting hosting and

251
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,270
the administrative support for nanog so

252
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,860
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to have that confirmation is</font>

253
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">done here he's flying in tomorrow I</font>

285
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,280

290
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,780
mistakes of mine but the program is uh

291
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,310
put together by a lot of choir to work

292
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,510
from a lot of volunteers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program</font>

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,189
committee and of course everybody who

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:11,050

<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned the steering committee selects</font>

299
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,650

with one<font color="#CCCCCC"> exception and as the merit</font>

301
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,370

members Igor<font color="#E5E5E5"> cubby Mike Ethan Richard</font>

303
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:32,650
replacing the five members<font color="#E5E5E5"> who retired</font>

304
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:34,750
since then Joe and Chris of course have

305
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:39,280
moved on to be full-time on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> steering</font>

306
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:42,970
committee Kevin Hank and dave also have

307
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,350
got on to other things but they all put

308
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,770
in a lot of work and of course thank

309
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:50,470
them this program this is where I kind

310
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:53,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of fell down we had 43 submissions this</font>

311
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:57,520
time and that does not include a small

312
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,590
handful that I got after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the formal call</font>

313
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,710
had expired and people send email and

314
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,210
ask can I be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if a few</font>

315
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,350
cases i was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yes but it most</font>

316
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,510
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them i have to say no sorry we're</font>

317
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,840
full so the real numbers probably closer

318
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,830
to 45 46 but the important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

319
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,600
notice is that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> number is</font>

320
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,890
substantially higher than though for the

321
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,890
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting where we all had 32</font>

322
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:21,069
submissions<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again thank you everybody</font>

323
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,420
who submitted keep up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good work the</font>

324
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,460
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's different this time</font>

325
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,040
is that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an actual</font>

326
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,209
keynote speaker<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tuesday morning somebody</font>

327
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we haven't invited to come in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

328
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,868
and this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an experiment we've</font>

329
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,759
never done a keynote like this before

330
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:36,740
we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's popular</font>

331
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,509
and if so we'll keep trying to find a

332
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,389
new interesting entertaining people to

333
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:42,290
come and talk to us so that's something

334
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:44,059
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if there's a survey</font>

335
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,290
question about it or not but if there

336
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:46,610
isn't please write it in or just tell us

337
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the hallways whether you think this</font>

338
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,769
keynote thing is a good idea because

339
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's all we'd like to keep it up oh and</font>

340
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,329
of course my promise from before is I'm

341
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to put together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a report with</font>

342
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:59,719
actual numbers of how many were

343
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:03,050
submitted and how many were accepted in

344
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,490
various categories and things one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

345
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,589
things that people said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in the</font>

346
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,850
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the program committee kind</font>

347
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:09,649
of works behind closed doors and doesn't

348
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,079
tell us much about what's going on what

349
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:15,889
we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the parts going to be an</font>

350
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,050
attempt to alleviate that help people be

351
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:21,470
less concerned that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just inviting</font>

352
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,389
our friends to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever program</font>

353
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,819
format we're back to the sunday through

354
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,170
wednesday format which has been quite

355
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:29,240
successful since we needed to do to

356
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,509
about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year ago more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year ago</font>

357
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,089
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in fact people missed it at the</font>

358
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:37,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">last meeting the joint meeting with Erin</font>

359
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:40,670
because Aaron takes up Wednesday through

360
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:42,170
Friday those weeks so when I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

361
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,529
what the schedule is I've mentioned it

362
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,849
before nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> unusual about that we're</font>

363
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,679
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk with air in a bit and see</font>

364
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,829
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can find a way better integrating</font>

365
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:54,170
the two meetings has some ideas on the

366
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:56,929
table about that so that we don't have

367
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">to feel as a brushed and that there can</font>

368
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,889
be more joint interaction between the

369
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:03,470
two sets of attendees who really are one

370
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:08,329
group in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases there's a lot of</font>

371
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:11,809
crossover between<font color="#CCCCCC"> you two and then a</font>

about the program about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we</font>

375
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:19,970
operate what we could do better how

376
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:22,339
maybe even if we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good job we'd</font>

broadcasters oh and I see Bill standing

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:29,750
at a microphone hey Steve one thing I

403
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,079
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I didn't quite make</font>

404
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:35,899
it out you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to provide</font>

405
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:38,750
greater transparency by documenting in

406
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:41,930
some fashion the activities of the

407
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:44,509
program committee is did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that I</font>

408
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I applied it i don't think i was</font>

409
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:47,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">very specific about what i meant by it</font>

410
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,139
but what I basically wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is put</font>

411
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">out like a one-page report going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to more</font>

412
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,930
detail about the numbers of submissions

413
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:58,969
and number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of acceptances what</font>

414
00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:01,519
categories they were in possibly where I

415
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,769
can without violating privacy talking

416
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,040
about why things that weren't accepted

417
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:08,000
weren't accepted I will say though one

418
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened this</font>

419
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,900
time is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually had to reject a</font>

420
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,240
few that were otherwise quite acceptable

421
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,040
but we just didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for and I</font>

422
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,679
mean for those of you who got rejected

423
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,970
for that reason sorry but from a program

424
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,280
in each point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> view it's nice to be in</font>

425
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that situation it means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the over</font>

426
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,980
quality sire but that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

427
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,570
thing I want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I'll probably</font>

428
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,360
go out into a little detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

429
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,939
conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> calls we had and maybe who</font>

430
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,580
attended that sort of thing I guess some

431
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,370
of the information that I as a community

432
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,970
person would like to know is how many

433
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:47,149
calls were there who showed up to the

434
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:50,360
call how long were the calls how many

435
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,400
submissions did you look at in each one

436
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,979
of the iterations because I understand

437
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,010
you do a few iterations maybe two

438
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,290
with three how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it come</font>

439
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,200
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you saying okay I'm going to</font>

440
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,809
accept these three presentations because

441
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,179
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to and it's my prerogative</font>

442
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:12,530
the kind of stuff I used to do way back

443
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:14,690
way back when I guess is it important to

444
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,970
I think for feedback to the community

445
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,440
for for those whose talk was not

446
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:23,030
accepted for us to all understand why

447
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,120
what we can do differently next time and

448
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:29,230
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is when you know there</font>

449
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:32,510
are 16 I think members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pc right</font>

450
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:35,780
17 17 members of pc that in theory

451
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,240
should give us a great distribution of

452
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,330
tentacles across a wide range of

453
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,340
different parts of this community so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

454
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,659
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be very valuable to know are</font>

455
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,870
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually going out and</font>

456
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,620
beating the bushes and coming back with

457
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:53,928
interesting talks themselves if they are

458
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'd love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see their names tagged with</font>

459
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,280
this talk brought to you by red provo or

460
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,780
this this knocking brought to you by

461
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,580
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> two people that kind of stuff</font>

462
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,500
because that says to us that these

463
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,850
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are busting their butts as</font>

464
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,230
volunteers to this community<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay bunch</font>

465
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,668
of suggestions ya done what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

466
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,720
suggestions are good the last one is

467
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:14,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be hard because I just don't</font>

468
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the data there other than my faulty</font>

469
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,980
memory so not much I can do there i also

470
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to mention though that i don't</font>

471
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,980
expect everybody on the pc to be at

472
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,750
recruiting talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think different</font>

473
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,309
members of the pc have different

474
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,380
strengths and areas and one of the

475
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:29,990
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for having a fairly large bc is</font>

476
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,140
so that we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of the</font>

477
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,880
strengths of each person as because

478
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,070
they're individuals so some are good at

479
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,059
reviewing some are<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at recruiting</font>

480
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,970
some are<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at both and those things</font>

481
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,260
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so we taking advantage</font>

482
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,350
of people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

483
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,690
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a pretty broad diversity of</font>

484
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,070
areas of expertise so every talk that

485
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,910
comes in that's relevant can be reviewed

486
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">by somebody who knows what they're</font>

487
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:57,530
talking about Joel Joel yay glee I'm a

488
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,419
member of the pc<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

489
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:03,918
an absurd servation that one of the

490
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:05,750
reasons i got on the pc you know had to

491
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,530
do with my complaints about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quality</font>

492
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,380
of the program

493
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:12,020
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

494
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,670
observe having now been on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pc is</font>

495
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,730
that it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hard to</font>

496
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:18,050
recruit talks for nanog there are many

497
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in the audience who are not</font>

498
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:23,270
willing to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> their experiences I</font>

499
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,190
mean in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that amounts to</font>

500
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:30,650
running your underwear up a flag pole so

501
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:32,390
I can understand that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually</font>

502
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in a situation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we have</font>

503
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:40,610
talks that we can reject not because

504
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,790
they're bad but because our program is

505
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,770
full we are in a situation where it was

506
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:48,080
for a while where it was very hard to

507
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">get talks at all and so filling the</font>

508
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,699
program was challenging you know which

509
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,409
has deep implications for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font>

510
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,070
quality of the material that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

511
00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:01,490
because you know if you have 18 slots

512
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:12,010
and you have 16 talks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you have</font>

513
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:14,660
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem rend I'm not quite that tall</font>

514
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:17,300
another observation many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

515
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,970
receive a conditional approval do not

516
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:23,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">submit the final set of slides until the</font>

517
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,980
very end so if folks are receiving a

518
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,510
conditional approval if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

519
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,700
the minor adjustments it would help

520
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,379
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> and especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve with</font>

521
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,260
planning out the time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

522
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda is as jam-packed as it can be</font>

523
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,700
and i will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tutorials</font>

524
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,919
i tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get almost a year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago is</font>

525
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,350
finally on the agenda here and that was

526
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,810
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of time space the speaker's</font>

527
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,149
ability to travel it's not always desire

528
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:50,149
that is holding back some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

529
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,980
presentations a lot of its timing so

530
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,350
please keep submitting even if you are

531
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,000
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepted right away please keep</font>

532
00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:00,730
submitting each time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do better we've</font>

533
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,120
seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last year or two thanks</font>

534
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:07,880
sure hey rent before you disappear does

535
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,459
it make any sense at all to use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> form</font>

536
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this to get ideas for what</font>

537
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,890
community wants to hear about to somehow

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,390
poll the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> for topics that would</font>

539
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,860
be of interest to hear about wouldn't

540
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,990
nanog futures be a better forum

541
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,909
how successful has that been today I

542
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,170
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've seen a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things added</font>

543
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,030
to the agenda that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were mentioned on</font>

544
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:31,860
nanog futures is having been missing

545
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:33,960

546
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,399
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why doing here might not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

547
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,620
best ideas I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have anybody taking</font>

642
00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:03,080
looked at the AUP there are seven major

643
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:05,989
points that are fall under the the

644
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,330
outline for what should and shouldn't be

645
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:11,240
on the mailing list and those include

646
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:14,030
discussion of focus on internet

647
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,250

651
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:29,360
platform please don't have social and

652
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:32,780
political arguments here and please be

653
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:39,080
yourself so here's some more of that

654
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:42,100
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiny print so can anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

655
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,100
bathroom<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see that</font>

656
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:49,620
okay so what here's a typical scenario

657
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:55,820
is that a subscriber might send email

658
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,820
the list and an mlc member volunteer or

659
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:00,450
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the community might bring it</font>

660
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,610
to our attention that this appears to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

661
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:06,090
a violation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AUP has</font>

662
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,860
posted on the website steering

663
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,760
committees authorized to make changes to

664
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:15,270
that AUP / nanonics charter by the way

665
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:20,700
so we've come to either a consensus or

666
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:22,559
one person opinion that that it's a

667
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,750
violation of the AUP some stuff is

668
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,700
pretty obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know they I don't</font>

669
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,830
really believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody's last name</font>

670
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,090
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> wellfleet if they post a list so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

671
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:34,260
know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them hey can you please</font>

672
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:36,120
leave your real name so way we usually

673
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to handle is to just ask people</font>

674
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,100
nicely you know don't yell at<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

675
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,280
because they're probably not aware that

676
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,668
they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong ask them</font>

677
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:53,070
nicely point out the AUP asked them to

678
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:54,480
honor it if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't stop the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MLC</font>

679
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll get together and try to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

680
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,080
consensus and send an official warning

681
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:04,739
to the user now<font color="#CCCCCC"> randy has expressed</font>

682
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,908
concern in the past that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

683
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,440
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between being contacted</font>

684
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:14,490
cordially and asked to modify one's

685
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,520
behavior and being actually warned is

686
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:22,350
not necessarily clear to the people who

687
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:25,500
are who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being warned but I would say</font>

688
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:27,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably just because Randy</font>

689
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,299
hasn't actually been warned about

690
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:34,980
anything yet we do try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it clear</font>

691
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:38,900
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know hey were no that</font>

692
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,900
was before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't us</font>

693
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:49,740
and that came with no warning so if

694
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,710
things don't don't cool down you know we

695
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked people nicely a few times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

696
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:58,140
warned them officially might end up

697
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,230
bouncing someone off the list for<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

698
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to six months we haven't had to do that</font>

699
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,040
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the most recent probably</font>

700
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,699
three or four cycles of me coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

701
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and giving this talk we could also</font>

anybody who's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that situation right</font>

705
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:25,050
now it and here's some mail that some

706
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,230
some text is both small and light so

707
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:30,750
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be even tougher to read</font>

708
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:33,150
but it's from me and it's to somebody

709
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:36,840
named Joe fubar at gmail com which is

lately um since the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting ah</font>

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,940
there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been no warnings no list</font>

00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,419
got really verbose but for some for some

727
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,270
strange reason they actually seem to

728
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,560
stay on topic more or less and nobody

729
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:28,129
was complaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them being</font>

730
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,030
off-topic which tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate our</font>

731
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:34,710
perception that they were staying on

732
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:36,420
topic so what hasn't been happening well

733
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,370
we had a new policy proposal that we

734
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:43,500
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the last meeting there</font>

735
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:45,510
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vacation message band there's</font>

736
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,910
documentation of existing policy which

737
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:50,580
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> removal process there was also an</font>

738
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:53,039
emergency action policy

739
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,990
and due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to time constraints and the fact</font>

740
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,179
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> did not delegate those out to somebody</font>

741
00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:00,390
who has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to get them into a more</font>

742
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:03,990
presentable form they have not moved

743
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:07,339
forward what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to do in</font>

744
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:10,260
the next few weeks is get them a

745
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:14,639
delegated to somebody who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose job is</font>

747
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:22,980

00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:25,199
that they're actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the wiki to the</font>

749
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,000
futures community and see if we can get

750
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,509
some discussion going there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe</font>

751
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,690
arrive at some consensus so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

752
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:35,970
technical stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this run-in with</font>

753
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,250
a company called<font color="#E5E5E5"> blogger which is now a</font>

754
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:40,109
Google property which means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

755
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,060
unfortunately affected by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> google</font>

756
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:43,918
code of silence and they'll fix stuff

757
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,480
but be darned if they're gonna let you

758
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,888
know what they actually fixed her that

759
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,030
they fixed it or anything like that so

760
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:52,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody was sending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down on mailing</font>

00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">lists mail they were subscribed to it</font>

762
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:57,450
they were forwarding it into blogger to

763
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:00,240
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> bloggers chew on it and presented</font>

764
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:03,149
in the form that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> liked and some</font>

765
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,259
posts to the list by no means all a very

766
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,849
small minority but it was repeatable and

767
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,270
had to do with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> being my I'm</font>

768
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:14,160
encapsulated in a particular way it was

769
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:18,599
generating a bounce back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font>

770
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,149
poster with no information like envelope

00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,849
to or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that no headers in</font>

772
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:28,470
the balance just hey I'm blogger I'm not

773
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:30,810
happy I didn't like your<font color="#CCCCCC"> message by so</font>

774
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,399
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was it was literally that brief</font>

775
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:35,730
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was no way that we could be</font>

776
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,740
expected to debug it based on that so we

777
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,740
came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this this cunning scheme</font>

778
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,140
and we decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were going to</font>

779
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a two-pronged approach to this talk</font>

780
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,819
to Warren and I talked some other people

781
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,580
who tried to chase this issue inside of

782
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:54,690
Google but the cone of silence actually

783
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,400
covers parts inside Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so they</font>

784
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,490
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily hear back when</font>

785
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,970
things are fixed properly but the

786
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,859
problem

787
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,109
seems to have solved itself will deal

788
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:07,529
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide we also</font>

789
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:12,549
decided simultaneously that we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

790
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:15,849
move the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana org mailing list stuff</font>

791
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:17,560
onto dedicated servers it currently

792
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:21,430
lives on something called trapdoor

793
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,779
mariju which is a list server a<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is dedicated to mailing list</font>

795
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,099
service on merits behalf and we decided

796
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so that we could have the latitude</font>

797
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:32,520
to run the list processing software that

798
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:35,140
we wanted perhaps a different MTA

799
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,290
operating system issues other stuff like

800
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,290
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prudent thing to do that</font>

801
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:45,790
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking especially of having a</font>

802
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:47,619
per recipient<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah envelope from in mail</font>

803
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:52,359
so that balances could come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

804
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:53,859
way that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be trackable we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

805
00:36:52,359 --> 00:37:00,250
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be nice to have this</font>

806
00:36:53,859 --> 00:37:02,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">on on a on a machine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of its own so what</font>

807
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:05,080
finally happened on the Google end we

808
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:08,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know it seems to be fixed though</font>

809
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,810
we have not had any complaints lately

810
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,940
how about that separate email server

811
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:15,369
well we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to merit staff before the</font>

812
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:18,310
holidays and didn't hear anything back

813
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:19,990
figured well it's the holidays<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in</font>

814
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,960
mid-january there was a comment made

815
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:24,580
about server donation having been

816
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,520
offered and accepted and that merit

817
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:30,490
staff would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be installing it shortly and</font>

818
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,250
gosh that came as a surprise to us so

819
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:35,859
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation was brought up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

820
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:38,050
recent SC call which unfortunately I

821
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:39,490
couldn't attend due to a scheduling

822
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,530
conflict it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more of a</font>

823
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:44,470
communication program problem than an

824
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,180
implementation problem and my

825
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">understanding is that all of us are</font>

829
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">a separate issue in a much much wider</font>

it and the SC decides to take it so the

and fax to somebody and at which point

841
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,220
it was photocopied then scan back in and

00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,750
when you when you mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it sort</font>

869
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,460
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that up on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wiki and</font>

rather than what it actually says then

00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,010
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole vacation policy now</font>

875
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:24,590
we had a go around on that where it

876
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:27,320
didn't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be wide enough and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,900
were several people who were vocally in

880
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,750
favor of it there was not unanimous

881
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:45,020
support for that because some people

882
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:48,500
have to send mail through outlook or

883
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:50,570
whatever and don't have the option of

886
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,060
there wasn't clear consensus on this we

need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get clear consensus before we</font>

talk about Nia noggin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its constant</font>

908
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,860

collaborative effort a community effort

910
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,680
and it couldn't nanog and the activity

911
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:56,779
could not happen without the partnership

913
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:03,290
that happens through the participation

of the SE the pc and the list admins

915
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:09,170
merit certainly has some representation

916
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:11,919
in all of those communities but we're in

917
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,660
this evolution as we've talked about

Don Walsh about is the idea of taking

991
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,720
the experience from hosting these

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,450

1003
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:57,970
real grim<font color="#E5E5E5"> well our contributors didn't</font>

1004
00:46:56,289 --> 00:47:00,730
put a bunch of logos up here I won't

1005
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:03,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">read all of the elements you can see</font>

1006
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:04,329
them on the website but you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1007
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,730
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of folks that really</font>

1008
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:10,589
aren't hosts but their contributors

1009
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:14,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're either donating hardware</font>

1010
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:16,180
donating time donating an effort to make

1011
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:20,140
this meeting happen and it's all about

1012
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:21,460
partnership our break sponsors these

1013
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:24,190
folks are important because they're

1014
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:27,490
actually contributing real dollars and

1015
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:29,890
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1016
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:32,859
we recognize them but that we appreciate

1017
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:34,990
their financial contribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> beer and</font>

1018
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gator sponsors we step up the the</font>

1019
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:39,549
contribution level a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

1020
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:42,579
again it's really important in the

1021
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:45,609
dynamics and the mix that we find ways

1022
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:48,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it is a return on investment for</font>

1023
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:50,890
all of these sponsors to be here to make

1024
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,720
these meetings happen so while we don't

1025
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,940
see this meeting as a marketing

1026
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,269
opportunity for them it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1027
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:00,849
important that as vendors hosting and

1028
00:47:58,269 --> 00:48:02,919
sponsoring these meetings they see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1029
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">a return on investment if we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1030
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,670
keep those registration dollars in check

1031
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,970
and you'll see why that counts in just a

1032
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:13,000
second thought I would I'll run through

1033
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,439
these really briefly at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end feel</font>

1034
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,670
free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me some questions because</font>

1035
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,309
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit late</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

1036
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:21,839
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of you want to get out of here</font>

1037
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:24,190
as we talked earlier there's a

1038
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,440
reorganization that's now complete and

1039
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:29,289
there's also a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> website at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt</font>

1040
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone learn a little</font>

1041
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:33,320
bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about merit</font>

1042
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:37,580
and see the product line that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to</font>

1043
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:39,740
offer direct support for Nana itself we

1044
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some new switchgear one of our</font>

1045
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:46,160
hardware vendors has donated some

1046
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:48,290
switchgear to nanog to merit to support

1047
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,339
these meetings<font color="#CCCCCC"> badly-needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

1048
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:55,610
appreciated that same vendor is donating

1049
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:58,910
a router to us that's really important

1050
00:48:55,610 --> 00:49:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">because sometimes we find a host that's</font>

1051
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:03,410
not a gear provider and we need to

1052
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide our own router and it's nice</font>

1053
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:09,980
than our stack of hardware if we have a

1054
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:12,380
brand new router to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use so</font>

1055
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:15,140
that was really important in greatly

1056
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:18,830
appreciated as Rob indicated there's

1057
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:21,650
some some dialogue that's been taking

1058
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:24,080
place since februari or excuse me since

1059
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">November and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will continue on a little</font>

1060
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit in February in terms of the</font>

1061
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:31,069
specifications of a new server the idea

1062
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:33,410
was early on that a member<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1063
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:36,200
community steps forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said hey</font>

1064
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:39,259
guys I can buy the littlest admin team a

1065
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,509
server no problem it's a donation and

1066
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,790
then we took it a little bit for further

1067
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:46,580
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeez instead of just</font>

1068
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:48,650
running a mail list application on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1069
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:51,650
server could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get some other things</font>

1070
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:53,210
out of the gift<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need to have some</font>

1071
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,280
dialogue which will be doing here

1072
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:59,300
shortly and there's still a commitment

1073
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,520
to donate hardware to that cause and Joe

1074

provo from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> steering committee is</font>

1075
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,620

1076
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:09,319
and certainly with Joe ably as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1077
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:13,390
about the wiki and the nanog website how

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we create this exchange between the</font>

00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:22,279
of the wiki and the merit managed nanog

1081
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:24,920
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so it's another one of those</font>

1082
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,040
evolution evolution issues we have the

1083
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:30,170
nano website that we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

1084
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,690
does certain things and we all know that

1085
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:35,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a wiki and we have a community</font>

forum that's growing and evolving and

1087
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:41,240
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that something new and so</font>

1088
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,730
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking forward to those sort of</font>

1089
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,129
discuss

1090
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,780
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably in June we'll have</font>

1091
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:49,619
something more to report and I suspect

1092
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:51,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Joe and Joe will be having lots of</font>

1093
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:53,609
discussions with all of you in nano

1094
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,940
futures and other forums about that and

1095
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:59,340
I as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and probably our merit</font>

1096
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,470
webmaster back at home saying well this

1097
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:04,369
was possible but that's not possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1098
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,629
it's just all<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of the dialogue</font>

1099
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:08,430
having said all of that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

1100
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important to stress the</font>

1101
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:13,770
importance of the survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> form we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

1102
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:16,169
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you'll hear about it throughout</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only way in</font>

1104
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:23,850
which merit can really validate and the

1105
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:26,310
nanog CSC excuse me and pc can validate

1106
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:28,368
what you think you know it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">forum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to tell us all</font>

1108
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:33,930
collectively all was the venue good did

1109
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:38,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it in Toronto was the program</font>

1110
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:42,660
great bad and and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear from you</font>

1111
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:45,750
so it was surprising to me when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

1112
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:50,250
the survey analysis from st. Louis that

1113
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:55,109
we got like 63 or 67 responses I have an

1114
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:56,640
attendee population oval over 400 it was

1115
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:57,990
also surprising to me I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1116
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,180
lecture you guys a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit so you</font>

1117
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:02,450
bear with me it was also surprising to

1118
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:06,149
me that when we did elections in October

1119
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:09,210
that there were over 2,000 people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1120
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:11,130
community eligible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote meaning you</font>

1121
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,630
could speak your mind about who should

1122
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:15,300
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the server on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steering</font>

1123
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:19,440
committee in just a little over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200</font>

1124
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">voted so merit in the end of my lecture</font>

1125
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,180
and we'll go ahead Merritt has invested

1126
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:27,210
a lot in all of you to give you the

1127
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:29,399

00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:36,060
exercise it not just count on the

00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:39,690
program committee by themselves to do

1132

the job end of lecture sorry and on to

<font color="#CCCCCC">the last page which is something that</font>

1134
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:46,680
we're all concerned about giving the

1135
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,109
transparency is the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where do we</font>

1136
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,970
stand on the budget you'll see these

00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:52,680
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our previous meeting being</font>

00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,259
released on the website and these will

be posted probably too

numbers the first number i wanted to

1146
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:13,669
share with you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see the</font>

two hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and twelve thousand dollars</font>

1148
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:18,260

00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:22,100
bank that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit has in the bank</font>

1150
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:24,560
to put reservations in for future

1151
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:29,330
contracts we need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to have a</font>

1157
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:43,460
what we do is we break out the expenses

1158
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:46,430
at a quarterly basis the fixed cost and

1159
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:49,870
the cost for the meeting and we try to

1160
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:52,339
to show you those numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this format</font>

1161
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:54,230
the revenue is the revenue it's a

1162
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,600
combination of what we get from sponsors

1163
00:53:54,230 --> 00:54:00,560
and registration fees and that's for the

1164
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:02,870
October meeting the expenses I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font>

to break them out into<font color="#E5E5E5"> categories the</font>

1182
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:55,610
very efficient in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the merit</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of staff that went to st. Louis so you</font>

1186
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:05,880
can see in your own travel expense

1187
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:09,480
budget how those numbers compare

1188
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,790
we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any excuse me non merit</font>

1190

00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:20,250
the hotel in<font color="#CCCCCC"> state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Louis to host the</font>

item GNA and systems overhead and that's

1194
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:29,549
the cost that every project at Merritt

1195
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:31,590
has to reimburse to the central

1196
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:34,320
administration the cost of our rent the

1197
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:37,020
cost of our insurance all of those kinds

1198
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:39,840
of fixed costs that every organization

1199
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:43,940
clearly nonprofits have so that's merits

1200
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:47,820
fixed costs and then you take the

1201
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">revenue all of the expenses and you get</font>

1202
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:53,370
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a per meeting balance so the</font>

1203
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:56,040
challenge for all of us this number is

1204
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:58,830
much better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was in our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last two</font>

1205
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,800
meetings and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect that Toronto will</font>

1206
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:04,470
be truly a great meeting and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

1207
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,680
see these red numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward but</font>

1208
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> balance of making sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1209
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,819
this is a class recovery cost recovery

1210
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:21,720
endeavor for all of us including there

1211
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:25,940
so there we go any questions we're 15

1212
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,939
minutes over Joe but thanks

1213
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:41,849
hello this is so long yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um there</font>

1214
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,470
really isn't anything else scheduled

1215
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:44,580
with slides to talk about or anything

1216
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,169
like that but that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1217
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,180
everyone's very quiet so I'm guessing

1218
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,220
this is going to be a big silent pause

1219
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:53,040
after I finish but if anybody has

1220
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:55,799
thoughts or comments about how nanog is

1221
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,660
hosted or the registration process or

1222
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,660
getting an account so that you can

1223
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:03,990
register or available t-shirt sizes or

1224
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:05,580
anything feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> very free to walk up to</font>

1225
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:08,549
the microphone if you don't want to walk

1226
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:10,080
up to the microphone right now then one

1227
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing we perhaps didn't emphasize enough</font>

1228
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,130
was we have a mailing list called nanog

1229
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,840
futures which has a relatively small

1230
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:19,020
memberships only compared to the main

1231
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,430
list but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would imagine that if you</font>

1232
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,930
care enough about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog works to</font>

1233
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,118
show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the community meeting then it</font>

1234
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:25,049
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good place to subscribe</font>

1235
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,849
anything that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally be off</font>

1236
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:28,830
topic for the main list because it's

1237
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:31,530
about non technical issues to do with

1238
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:34,650
how nanog works is most definitely on

1239
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:37,140
topic for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano futures list Mike um</font>

1240
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:38,730
yeah I'm running a bit slow today this

1241
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:41,580
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making lists up minute just</font>

1242
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:43,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">catching up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um actually one of the</font>

1243
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that Rob was saying about you</font>

1244
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">know not needing that much in terms of</font>

1245
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,080
heavy moderation or anything i wonder if

1246
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually proof that the approach</font>

1247
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:54,089
that they're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> is working rather</font>

1248
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:55,800
than and something being wrong or people

1249
00:57:54,089 --> 00:57:58,230
not being as crazy as they used to be or

1250
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,089
something you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

1251
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,480
good a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing rather than a bad</font>

1252
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:04,740
thing that um no news is good news

1253
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,970
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an observation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think and I</font>

1254
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,319

1256
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:13,680
putting in and the approach that they've

1257
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,299
taken when dealing with issues I think

1258
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,950
that's that may well be<font color="#CCCCCC"> true it's also</font>

1259
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,470
quite possible that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of a</font>

1260
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:20,910
fluke a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the times where we have</font>

1261
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,230
big problems on the list with threads

1262
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,910
running out of control is quite often

1263
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:25,980
only a very small number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people that</font>

1264
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:27,480
are responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for most of the noise so</font>

1265
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,680
all it really takes us to one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1266
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,240
suddenly get it be in their bonnet and

1267
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,500
suddenly the process is very important

1268
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,209

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more fully employed now the</font>

1271
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:46,919
economy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kicking back up</font>

observe that when things are running

1274
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:54,230
well you probably don't get a lot of

1275
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:56,880
feedback because well people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

1276
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:58,740
they sharpen their pitchforks in a real

1277
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,809
big hurry when they get unhappy though

1278
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,700
right so it's really obvious when you've

1300
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:02,098
last time i checked the SSID for the

1301
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:03,690
nanog and nanog networks was being

1302

advertised but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think probably that's</font>

1303
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,349
going to be stopped so if you do go up

1307
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:16,319
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just specify it manually and it</font>

1308
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:19,140
should just work magically and the idea

1309
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:21,000
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid confusing the other hotel</font>
