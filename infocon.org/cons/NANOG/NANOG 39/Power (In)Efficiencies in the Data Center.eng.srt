00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:08,099
ok so this the research here is or the

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,410
into it since I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes so in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of the distribution systems as you</font>

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,720
know and the data centers powers is ever

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,430
increasing the densities ups we've got

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,300
three main models that we see deployed

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,950
the double conversion AC to DC to feed

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,300
the batteries and then it's converted

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:46,079
back to AC you lose quite a bit about

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty percent depending on where the</font>

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,329
load goes in terms of the overall

00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,599
utilization of the UPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got the</font>

19
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,719
Delta conversion which is the majority

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power passes through and it's</font>

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,149
just filtered for to clean up the the

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,710
waves but the small portion is diverted

23
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,110
so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inefficiency</font>

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,399
sitting there and then you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,929
flywheel which doesn't have any

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,720
conversions because there's no batteries

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,780
it's just a flywheel so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these</font>

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,080
these different ups models and Lawrence

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,090
Berkeley did a research paper on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

30

32
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,740
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x x axis you see the the the</font>

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,199
active kind of power load across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ups</font>

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,689
and the efficiency on the on the y axis

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,400
so as you can see they all pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

36
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,339
pretty much share the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,750
efficiency as you get low into the total

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,070
you're loading your UPS effectively and

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,110
making sure there's enough power load

41
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,449
across there as it gets up that's where

42
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,189
you'll see the differences the various

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">lines for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the double conversion or the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta because there's one</font>

46
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,479

47
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,850
of that is that you get into bender lock

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:08,008
so turn into DC power again obviously

49
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,060
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's straight DC you remove the</font>

50
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,069
need for any multi

you know power conversion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

related inefficiencies that get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC</font>

53
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,079
if you've been around telco land forever

54
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,530
you know it's proven maintenance terms

of server farms and reliability record

56
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,550
is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> there still don't see it</font>

57
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:31,120
widespread across all data centers just

58
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,870
this kind of I'll say n8 fear of DC for

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,150
some particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason you do get the</font>

60
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,160
downside on the DC powers that you lose

61
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,720
some during the transmission do the

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:47,079
lower voltage<font color="#CCCCCC"> Meg 48 and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing in</font>

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,609
data centers really looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some</font>

64
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,910
interesting things in terms of high

65
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,130
voltage to negate that low voltage that

66
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the transmission loss there and</font>

67
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,319
basically pulling out the high voltage

68
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:03,150
anywhere from the 372 550 depending on

69
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors packages all the way out to</font>

to the to the distribution to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the racks</font>

71
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,119
the third made major component of

72
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,989
inefficiencies in the data centers that

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,299
we're seeing is is in the power supplies

74
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,489
for the equipment themselves and this is

75
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> based upon the multi-voltage</font>

76
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,709
regulations within within the power

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,560
supplies or within the component systems

78
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:35,230
you'll see anything from one to twelve

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,870
and so so by you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> by reducing or by</font>

80
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,700
eliminating if you were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to a</font>

81
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,120
standard kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of voltage across the</font>

82
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,069
entire system component<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd really be</font>

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,739
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take out the the inefficiency</font>

84
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,950
from that from that particular step in

85
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,109
the process it's just chart full of

86
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,828
numbers that shows the relationship in

87
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:58,810
terms of its a church phone numbers that

88
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,329
shows the relationship between power and

89
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,310
cooling because the inefficiency is that

90
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,650
that's expressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in heat that's released</font>

91
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,769
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look across here and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

92
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,690
see on the table on the right 70 watts

93
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,609
per square foot if you extrapolate that

94
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,560
out to a thousand square feet of data

95
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,780
center space you're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">need a 20-ton crack unit to hit that</font>

97
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,309
that you're in if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do any</font>

98
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,409
redundancy and plus 12 and you need to

99
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure that you know you</font>

100
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,700
plenty of that because you're hitting

101
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,320
those densities and in today's world

102
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,050
we're seeing five times that now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,000
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 350</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know watts per</font>

square foot across a thousand square

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,510
feet all the time but you'll see pockets

106
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:44,510
of that throughout the data center so

107
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:47,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to you got to address that issue</font>

108
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,289
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you do and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

109
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing because I can</font>

110
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,400
show you all the nice pretty charts and

111
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,659
pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything else but you</font>

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,700
need to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at from two</font>

113
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,840
different perspectives from a design

114
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,659
guidelines when you're looking at

115
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,159
building out data centers you need to

116
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,140
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the future obviously I think</font>

117
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,360
you've heard this but the power

118
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,909
densities there's no kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of end in</font>

sight in terms of short to mid-term kind

120
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,370
of path and so they're going to continue

technical industry specs so you'll see

143
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,020
them implemented a little differently

I'll put the perfect I'll in the cold

tin tin cabinets 10 racks etc you can

it's kind of like the cabling easy thing

is just sucking the hot air out again

172
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,150
that's the concern in terms of the

in terms of the rack cooling take a look

<font color="#E5E5E5">at some of the liquid cooling that's</font>

no questions excellent thanks very much
