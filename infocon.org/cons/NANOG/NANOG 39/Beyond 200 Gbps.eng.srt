all right hi I'm news<font color="#E5E5E5"> Parker I work for</font>

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,320
i'm a bit fluish so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hope you can</font>

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,109
understand me in the back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this mike moore in my position now</font>

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,340
i'll be talking about generic scaling

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,220
issues that we as am-6 as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> insight</font>

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,840
half decade or something if you have a

10
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,330
question you can save them up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">ends but feel free to to interrupt me</font>

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,769
and ask a question during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk so</font>

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,620
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the the basic traffic pattern</font>

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,829
statistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> tops will slide is from</font>

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,230
februari last year the bottom one I just

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,710
took and the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern hasn't</font>

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:54,750
changed much except the y axis has grown

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,989
from 160 to 240 gigabit it's worth

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,320
pointing out these floating x-axis isn't

20
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,820
it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero floats yeah the 0 isn't zero</font>

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,930
just so you can actually see that

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,040
there's a difference between day and

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,810
night this graph is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more</font>

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,560
interesting go the logarithmic scale on

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,900
the left on the y-axis it's normalized

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,580
traffic growth per month it means that

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic growth and you</font>

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,039
divided by number of days per month and

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,740
this is a linear fit to a logarithmic

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,600
scale so it's been exponential growth

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,990
for since 98 the efforts growth rate has

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,658
been seven percent per month we don't

34
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:43,530
coming more surface like that keynote

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,890
has been about that we've been managing

gige of the past 23 years in fact

40
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,079
there's one member who will be

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:15,620
no 100 gig in here yes then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

47
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,060

48
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,390
to putting it in there because she's

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to gaya growth is port growth is</font>

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,458
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig e ports growth is sort of</font>

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,769
slowing down<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 gige is really</font>

53
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:37,190
picking up we have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty</font>

54
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:42,230
plus members with 430<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus ports right</font>

55
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:45,410
now the job where we've set out to do is

56
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,510
to build the infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

57
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:52,010
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> interconnect and get rid of that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic send it to their peers in extra</font>

59
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,370
slides I'll go for the historic netword

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,750
layout stats m6 has used in past

<font color="#E5E5E5">half-decade we started in 1999</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with two</font>

63
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,950
very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> model but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has a few</font>

64
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,450
limitations the switches run out of

65
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:17,690
switchboard it's not really enough for

66
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,488
for proper redundancy between<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides you</font>

67
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,989
run out of data center space tues too

68
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,730
many people who want to connect on to

69
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:27,950
have to root around side and yeah it's

70
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,950
just it limits it's pretty limited

71
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,100
obviously I do think that torex is right

72
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:39,470
now at this stage and sort of comparable

73
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:41,840
anyway the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next step m6 made was</font>

74
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:46,670
expanding to two additional sites in

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,920
2000 with a ring structure and this ring

76
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,920
topology didn't really scale well the

77
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,589
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the moment you have a lot of</font>

78
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,268
traffic between two particular sites you

79
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,940
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade the whole ring in order</font>

80
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,180
to sustain outages so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were running</font>

81
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,519
spanning tree at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and edge sites</font>

82
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,620
three and a site for were quite busy the

83
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,200
name three four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> six for historic</font>

84
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,790
reasons so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,700
usually between three and four because

86
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,589
they were restoring

87
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,870
the early side and we had to upgrade

88
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,950
traffic we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great back on links in</font>

89
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:27,150
the whole ring in order to to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

90
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:29,550
be resilient against failures so also

91
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,370
spanning tree is a bit of a bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

92
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment any change happens then it</font>

93
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,860
starts flapping for a while it may not

94
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,500
stabilize you get members trying to

95
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,020
stalk spanning tree to you and one

96
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,540
switch that has a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of CPU it as high</font>

97
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,310
cpu load can affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole exchange</font>

98
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,650
because spending three starts flapping

99
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:55,350
and you have too many ports<font color="#CCCCCC"> in for lee</font>

connecting again members because that

fears of big speakers communicate and

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,800
decide which one is master which ones

127
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,860
back up and the backup put swords links

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,479
in blocking modes and

129
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,580
some past traffic that is seized from

130
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,378
there and the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> the master</font>

131
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,520
disappears or its priority goes down or

00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever then the other the backup takes</font>

133
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:40,870
over and puts always links in forwarding

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,979
for affected members and in retrospect

149
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,050
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> proven to be a very good</font>

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:29,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution because we've had our share of</font>

153
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:37,599
really want customers to to have

155
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,128
in the switch and with the photonics

156
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:46,539
which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect gonna we connect any</font>

157
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:49,360
ports to of tonic switch and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

158
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:51,818
topologies and depending on which course

159
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,900
which is active we connect them to the

160
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:57,460
left or the right course which and yeah

161
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,909
it means we have quite some duplication

162
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,349
in hardware but it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that you</font>

163
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:06,669
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on half the network without</font>

164
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:09,400
having to take down any any member ports

165
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:13,198
it is also greatly facilitated upgrades

166
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,638
in that we we've been able to map

167
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,250
customer connections to new and switches

168
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,740
that we installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> without breaking their</font>

169
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,449
link and moving their fibers we could

170
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,710
work on the non active part of the

171
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:28,779
network the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup part of the network</font>

172
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:30,159
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we switch over to to work on</font>

173
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,370
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the network to finish</font>

174
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,960
the migration

175
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,679
and we've done several migrations this

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,539
way for example the or the original

177
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,489
introduction of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking II at switches</font>

178
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:44,150
because we didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> them first</font>

179
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,010
connecting forced to the court and later

180
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,529
also to upgrade the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad switches we</font>

181
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,080
migrated from mgh to foundry eric 16

182
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:57,520
switches with hardly anybody noticing

183
00:08:51,080 --> 00:09:01,040
that so taking equal parts brief history

184
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,439
as you see there's quite some growth a

185
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,920
lot of members with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 gige aggregated</font>

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:12,380

188
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:22,279

upgrading switches so this this limit

208

won't be reached when we run into the

Mike actually Todd's first mr. Underwood

253
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:48,959
go I thought Todd unrooted Renesys so

254
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:52,980
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a brewing brouhaha of conflict</font>

255
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:57,060
around 40 gig vs 100 gig and people in

256
00:12:52,980 --> 00:13:00,360
your situation and and Mike situation

257
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,400
are pretty uniformly saying 40 gig is

258
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,590
useless to me it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough more than</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">my edge I have to have 100 gig and I</font>

a bunch of other people saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but</font>

262
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,940
40 gig is doable much much sooner and

263
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,100
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be better to focus on can</font>

264
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,320
you comment on where that is in the

265
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,630
standardization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whether 40 gig would</font>

266
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,600
be at all useful to you well we already

267
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,670
have 8-port 10 gige aggregated links so

268
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,490
we're already pushing 80 gigs between

269
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,530
different switches 40 gig would not help

270
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,940
us much except save us three fiber pairs

271
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we really need is Hannah Giggy</font>

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,130
leapfrogging all for the current

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,460
technology traffic is doubling every

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:43,890
year and going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two to 40 gig is</font>

00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:47,880
just the power station it's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

276
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:50,010
so just so saving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair's saving the</font>

277
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,460
pair's sooner saving those three pair

278
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,830
sooner not good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough it's just a gun</font>

279
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,530
make saving the three pair going to 40

280
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:01,800
gig and saving the three pair yeah by

281
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:04,829
the end of this year save vs. Wade I was

achieve the same thing using DWDM optics

284
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,270
they're becoming very affordable and

285
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:17,150
even in a metro area such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam</font>

where fiber is readily<font color="#CCCCCC"> available usually</font>

287
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:23,370
it is already becoming economically

344
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:58,889
would be until which traffic level you

345
00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:01,019
will allow 100 megabit ports because if

with this traffic level because of the

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:16,408
that it doesn't flood out port and also

371
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:19,169
that it doesn't choke the switches

372
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:24,210

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,450
cases where cisco routers have had their

376
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:36,210
sending traffic destined for one big

Pere to another peers MAC address which

378
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:44,220
would then have like a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic</font>

379
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:46,709
than it used to have I guess we'll

that actually as well about that the

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:22,020
mean in London<font color="#CCCCCC"> that links we've got</font>

393
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,340
quite a significant push from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the BBC</font>

394
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,370
because of their unique way that they're

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,459
funded by you by tax basically rather

396
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,620
than adverts they are quite heavily

397
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,770
involved in pushing out multicast IPTV

400

but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need to receive any</font>

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,410

404
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,110

gig port to connect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> multicast</font>

saying because we long opposed to have
