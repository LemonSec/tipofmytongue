00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,750
hi good morning and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> David night I</font>

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on the team that operate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fisc and</font>

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,540
so yesterday we saw the first attack

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,389
with a significant impact against root

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,799
nameservers for quite some time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,810
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the observations</font>

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,580
very preliminary observations we made

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,439
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday I guess a lot of people</font>

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,419
have probably seen this graph this is a

ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> ncc SDNS mon and this particular</font>

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,570
nameservers you see there each<font color="#E5E5E5"> row is</font>

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:41,820
representing one server and yeah the

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,640
scary of the color the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse the ability</font>

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,610
at that time of that server to answer

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,879
queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you see the attacks that are</font>

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,680
very abruptly at ten a.m. UTC and yeah

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,849
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some servers were affected worse</font>

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:04,559
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> others what we saw again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:07,140
abrupt begin to the attack our normal

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,280
traffic there is almost lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably around 10 megabit and we saw</font>

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">very quickly increased now in this graph</font>

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,820
it looks like it's increasing to 800 as

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,950
I discovered last night how we put this

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,508
graph together isn't quite correct this

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,330
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing what's actually arriving at</font>

29
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,420
our servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bulk of our servers</font>

30
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,280
have 100 megabit interfaces so what

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,200
we're counting here is where where these

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,670
have been maxed out a couple of nodes we

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,250
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> label account that that node</font>

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,770
received 200 megabits wit as as I move

35
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,509
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see that these two nodes in</font>

36
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,000
particulars were the bulk of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic</font>

37
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,729
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw arrived now our node in</font>

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">Seoul again the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server's there have</font>

39
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,539
hundred mega interfaces so when we look

40
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,189
at the traffic stats for that we would

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,689
see it looking like 200 but whereas if

42
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">we actually look at the writer interface</font>

43
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,059
we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> even the right on interface</font>

44
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,200
which was gigabit was maxed out also so

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,479
we have to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were actually</font>

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting more than gigabit at that</font>

47
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,649
particular node and the other node that

48
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,799
saw significant increase in traffic was

49
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,180
in Beijing it maxed out around three

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,150
hundred and then we believe that

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,120
networks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> China very quickly started</font>

52
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,980
filtering this so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure exactly</font>

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,700
just how much traffic we would have seen

54
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:31,380
there we did see traffic other nodes

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,329
also Hong Kong<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw and an increase but</font>

56
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,519
nothing nearly significant as this and

57
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">also in Amsterdam our new bridges</font>

58
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,840

increase in traffic now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's obviously</font>

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,040
quite distant to the three nodes which

61
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,560
have seen the bulk of this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,000
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> peered am-6 twice we have twice as</font>

63
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,340
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> peeling I am sex than we do</font>

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,870
anywhere else<font color="#CCCCCC"> so obviously a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

65
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,610
bigger networks are there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:03:00,450
carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic to Amsterdam back</font>

67
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:06,780
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS monograph again on the the first</font>

68
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:09,030
picture I showed so that a fruit was

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,040
continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to serve during the attack</font>

70
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:16,440
but we see that from certain vantage

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,299
points FF service was degraded but in

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,030
the main service to end users across the

73
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,730
internet was was alive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well but for</font>

74
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,820
particular point there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a certain</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregation of service but that's how</font>

76
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,670
our models supposed to work the idea

77
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,350
being that because we have these local

78
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,708
modes which are only visible to direct

79
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,350
peers if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort at traffic is</font>

80
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,989
originating in that area then only that

81
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,760
note should be should receive that

82
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,070
traffic and other nodes I with that

83
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,070
region shouldn't see it and so are<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Donata</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were seized almost nothing if</font>

85
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:56,910
nothing at all of the attack traffic and

86
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,510
we did see some odd shapes in the

87
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,310
traffic to other nodes further from from

88
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,489
the region where the bulk of this was

89
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,260
going on and we have to assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

90
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,380
networks have been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad-hoc</font>

91
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,320
filtering to protect themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

92
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,769
which happened within an hour or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so of</font>

93
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attack beginning if you remember the</font>

94
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,260
picture a couple of slides back this

95
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,200
very abruptly cuts off with as we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

96
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,370
much smoother of decay at those nodes

97
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,370
actually in region

98
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:35,008
what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is um this is just we have</font>

99
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:40,469
approximately I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> 36 nodes globally</font>

100
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:42,449
or 37 and during the attack more than

101
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,639
half of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic was arriving at one</font>

102
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,410
of them and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in Seoul the other</font>

103
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,680
one there the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next biggest one is</font>

104
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,479
Beijing and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yellowish one</font>

105
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,699
there is our global<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode that's the one</font>

106
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:57,020
node which is visible globally across

107
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,400
the internet and so we assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

108
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,289
picking up the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scatter which isn't</font>

109
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,799
being captured<font color="#E5E5E5"> by these these two nodes</font>

110
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:06,900
actually in the region and then the

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,360
seven percent there is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other</font>

112
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:15,270
nodes which is about 34 or 35 local

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,800
nodes which would which among all 35 of

114
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,570
those nodes and all the rest of the

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,060
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> was distributed and most of</font>

116
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,259
those didn't see any at all for example

117
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,660
in South America and we saw almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

118
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:30,990
attack traffic whatsoever now it's

119
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,120
important to stress that I'm talking

120
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the traffic coming from a specific</font>

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,690
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you this yet this is very</font>

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,940
preliminary based purely on we think

125
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,070
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can triangulate source of</font>

126
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,090
traffic because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the nodes are</font>

127
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,669
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a reasonable</font>

128
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,570
distribution of nodes and we should only

129
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:56,639
see traffic from direct peers but more

130
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">in-depth analysis actually looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

131
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:05,009
the traffic a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot deeper will go on in</font>

132
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:07,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">is esor and also looking more deeply</font>

133
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,630
into what the actual attack packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

134
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,009
like what looking at it very preliminary

135
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:15,150
we see that they're bigger than normal

136
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:17,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than 350</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes mostly</font>

partially formed<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS messages a mixture</font>

138
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:25,110
of updates and queries and some which

139
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:27,000
are just broken all together so really

140
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on this very preliminary look at</font>

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,479
what we saw operationally we think that

142
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,240
our anycast<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up did what it was</font>

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,539
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we believe that the traffic</font>

144
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,560
mostly originated in in the korea-china

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,080
area

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,590
and we managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to contain it in that</font>

147
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,080
area but yeah I keep stressing this was

148
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,909
a very preliminary look at things mostly

149
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,979
from just looking at graphs of will

150
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,080
traffic appeared and there'll be much

151
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,110
more in-depth analysis of this going on

152
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,729
based on we<font color="#E5E5E5"> captured the attack traffic</font>

153
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,230
at these nodes and we'll be looking

154
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:06,570
deeply into that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> IFC so art and that</font>

155
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">captured data will be available to work</font>

156
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,610
members and once the analysis is

157
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete there will be something</font>

158
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:19,710
published to the community at large<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

159
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:20,940
that's me is there any questions any

160
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:26,520
questions for day even there's three

161
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:28,710

<font color="#CCCCCC">same as what we saw for I we saw less</font>

164
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,400
total attack traffic the the burst above

165
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,200
normal only came to about 60 megabytes

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,799
globally<font color="#CCCCCC"> is up but about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

169
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:53,340
impacted as as big as some other service

170
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,770
most of the traffic was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so into a</font>
