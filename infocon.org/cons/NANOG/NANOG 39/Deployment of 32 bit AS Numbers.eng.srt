1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,930
okay thank you so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">about deploying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bjs numbers and</font>

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,149
the work we did at the ripe NCC so this

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,219
is the overview of my talk I'll give a

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,340
couple of background slides don't skip

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,509
most of them as Jeff covered them and

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,859
then I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the deployment work</font>

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,150
implementation work we did a drive in CC

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,070
and end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some lessons to be</font>

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,769
learned ok this is what motivates at all

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,100
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of a s numbers this is</font>

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,280
a plot I made a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:43,230
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of aes numbers over time</font>

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:47,460
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the 65 well 16 bits so 64k</font>

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:54,239
numbers goes up knives nice and smoothly

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:57,629
as of late 2006 we at the 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 38</font>

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,629
thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those 6405 64k numbers</font>

18
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:04,470
instead files there was some 6,000 ER

19
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,689
articles and some 20,000 left and he can

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,460
do some maps well the looking for

21
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,039
consumption rates and have a couple of

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,570
references here the navel and myself

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,290
presented it in an affair 35 Jeff also

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,880
presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana 35 bottom line is the</font>

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,119
application rate of<font color="#CCCCCC"> aa's members is</font>

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,610
about 10 to 12 a day and if you do a

27
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,320
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of math you see slightly</font>

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,780
depending on the model that will run out

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to various numbers sometime between late</font>

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,170
2010 and already 2013 so for the purpose

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,889
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk I'm going to be pessimistic</font>

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:46,500
and assume 2010 so what do we do in 2010

33
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,689
we need more is numbers well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,240
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can obviously do is try to</font>

35
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,579
recover all the unused aes members if

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the statistics you see that</font>

37
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,389
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any ass number use it for a</font>

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,399
couple of years then<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop using it so</font>

39
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,909
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots and lots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I used a as</font>

40
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,369
numbers out there unfortunately nobody

41
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,649
really knows where they've gone and who

42
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,780
is responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this so recovering</font>

43
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:15,440
may seem an option in practice it's

44
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,880
well it will be very hard the other

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,200
thing is it will only postpone the

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,510
problem for a couple of years it won't

47
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,519
solve it and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we recover all the</font>

48
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,899
ASM as well we can live for another two

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,569
or three years and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then and then what's</font>

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:32,810
so the other solution is at a few more

51
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:35,480
bites to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heirs number so that's why</font>

52
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,390
the 32 bit aes number<font color="#CCCCCC"> are is and 32</font>

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,790
proposal came up that extends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

54
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,040
space from 64k to something like four

55
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:47,480
billion and with four billion we can

56
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:52,010
live a million years<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there's a</font>

57
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">proposal Jeff already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show to draft it's</font>

58
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,319
essentially an IDF proposed to the

59
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:02,269
extent years and space to 32 bits with

60
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:05,089
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> NASPA nice features main thing</font>

61
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,769
is it cannot it we don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flag</font>

62
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,010
date and we can operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mix world</font>

63
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:14,510
forever so I'll skip<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition</font>

64
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:16,910
mechanism Jeff cover deaths so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

65
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:20,179
where the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the draft is now</font>

66
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,920
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes GQ</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the last time I</font>

67
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,320
checked I was still one or two details

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,220
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fixed I believe that's soft and</font>

69
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:33,798
the ref 13 of the draft and essentially

70
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:38,420
we're ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deploy this so deploying</font>

71
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:41,090
is 30 tues well what do you need well

72
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,458
first thing is yet the draft only says

73
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,940
this is how it works we don't have

74
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:49,760
policy for handing them out then at IRS

75
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,340
well we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a policy larc to</font>

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,920
start requesting them rars have to be

77
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,750
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle those requests and then</font>

78
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,018
you folk have to have to start using

79
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">them that means upgrading hardware tools</font>

80
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:06,200
test these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and put it into a</font>

81
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,540
routine operations so a policy for

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,030
handing out<font color="#E5E5E5"> asn 30 tubes this is a</font>

83
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,890
policy proposal made in the region<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

84
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,920
similar proposals were<font color="#CCCCCC"> made in for other</font>

85
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:20,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">regions and it isn't essentially for</font>

86
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,729
step or three steps the first step is

87
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:25,159
now starting January first of this year

88
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:29,510
until the end of next year

89
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,570
during this period folks asking for a

90
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,840
phone is number can ask for eternia's

91
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,240
and 16<font color="#CCCCCC"> rnas and 32 the default will be</font>

92
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,090
that you get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stew bite or 16 bits</font>

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,720
one but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really ask for you can</font>

94
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:50,239
ask get a 32-bit one it will flip on

95
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">january first 2009 when you can still</font>

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask for boats but hopefully everybody is</font>

97
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,650
ready older routers and all the code

98
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,440
supports it so the default will be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32</font>

99
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit aes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number only if you specifically</font>

100
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,790
asked for it you can still get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 61</font>

101
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:09,620
well then we'll continue for another

102
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:14,810
year by that time run ads and after 2010

103
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,550
you always get a 32-bit number I don't

104
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,340
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's important to notice this is</font>

105
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only change in the ass allocation</font>

106
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:27,049
policies all the other things remain the

107
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:29,300
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like I said this proposal was</font>

108
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,190
made in the ripe region for similar

109
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,850
proposals were made in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> four other</font>

110
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,490
agents consensus was reached everywhere

111
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:40,730
as of late last year and it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

112
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:45,200
policy in all five regions since January

113
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:48,410
first of this year when these policies

114
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,479
were submitted ser one of the our eyes

115
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,270
we start to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to</font>

116
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,360
start handling requests for a is and 32

117
00:05:53,270 --> 00:06:00,109
as of<font color="#CCCCCC"> January</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the other</font>

118
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,450
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we we also have you as an</font>

119
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,150
ally<font color="#E5E5E5"> are have to have to be ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

120
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AS numbers as of january first</font>

121
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:11,000
2009 so we started looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

122
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,150
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me well i have an AS so why</font>

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,919
should I care well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't</font>

124
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,010
on the other hand lots of you folks

125
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,909
build sites for for customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and give</font>

126
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:25,490
them equal equal equipment address space

127
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever and yeah there you have to</font>

128
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">be ready for for handling asn 32 since</font>

129
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:36,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">your new customers will will use them so</font>

130
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:39,940
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rars unaffected</font>

131
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:43,480
okay the policy is now in place you can

132
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">request an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asn 32 and if you do this</font>

133

interruption<font color="#E5E5E5"> CC there's this thing</font>

134
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,880
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nia's number request form looks</font>

135
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,560
like this some general information and

136
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,719
there's a field supplemental comments

137
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,140
and the only thing that changed there

138
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,290
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asn 32 you simply</font>

139
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,770

143
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:22,080
details vary but essentially it's the

144
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:25,630
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just ask for it then</font>

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,740
attract and CC we saw this coming and we

146
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,750
started to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this and well first</font>

147
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,700
thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice well our registration</font>

148
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,690
systems were designed for 16 bits

149
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,820
numbers that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> forms tools databases we</font>

150
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,010
have this thing the kultea our portal

151
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:46,360
which allows people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manage their</font>

152
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:48,370
resources online on to a web form lots

153
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">more all this was designed for 16 bits</font>

154
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,830
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we looked a bit further and we</font>

155
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,230
found out that yeah we use a is numbers

156
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of other places like</font>

157
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,270
our peering script our routers we have a

158
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,030
device called tuberous which collect

159
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,880
routing information we have a thing

160
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:11,640
called the router arriving registry

161
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:14,290
consistency check which compares routing

162
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,650
registry information with what seen on

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net that's all in 16-bit a SS we</font>

165
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,820
use 16 bits and probably more so we have

166
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:30,280
work to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do so we started looking at</font>

167
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,030
implementing this and the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

168
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:37,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">was was about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a year ago when we went</font>

169
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,400
through all our systems documents

170
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,890
procedures and we look for all the

171
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,550
places where the word is popped up and

172
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,750
we defined what had to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> upgraded and</font>

173
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,790
we were to click on quite a bit since we

174
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,280
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> work item 47 departments in the</font>

175
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:55,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">NCC and about something like one and a</font>

176
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,589
half to two many years of work well<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

177
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">we set up a team to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the work this</font>

178
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">team started in August and had to go off</font>

179
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,240
to be to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us early to</font>

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven and we'll see in a second if we</font>

181
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,450
succeeded so here's the team I'm not

182
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,310
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read all the names it just</font>

183
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,920
showed you in both is probably more

184
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:18,560
interesting other departments see it's

185
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,020
pretty much digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> company software and</font>

186
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,290
registration<font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious we have</font>

187
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,170
training materials they use a SS all

188
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,449
over the place finance we build people

189
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,069
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resources they hold so hey</font>

190
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,050
if you have something new Colton a

191
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,930
32-bit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s number that has to be</font>

192
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">adjusted well and if you are the</font>

193
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">department's that's a lot of lot of</font>

194
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">people lots of departments involved so</font>

195
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,670
this team started in<font color="#E5E5E5"> August and the</font>

196
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,700
first problem with it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notation</font>

197
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,770
and surprisingly this is not specified

198
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the in the draft how you how you</font>

199
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:59,240
actually write those numbers so people

200
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">used a column one column</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be well for it</font>

201
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,160
for this number so the before the column

202
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,860
is higher 16 bits well the problem is

203
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it works with very easy to confuse</font>

204
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:13,310
this with community strings so we needed

205
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,130
something else so there's a another

206
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:20,180
proposal that's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michaelson draft</font>

207
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:24,200
which essentially uses this dot so ASX

208
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:31,280
for the 16 bit numbers and a s0y for

209
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:34,360
32-bit numbers advantage of this it's

210
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,100
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all other bgp attributes</font>

211
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,420
it also has been informally accepted by

212
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,490
one vendor and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rsf accepted this as</font>

213
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open question in the draft is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 dot</font>

214
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,339
323 of elephant ation or should you drop

215
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:54,740
the leading<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero current answer is yes</font>

216
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:57,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and well this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> since this is ITF work</font>

217
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,399
it's it's a workout put into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mayor</font>

218
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,510
working group unfortunately well there

219
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,670
were some comments in the mailing list

220
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there is no consensus and this whole</font>

221
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:10,430
draft has been put on hold well so for

222
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,120
the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> being we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assumed that this</font>

223
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,189
format is it will be used but it's still

224
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,950
it's still an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open question and it may</font>

225
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:23,649
affect our work and we may have to redo

226
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:26,480
things later well we accepted that then

227
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,160
next thing we hit was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we now have</font>

228
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know how to write these numbers we</font>

229
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,500
have our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl our peers l routing policy</font>

230
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,529
specification language was written with

231
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:42,380
a and 16 in mind never thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about for</font>

232
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:45,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TSS and so we had to extend it now</font>

233
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:49,790
our peers<font color="#E5E5E5"> l has its extension mechanism</font>

234
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:51,709
and our first thought was to use this on

235
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,769
the second thoughts this didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

236
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:58,969
like a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea problem is you can it</font>

237
00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:01,970
reintroduces extensions and you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

238
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,550
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32 new attributes and basically you</font>

239
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,839
would end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an ace and 30 crew</font>

240
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,719
equivalent of everything that's already

241
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,339
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that would be fairly</font>

242
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,170
impractical in your code since you would

243
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,360
have to check for all the attributes of

244
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,880
first for the 60 mid one then check if

245
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,769
there's a 32-bit one then convert and

246
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">now I would do exactly the same so</font>

247
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:25,959
that's highly impractical so we wrote a

248
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,550
draft to change you can change language

249
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:33,079
using essentially the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> notations to</font>

250
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:36,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Michaelson draft the thing we added</font>

251
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,479
there just for for convenience busted on

252
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:43,370
outputs leading<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be dropped and</font>

253
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,199
an input it may be accepted this is a

254
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,990
bit bored it means a bit of work since

255
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:50,180
people will have to upgrade the tools on

256
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:55,279
the other hand you only have one

257
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:58,670
attribute for everything whether it's 16

bit aes or 32-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asus it's a one one</font>

259
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,229
time exercise there's a list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

260
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,209
a list of affected attributes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

261
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,660

your your coat and check this draft is

263
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,780

265
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:22,670
that's the that's place where it's being

266
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:25,010
discussed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so then we start with we</font>

267
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,500
know the notation we started look at the

268
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,120
software well obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't going to</font>

269
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">bother you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with with the code since it's</font>

270
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,940
all very<font color="#CCCCCC"> ncc specific but the things you</font>

271
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,010
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at also if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have your</font>

272

275
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,770
the main danger there is that some

276
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,600
languages pearl for example will they

277
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,870
meet exiled white as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> floating point</font>

you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in see ya it will break since</font>

live happily forever the other thing

283

upgrade our routers

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">scripts lying around that did things</font>

374
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,918
with a s numbers like statistics

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">belaying consistently check all those</font>

376
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,690
things we will have to go to the

377
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,090
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade them and this is</font>

378
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,309
something well obviously you won't have

379
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,959
these scripts in your in your

380
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,789
environment but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something you will</font>

381
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:51,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do make sure that this is</font>

382
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:53,140
handled correctly so we did some

383
00:18:51,220 --> 00:19:00,429
planning like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said we had to be ready</font>

384
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:03,700
early early 2007 and yeah well did we

385
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:06,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">succeed and the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that one is</font>

386
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,909
yes we we set this we will be able to

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,809
we started well we don't work on new

391
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,559
year's day we will start working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

393
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,899
allocates we allocated as3 point 0 on

394
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,809
january seconds and just to prove this

395

400
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,399
this one on the nets we do see other

401
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:55,580
ones like the one jeff mentioned in his

402
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:59,149

415
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:42,978
are people asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a 32-bit a SS yes</font>

416
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:46,070
they are I checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the statistics</font>

Aaron so status well we solve a little

421
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:05,869
bit of work to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done but essentially</font>

422
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:07,399
we have completed this and just to

423
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:11,478
finish off with a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of lessons to</font>

424
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:15,199
be learned well been working on this for

425
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:17,479
about half a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and upgrading to a</font>

426
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,349
zen 32 this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely not rocket</font>

427
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:23,419
science it's relatively straightforward

428
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:28,029
on the other hand it's it's a lot of

429
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:31,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">work a sense have been 16 bits forever</font>

430
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:33,080
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look back at the project</font>

431
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:35,210
reports I see that we indeed spend

432
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,249
something like one half to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million</font>

433
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:41,840
years of work divided over the whole

434
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:44,720
company of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're registry so we</font>

435
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,408
do a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that most people</font>

436
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,559
don't do with with a SS but we do

437
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:54,220
operate a medium sizes and that

438
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:57,639
work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took out all the work that's</font>

439
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:01,749
reached<font color="#CCCCCC"> really to registration of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> esas</font>

440
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:04,330
and just look at our network when I do

441
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:06,009
that we end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something like a</font>

442
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,620
half to<font color="#CCCCCC"> three quarters of main year of</font>

443
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:10,210
work which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a significant amount</font>

444
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,248
of work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you operate a</font>

445
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">medium-sized network it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

446
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:18,279
something usually should be planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

447
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,049
so that's I think the main lesson you

448
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:23,559
should start about thinking start

449
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:26,950
thinking about this now has fenders for

450
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,110
support if not if the vendors won't

451
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,320
support it you'll you'll be improve an

452
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:35,019
SD surprise in 209 when you get a 32 bit

453
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,389
aes number for a new customer I realize

454
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:42,129
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot type it in on your your</font>

455
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:43,899
favorite router and the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

456
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:45,759
definitely shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing is wait</font>

457
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:48,969
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get assigned something like 10</font>

458
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,740
to five four three two<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2009 and don't</font>

459
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:55,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any idea what to do with this</font>

460
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:57,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">number and with that aren't any</font>

461
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,928
questions

462
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:08,700
hi John Scudder juniper um you mentioned

463
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,149
about halfway back in your talk about

464
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:15,119
the representation format and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

465
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:17,488
do we use some dotted format or whatever

466
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:21,238
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it had been posed to the eye dr</font>

467
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:22,649
list and no consensus formed yep so i

468
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:25,980
guess i have an observation in a

469
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:27,360
question the observation is my reading

470
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,269
of the conversation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would on an ID</font>

471
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,219
are on the list it's true that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chair</font>

472
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:34,980
didn't you know declare consensus this

473
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,379
or that but the you know vast

474
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,889
preponderance of the comments were to

475
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:43,709
the effect of gene why can't we just use

476
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:45,570
a 32-bit integer just continue the

477
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,330
integer representation so that's my

478
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:51,539
observation is that to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye there was</font>

479
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,769
a consensus and then the question is why

480
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:59,850
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just use a integer</font>

481
00:23:52,769 --> 00:24:02,220
representation so yeah I well I think

482
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,439
that on the eye dr folks mainly people

483
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">spoke up who were in favor of the big</font>

484
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:11,309
integers and to answer your question

485
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:16,049
welder note i mean there's no really

486
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:20,158
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean there's no argument why you</font>

487
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:23,129
cannot use it a big number<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

488
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,929
personally think that a something a dot

489
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:27,539
B is a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> convenient just</font>

490
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:31,980
like you use got spot for 5p addresses

491
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:35,489
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no no argument in favor of</font>

492
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:39,359
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> notation on the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

493
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:41,249
I guess given that that conversation

494
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,889
doesn't really seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be over yet it</font>

495
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:45,690
might be useful for operator to chime in

496
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:47,789
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the eye dr list or any place that</font>

497
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is being floated unless the</font>

498
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:52,980
draft is just be withdrawn yeah i agree

499
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,749
i mean it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you if</font>

500
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,489
people have her feelings<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is</font>

501
00:24:54,749 --> 00:25:00,169

502
00:24:56,489 --> 00:25:03,239
door so we can close this issue thanks

503
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:05,580
hello aunt on katella five nines data

504
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:06,840
the gentleman standing behind me is

505
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to fill you in more in</font>

506
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,359
this but i wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out that of</font>

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,950
of this year first day of februari bill

508
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,720
posted a comment saying that the last

509
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,480
call resulted in consensus that this

510
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,150
tation is not desired on the data

511

tracker dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF that org website and</font>

512
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:25,470
I'm sure you can fill us in on the

513
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,929
remainder<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have don't read</font>

514
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:31,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so where did he post this but</font>

515
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:34,140
oh well we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it was my interpretation</font>

516
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion of the last call I</font>

517
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,039
mean if you if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the last call</font>

518
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,470
that happens there were a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

519
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,658
saying I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need this i</font>

520
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:48,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dots will cause trouble and a</font>

521
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:53,490
small number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people who i mean i</font>

522
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:55,440
think the arguments against are pretty

523
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,440
reasonable including the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

524
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,419
didn't see but that you experienced that

525
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> floating-point sometimes they would</font>

526
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,549
be silently interpreted as floating

527
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:09,299
point numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean that's pretty</font>

528
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:11,280
dangerous and then you know you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

529
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:15,690
quote them in regular expressions etc

530
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,299
etc and the argument for really is is

531
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,429
pretty weak how fast are we really going

532
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:23,850
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a s numbers that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

538
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:47,970
where be happens to be small so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

539
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I don't think there's a</font>

real<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong argument for the daughter</font>

542
00:26:52,559 --> 00:27:00,120
reasonable arguments against it and so

543
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:03,000
it would be nice to to see this actually

544
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,559
result if there are any strong arguments

545
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,559
for the dotted notation

far as the EMP notation is that

555
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:50,249
theoretically it could be possible to

actually carry information on the left

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">could work because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that limits the</font>
