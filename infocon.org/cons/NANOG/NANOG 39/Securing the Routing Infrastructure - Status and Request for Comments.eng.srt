and then down at the bottom anyone who

<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate authority certificate so</font>

54
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:43,850
what do you use to sign the road the

55
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,579
idea is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign a non CA certificate</font>

56
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,820
and end entities certificate that will

57
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,290
itself be used to sign the rowa so for

58
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,019
every prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce</font>

59
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,900
you generate one of these ends entity

60
00:02:54,019 --> 00:03:00,019
certificates that makes it possible to

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,440
revoke the rowa by revoking the

62
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:06,200
certificate that signed it it also means

63
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,690
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a whole bunch of</font>

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,940
prefixes that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce you</font>

65
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,500
generate one of these for every one of

66
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:17,799
the prefixes so you have control over

67
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,230
what gets announced to what without

68
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">combining and do faint cheering in a</font>

69
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,780
whole bunch of prefixes in one

70
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:28,850
certificate so the idea the the

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,040
discussions going on right now for what

72
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,540
a row of would contain is that it's

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,560
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end up being very</font>

74
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,980
simple a row of will authorize one<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp</font>

75
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:44,660
to announce your prefix and it'll be by

76
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:48,620
masked so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multihomed you sign</font>

77
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,739
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roiz that way if you're multi-home</font>

78
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,410
then you lose one of your agreements<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

79
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:58,040
don't have to revoke the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority</font>

80
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just create a new row afore the</font>

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,850
prefix or anyone else that you're going

82
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:09,109
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to there's a question right</font>

83
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:12,108
now that if an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP itself owns more than</font>

1a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s number whether we want to do that</font>

85
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:21,109
by listing the a SS in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aurora or by</font>

86
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:22,370
creating a<font color="#CCCCCC"> list of rows and then the</font>

87

prefixes

88
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,960
there's a discussion as to whether or

89
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,710
not the prefixes would actually be

90
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,710
represented in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the row itself because</font>

91
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,870
the end entity certificate itself says

92
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,409
what the prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's one and</font>

entities certificate for each<font color="#CCCCCC"> row the</font>

94
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,860
rowa doesn't actually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contain</font>

95
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,320
the prefix but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful for it</font>

96
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,340
to contain the prefix for purposes of

97
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:57,680
looking at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing what knowing what</font>

98
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:01,219
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about at the last ITF meeting we</font>

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,850
discussed the authorization model who

100
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,090
authorizes the advertisement of a prefix

101
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,030
the ripe model if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put a route object</font>

102
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,789
in the right database you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

103
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:18,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the authority of both the prefix holder</font>

104
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:20,840
and the AAS holder so if if you say that

105
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">AAS a hundred is allowed to advertise</font>

106
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,750
your prefix yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred has to say yep</font>

107
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,930
that's right the working group decided

108
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,389
that that wasn't necessary in the case

109
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:38,240
of the certificates that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">row is that we are defining then there</font>

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,000
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a a kind of back and forth</font>

112
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:47,870

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a route that is advertised must throw</font>

114
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:57,260
a exactly match that prefix or can it be

115
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:59,780
a superset of the prefix and the case

116
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,090
for making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it exact match is that it</font>

117
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,840
would prevent some accidental linkage

problems the case for making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

covering matches that it becomes you you

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,889
discussions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are taking place</font>

147
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,530
deciding what the content will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on</font>

148
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:38,509
what the hierarchy will look like is

149
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:41,669
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> made with the intent of</font>

150
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:44,940
facilitating operation and deployments

151
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:47,490
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> without a huge number of</font>

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,289
operators in the working group so

153
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,940
there's the working group charter you

154
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:54,300
can look at the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list archive</font>

155
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:59,370
there's the mailing list join up express

156
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:02,909
an opinion let us know if any of what is

157
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:06,620
being suggested is not going to work in

158
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,620
your current operational practices

159
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,909
questions yeah you have time for

160
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:17,520
questions and I see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> woodcock coming</font>

161
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:20,090
to the mic hi Sandy so um operators have

162
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:25,109
traditionally been pretty adverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

163
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:27,750
Evers to adding external dependencies

164
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,520
particularly ones which are by their

165
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,429
nature single points of failure yeah

166
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,429
this needn't by nature be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single point</font>

167
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">of failure so I'm curious whether you</font>

168
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:42,359
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just briefly address the pros and</font>

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">cons of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sintra a single centralized</font>

171
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,609
of trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is what the</font>

172
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,479
address delegation

173
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:55,660
looks like it all comes down in a rooted

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,550
hierarchy the resource pki<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

175
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,069
represented it here as if it were

176
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,750
exactly that same rooted hierarchy but

177
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,890
it is the intention of the site or

178
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:10,860
working group to make it possible to

179
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:10,860
represent other sorts of trust

180
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:18,700
mechanisms trust models<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you</font>

saying that you hold a prefix and other

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going to run in your bgp engine</font>

but rather in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> access list creation</font>

202
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,319
program where you have lots of ram and

203
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,870
lots of operator intervention to be able

<font color="#E5E5E5">to say oh but yeah i know they're</font>

207
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,360
always a local matter what you accept

208
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:35,170
what you do if you don't have a

209
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:42,970
certificate for prefix is going to be

210
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:46,269
totally up to the operators there are

211
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:50,380
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very strongly motivated</font>

212
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:52,720
or very strongly opinion that the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna</font>

213
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,740
single rooted model is not good and

214
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,720
that's why we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard to</font>

215
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,130
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it works with other trust</font>

Randy bush and I IJ as one of the people

218
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:12,410
actually implementing while admittedly

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:16,310
ignoring the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF um those some others</font>

are and Jeff and Rob playing the idea

<font color="#E5E5E5">from George um the centralization</font>

222
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,180
doesn't exist in the plan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

223
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,570
exist in the software that's being built

224
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:34,390
it's a bogeyman<font color="#E5E5E5"> um the fact is the</font>

225
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:37,540
address structure is hierarchically

226
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:42,319
allocated as you make very clear and

227
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:46,459
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to trust as origin</font>

228
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,390
data the ionophore saying to which

229
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:53,420
registry or which legacy they allocated

230
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,000
those data if you don't trust them to

231
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,130
say who they gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to then it all</font>

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,650
falls apart if you don't trust the

233
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:04,370
registry to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Aaron to say to</font>

234
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:08,900
them they gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to</font>

235
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:12,350
base anything on the current structure

236
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,390
for generating access lists and by the

237
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I intend to put this stuff in my</font>

238
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:20,689
routers and the current stuff to

239
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:23,420
generate access list in fact trusts some

240
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,750
horrible data that is centralized the

241
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,670
very few locations and yet we de limpiar

242
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,100
on it because we haven't got a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

243
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,310
other choices operators were pragmatic

244
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:37,370
what is the actual trust structure we

245
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,890
have today and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we trust the</font>

246
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:44,090
registries to say who gave this garbage

247
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:46,069
to and the recipient to say who they

248
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,070
gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to and that's life in the big</font>

249
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,960
city and yes the software will allow you

250
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:54,010
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure whatever trust anchors you</font>

251
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:57,980
want and are you going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be happy when</font>

252
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:00,710
somebody in Kansas decides to trust

eugenecash breath well that's your

254
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,020
choice I wouldn't trust him and there

255
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,070
are people in this room I wouldn't trust

256
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,960
okay I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're over you ten</font>

257
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,250
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so the mic is closed I can't</font>

258
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:15,290
take that question and I'm sorry

you're well over 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes thank</font>
