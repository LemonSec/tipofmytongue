1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,290
good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,270
talk about a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of recent developments</font>

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,890
in the ethernet and it kind of ties<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,840
some of the tutorials and other talks

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,750
that we've had here so it's almost like

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">we planned it this way i found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,150
diagram which I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie like that Bob</font>

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,180
Metcalfe drew in 1972 and so now it's

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,009
about 28 years later and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out he</font>

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,310
was kind of right so we do see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,490
almost everywhere you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,989
mile into<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless and obviously data</font>

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,769
center and networks like that so

14
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:37,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically this is going to be a</font>

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,649
whirlwind talk we have 58 slides in 28

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,809
minutes or 25 minutes but it's okay

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,789
we've done this<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and no one died</font>

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,989
but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you</font>

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,420
an overview<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all the stuff that's</font>

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,800
going on with some references<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,120
you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the stuff that's</font>

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,410
interesting to you and your spare time

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,349
but there is actually a lot of stuff

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,148
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on we have 1400 gig Ethernet that</font>

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,039
is now the standard is now done we have

26
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tripoli which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is energy-efficient</font>

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet we have a lot of carrier</font>

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,459
ethernet and OEM tools that are now

29
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,439
available then we have the old data

30
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,939
center bridging and shortest path

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,830
forwarding for layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

32
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,339
kind of talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those and brief</font>

33
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,390
and go kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of quickly first I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">start out with the slides for all the</font>

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,259
standards organizations because I got a

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,939
lot of these meetings and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

37
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these people and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

38
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,529
organizations so I kind of try to draw

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,860
this as an OSI model where the the

40
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,210
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of the physical layer so</font>

41
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,100
that's the components and interface

42
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,869
standards that's called the oif and then

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,000
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the stack you have the</font>

44
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,470
fibre channel yeah the I Triple E which

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,909
makes the ethernet standards then you

46
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,039
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU which makes the telecom</font>

47
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,409
standards and you move<font color="#E5E5E5"> up higher in the</font>

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,299
stack<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you get the IETF and then the</font>

49
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Metro Ethernet forum and then at the</font>

50
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,049
very top are you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers so</font>

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,850
the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out is that as</font>

52
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,220
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> move higher and higher up the stack</font>

53
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,530
of standards organizations we see more

54
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,969
involvement by service fighters<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

55
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,860
internet exchanges so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metro</font>

56
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet form in particular where</font>

57
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,119
they're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on service definitions</font>

58
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,950
and standards for Ethernet services we

59
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,450
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of service' fighters and now a</font>

60
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,409
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of internet exchange is involved</font>

61
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,020
because of the carrier ethernet

62
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,239
exchanges that people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix</font>

63
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,350
intelex are doing so you can kind of

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,250
refer back to the slide

65
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,500
as I throw out the standards acronyms

66
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,720
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1400 gig Ethernet at</font>

67
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,790
first so we're done I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been talking</font>

68
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for about five years so I'm</font>

69
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,840
very excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are almost</font>

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,730
to the state of shipping product the

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,110
standard was pretty much done this

72
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,209
spring and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to go through some</font>

73
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,300
formalities it was approved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in June and</font>

74
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,540
it's a whopping 457 pages long so it's a

75
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,360
massive set of standards for both<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 100</font>

76
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,459
gig Ethernet this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our the sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

77
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,140
target applications and just because I

78
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,790
say target applications doesn't mean

79
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,649
that someone won't use the technology

80
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,620
you know in other places we always find

81
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,120
interesting ways to t to be creative

82
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,280
when we design our networks but this is

83
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically where we think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be</font>

84
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,130
used for t 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig 40 gig is basically</font>

85
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,200
targeted towards data center application

86
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,940
so made a data center core especially

87
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,750
towards top of rack and blade server

88
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:13,290
access as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers get faster and the</font>

89
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,390
pci bus increases we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll</font>

90
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,239
need 40 gig sometime in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

91
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,679
years also maybe for a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> campus core</font>

92
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,300
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our gig on the</font>

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,430
other hand it's really targeted for

94
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,230
large service fighter networks or a

95
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,110
large data center aggregation large

96
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,940
campus cores and things like that here's

97
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,520
a slide that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i keep updating and it gets</font>

98
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,870
denser and denser and harder to read so

99
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">i hope you can see in the back the thing</font>

100
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out here is that i</font>

101
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">added a price row so this stuff turns</font>

102
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,390
out it's a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive</font>

103
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,000
than we thought it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be especially</font>

104
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">as we get into longer reach hunter gig</font>

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,350
optics it's just very insanely expensive

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,330
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

107
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,970
more but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the physical</font>

108
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,540
specifications and the type of media

109
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using for 1400 gig so</font>

110
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,410
second generation technology even though

111
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,970
I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard was just approved in</font>

112
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,620
June we're already starting to work on

113
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,750
new things and that's good because we

114
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,700
want we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> new technology to evolve as</font>

115
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,770
we as it becomes feasible so the

116
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard is really flexible just like 10</font>

117
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,049
gig where we had I don't know cx4 and

118
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,640
10g<font color="#CCCCCC"> bass-t and all this stuff evolve</font>

119
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,320
over time the same thing what happened

120
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,719
with 40 and 100 gig there's already a

121
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,360
new project in the I Triple E to do a 40

122
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,550
gig serial for<font color="#CCCCCC"> two kilometer and then we</font>

123
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">also expect</font>

124
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,379
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be two new call for interests</font>

125
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,330
later this year to do a shorter reach

126
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:35,720
copper cable and a backplane Ethernet

127
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:38,628
that uses 25 gigs signaling possibly a

128
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,970
low-cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-kilometre module that would</font>

129
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,849
use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> x 25 signaling and then a new</font>

130
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,889
optic called qsfp to which is still

131
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">being defined the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

132
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,409
going on is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the standards-based</font>

133
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,889
optics are so insanely expensive and I

134
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:57,139
mean list prices of of several tens of

135
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,610
thousands of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars there is a very</font>

136
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">strong interest in the operator</font>

137
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,539
community to support a non-standard

138
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,400
low-cost optic that uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten-by-ten</font>

139
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:07,250
signaling that would go up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to</font>

140
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">four kilometers so I think that'll be</font>

141
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

142
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,979
investigate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that could possibly come</font>

143
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,449
out as a multi-source agreement that

144
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,609
would be a non-standard from the I

145
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,889
Triple E so interesting developments

146
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,840
there as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as what's going on beyond</font>

147
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,759
right now what's keeping us from making

148
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,138
cheaper interfaces is the fact that

149
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,090
inside the box for chip-to-chip

150
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:29,389
communications we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have three</font>

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">six or 10 gig Surtees and components</font>

152
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:33,199
that we can use inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box what we</font>

153
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,810
really need is faster signaling inside

154
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,029
the box to get rid of all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 by 10</font>

155
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,250

156
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:42,289
aggregation on electrical interfaces so

157
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oif that's the standards</font>

158

159
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,990
is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some really fundamental 25</font>

161
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,560
the way that we do things so when we

162
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,240
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of signaling will see a</font>

164
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,949
that will use a true for by 25 gig

interface from electrical to optical

166
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:03,169
right now we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 by 10 electrical</font>

167
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:05,229
that converted into<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 right 25 optical</font>

168
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,909
which adds a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of costs and components</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far as what's going beyond we'd like</font>

172
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:16,279
technology and economics i mean we could

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,289
build it but people are already having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

hard time affording 100 gig Ethernet and

terribly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet would be pretty much</font>

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:26,539

179
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,249
idea that's really being kicked around

180
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,109
by now bye

181
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:36,209
network operators and I think we'll see

182
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:38,308
you know some some more evolution next

183
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:40,169
couple years but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's clear that as far</font>

184
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:41,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">as Ethernet there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of demand for</font>

185
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,429
it in different form factors and

186
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:45,959
eventually I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll see a true</font>

187
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:47,339
serial<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunter gig though it may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

188
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,039
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of our</font>

189
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,389
technology all right what should you

190
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,549
expect this year there's lots of

191
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,979
announcements for companies have started

192
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:57,929
to announce<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or ship hunter gig</font>

193
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,878
interfaces and there's one company

194
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:01,378
that's doing 40 gigs so I just want to

195
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as where we see</font>

196
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technology going and like I said</font>

197
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:07,318
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of expensive so here's a chart</font>

198
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:10,529
that I drew based on the historical

199
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,389
prices of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten and one gig Ethernet and</font>

200
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,339
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first couple</font>

201
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:17,099
years the prices dropped by almost

202
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:18,629
almost half for over half in some cases

203
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,878
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that the same thing is going</font>

204
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,919
to happen with 1400 gig based on the

205
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,629
historical pricing like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

206
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,159
optics are really what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

207
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,199
expensive right now because there's no

208
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:30,389
volume I mean the optics manufacturers

209
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,969
are practically making in my hand and we

210
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,189
may sell we meaning the industry may

211
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:37,259
sell a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these interfaces this</font>

212
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,809
year or next year so when you have that

213
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,479
kind of low volume there's just no no

214
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:44,189
cost benefit in volume production and

215
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,619
then second generation technology like I

216
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,419
said will allow us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do denser</font>

217
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:50,339
interfaces and lower the prices too

218
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,709
here's some references I'll just kind of

219
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,149
skip over these all right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

220
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,709
efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet this is I think a</font>

221
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting new technology that</font>

222
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:02,129
probably hasn't gotten a whole lot of

223
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know press or interest in the</font>

224
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">operator community I think it's</font>

225
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:07,559
interesting though because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power</font>

226
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:09,269
consumption so what it does basically is

227
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:11,339
introduced as a mechanism that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

228
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,139
reduce power consumption on the link

229
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,419
during periods when it's not used and

230
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,849
you can see this where I hope you can

231
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,058
see this chart from Intel and you notice

232
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:22,558
that an idol in a line rate interface

233
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:24,599
really uses about the same power but if

234
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:27,360
you run an interface at say ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> Meg</font>

235
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,579
versus one gig you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> save a lot</font>

236
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,889
of power so the idea is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your</font>

237
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,930
CPU scales back when it's kind of idle

238
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:36,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that we're going to scale back the</font>

239
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:38,159
speed of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network interface to</font>

240
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:40,078
transmit at the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy efficient</font>

241
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,299
speed possible so the standard was just

242
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:44,098
approved last week and I think it'll

243
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while because this has to go</font>

244
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,660
actually into the silicon I think it

245
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">will</font>

246
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">could a while before we see products but</font>

247
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,970
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> estimate that we see something in</font>

248
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,410
probably 2011 or or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even sooner so</font>

249
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this works like i said is</font>

250
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,699
if you're transmitting say a couple

251
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,470
megabytes then you run the link at 10

252
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:03,689
meg if you're transmitting a couple

253
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,759
hundred megabytes you run the link at

254
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:08,219
100 meg and if you're going beyond that

255
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,629
then you run the link at a gig also

256
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,089
there's times when you're actually not

257
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:14,339
transmitting anything so like on a voice

258
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,529
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP connection for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may</font>

259
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,569
only transmit something once every 10 or

260
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:21,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 milliseconds so you can actually idle</font>

261
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:22,649
the link for several milliseconds when

262
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,930
there's no traffic descent so there's

263
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,519
two things is the speed selection and

264
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,079
then the low power Idol and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

265
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically how it works everything looks</font>

266
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,709
like normal obviously we can't flap the

267
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:34,470
link and things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the link is</font>

268
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:36,750
always up there those frames are dropped

269
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,120
and or corrupted obviously and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

270
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,949
time has to be transparent so we're

271
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,579
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> millisecond transition</font>

272
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:46,439
times between 10 and tunner door even

273
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:48,209
gig speeds just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your CPU does like</font>

274
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said and this is the interesting thing</font>

275
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,018
is because if you're already turning off

276
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network interface then there's also</font>

277
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,920
other components and servers that you

278
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,170
could turn off so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

279
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,579
turn off CPU cores because you know your

280
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,110
network interface is off and there's

281
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:03,750
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send or receive so you might</font>

282
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,670
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well turn off your CPU you could I</font>

283
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,139
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know turn down some memories that</font>

284
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,939
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to keep refreshing it or</font>

285
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,850
things like that so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will</font>

286
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:14,160
lead to other areas and server design

287
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,529
that will lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a lot more efficient</font>

288
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,689
utilization and then the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

289
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,209

290
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:23,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto-negotiation so obviously there's</font>

291
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,989
mechanisms to set servers at a

292
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,079
particular speed or there will be

293
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,269
because some servers you may never<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

294
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,500
to do this this negotiation so I think

295
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:33,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really interesting this good</font>

297
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,229
talks about so in the background and

298
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,639
some of the power efficiencies and

299
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,740
savings that we think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get but you</font>

300
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,660
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you imagine that large companies</font>

301
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,949
have several hundred thousand servers

302
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,360
and if we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

305
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:53,969
switching this is a new standards based

00:10:55,439 --> 00:11:00,250
probably has their own propriety

309

technology but this is finally a usable

standard standards based protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,760
their no need for any hardware changes

315
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,219
or anything like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's relatively</font>

316
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,260
easy to implement the first standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

317
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,180
done a couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and basically</font>

318
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,189
everyone's proprietary implementation

319
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,530
was a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think anyone</font>

320
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,210
actually used it the second version the

321
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,130
standard was done this summer and it

322
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,810
actually has you know it makes networks

323
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,189
usable with multiple instances and

324
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,520
interconnecting rings and things like

325
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itu reference if</font>

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:40,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're interested in more about it ok</font>

327
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:43,390

328
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,360
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing well so Carrie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethan has has</font>

329
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,920
gotten a lot of interest in the recent

330
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,960
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years I'd say number one from</font>

331
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,670
just a transport technology and then we

332
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,080
saw these<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carrier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet exchanges</font>

333
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,540
coming online where they're actually

334
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to exchange circuits over a</font>

335
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,569
switch and we have this organization

336
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,200
called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metra net ethernet forum</font>

337
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,580
which defines the services and

338
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,410
attributes that Kira<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet has that</font>

339
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,690
differentiates it from a traditional

340
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,510
sale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet so there's a couple</font>

341
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,490
things standardized services scalability

342
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,470
obviously you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell services in</font>

343
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,180
different increments reliability quality

344
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,640
of service and then service management

345
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,859
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a big piece and I have a whole</font>

346
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,290
section on the OEM mechanisms because

347
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,290
it's so critical for carriers to provide

348
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:29,829
that TDM or sonnet like OEM that they're

349
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,719
used to so the MAF to find several

350
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,730
services and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

351
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,380
the service providers actually involved

352
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,570
in these service definitions and then

353
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,189
you can become certified so it's good

354
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,890
because Carrie Ethernet is sort of a

355
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,000
vague term just like cloud computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

356
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,280
and it means a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

357
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,770
different people so the MAF can actually

358
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,839
certify equipment and the MAF will also

359
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,750
certify a network so you can buy

360
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,560
certified equipment go to a certified

361
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,420
network and then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

362
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting so customers always get the same</font>

363
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,170
thing the basic unit is called an

364
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet virtual connection which is</font>

365
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,400
just a point-to-point VC basically and

366
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,530
we can do a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things we</font>

367
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,140
can do the e line which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just point to</font>

368
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:10,170
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> elana's multi-point and then e</font>

369
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,350
tree is a rooted multi point where

370
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,479
the root can talk to all the nodes nodes

371
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,130
can talk to the root but they can't talk

372
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,050
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other and here's some more</font>

373
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,019
slides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will skip that go into more</font>

374
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,550
detail about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works so we're</font>

375
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,339
going to skip all this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go</font>

376
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,649
straight to the summary an interest of

377
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,630
time here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the carrier</font>

378
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:34,680
ethernet technology that we see on the

379
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,730
market today we have mpls mpls-tp<font color="#CCCCCC"> p BB &</font>

380
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,109
p BB te mpls is a very well-established

381
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,940
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started do an MPLS</font>

382
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,310
interrupt test I think back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in two</font>

383
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,470
thousand and their deployments even

384
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,359
before that so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the Swiss</font>

385
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:52,500
Army knife of providing services you can

386
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,600
provide IP l2 l3 VPN services the

387
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,660
standards are mature and there's a lot

388
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,670
of development going on mpls-tp is a

389
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,760
carrier ethernet service that's really

390
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:05,339
focused on transport level mpls so it's

391
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,939
really designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do sort of just</font>

392
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,709
circuit level mpls and it's a work in

393
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,870
progress in the ITF is getting a lot of

394
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:17,489
interest by carriers especially for

395
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,290
mobile backhaul applications for example

396
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,390
where they need circuit like emulations

397
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,420
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet but they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

398
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,310
need all the complexity that IP bring so

399
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,680
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just mpls for circuits</font>

400
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,439
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a market</font>

401
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,479
trend PBB and pbbt e on the other hand

402
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,160
are really just designed to do carrier

403
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,380
ethernet services over<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet they</font>

404
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,689
don't have the multi service capability

405
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,250
that mpls brings and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really why</font>

406
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,709
from our perspective we see limited

407
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">deployment and and just not really a</font>

408
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:48,390
market trend and there's no future

409
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,100
development either so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had someone</font>

410
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask me I went to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier ethernet</font>

411
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,180
what should I use I would definitely say

412
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,529
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at mpls because that's</font>

413
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,359
the mature standard it's very widely

414
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:00,750
implemented and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said before</font>

415
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,569
there's a lot going on with mpls so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pbte</font>

416
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think BTW was really interested in</font>

417
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,319
doing that with her 21cn<font color="#CCCCCC"> network a</font>

418
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,050
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and then turned out to</font>

419
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:12,180
be not such a good idea so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

420
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">people kind of stopped talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

421
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:19,410
there's a bunch of references so let's

422
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:21,390
talk about OEM so om is really being

423
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,189
driven by the carrier ethernet services

424
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,410
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally have</font>

425
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,930
for many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years a complete protocol</font>

426
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:31,140
stack of OEM capabilities from layer 2

427
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,670
up to mpls IP and even the VPN layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

428
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,880
remember when we were first doing mpls

429
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:38,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">interop tests back in 2001</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we</font>

430
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">came we all came together with our gear</font>

431
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we SAT there we plugged it in the</font>

432
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,619
LSP came up for you know a few minutes

433
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">or a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and we watched the</font>

434
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,680
blinking lights we had no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

435
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,780
telling if there was actually traffic

436
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,760
going over the LSP so now we finally

437
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,500
have mechanisms that can do that that

438
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,000
are standards-based and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

439
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,070
before this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really trying to emulate</font>

440
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,500
some of the TDM and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sonic capabilities</font>

441
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,090
that the carriers are used to and that

442
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,610
they want for their their carrier

443
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,540
ethernet services here's basically how

444
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,220
it works we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple different</font>

445
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,079
services if you look at a network a

446
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,720
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on the first is that</font>

447
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,930
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three h which is a link level 0</font>

448
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,400
am so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is designed just to</font>

449
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,489
troubleshoot and diagnose problems on a

450
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,140
particular link let me move up the stack

451
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then we have service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh am so</font>

452
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,100
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> two two standards for this</font>

453
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a tour to that one AG and then I</font>

454
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,780
tu<font color="#E5E5E5"> y 1713 these provide end-to-end</font>

455
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,570
service OEM so you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

456
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,030
trace routes and pings and the other

457
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,160
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the packets also take the</font>

458
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,020
OEM packets take the same paths that

459
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,969
customer data takes so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not anything</font>

460
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,490
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of band it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an in-band</font>

461
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,580
mechanism to do OEM and troubleshooting

462
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,460
and then the core of course we have IP

463
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,690
and mpls<font color="#CCCCCC"> william i'm going to skip</font>

464
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">through these because we kind of talked</font>

465
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,770
about them the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out</font>

466
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:55,080
about 1730 one is that it's this

467
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,640
functionality is very similar to 80 to

468
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,190
that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ag and in some senses it's</font>

469
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,380
competing standard the thing that 1731

470
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,930
as on top of that is measurement so you

471
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,449
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do SLA is now and you can</font>

472
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,859
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do end and latency testing to</font>

473
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,810
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what your customers are</font>

474
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,729
seeing and in fact it supports hardware

475
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,230
timestamps so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're routing</font>

476
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,740
equipment supports that you can actually

477
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,180
get down to millisecond granularity on

478
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,880
round trips and delay so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

479
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:24,600
important for SLA monitoring and also

480
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,730
verification<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay talk about data center</font>

481
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,620
bridging so we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this already</font>

482
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,030
a lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel yesterday when we</font>

483
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,159
debated trill<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus shortest path</font>

484
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,590
bridging so I just kind of summarize but

485
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,779
basically the driver for this is convert

486
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,039
virgins of sand and land fabrics and

487
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:40,919
there are a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do</font>

488
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:43,289
to make sand storage traffic actually go

489
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,299
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet and be happy so there's</font>

490
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,470
two things and Donald<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the same</font>

491
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,879
thing yesterday there's really two

492
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,710
things there's data center bridging and

493
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,690
then shortest path forwarding which are

494
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:56,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be combined technologies that</font>

495
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,049
will use for a data center fabric this

496
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,150
is what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to do is a</font>

497
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:02,100
converged network adapter which supports

498
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,110
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet and Fibre Channel over</font>

499
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,959
Ethernet could be used in a data center

500
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:13,799
to send both fibre channel traffic and

501
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:15,929
IP traffic the basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of data center</font>

502
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,789
Ethernet is that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change it to</font>

503
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,380
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry fibre channel traffic and</font>

504
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:21,210
fibre channel traffic has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

505
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,429
characteristics number one it's very

506
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,230
finicky and sensitive to latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LA</font>

507
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,820
so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking about the ring</font>

508
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,880
protection protocol which has 50

509
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,320
milliseconds failover well fibre channel

510
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,929
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of laugh at that because</font>

511
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,059
they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two millisecond</font>

512
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:39,419
latency and failover<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it just can't</font>

513
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:41,940
tolerate any packet loss for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet we</font>

514
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:44,010
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and IP which we put on top of</font>

515
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so people were asking me well does</font>

516
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have lost our net</font>

517
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:50,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">today well no it doesn't i mean if you</font>

518
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,990
put a packet on the wire if the hardware

519
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,850
is working correctly it'll come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on</font>

520
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,500
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> end correctly what we're</font>

521
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,840
saying is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber channel doesn't</font>

522
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any retransmission mechanisms so</font>

523
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,730
from its perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet needs to</font>

524
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,168
be lossless what fibre channel does when

525
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,610
the switch comes on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is that</font>

526
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it negotiates with all the other</font>

527
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,600
switches on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

528
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,639
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserve buffers and credits so</font>

529
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,709
that they know exactly how much data

530
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,600
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send to the network at one time</font>

531
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,029
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't have that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP or IP</font>

532
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,049
so we're really trying to make Ethernet

533
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:24,149
carry fibre channel traffic and that's

534
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:25,320
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general idea here there's</font>

535
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:28,529
three new enhancements which we'll talk

536
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,939
about in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next couple slides which</font>

537
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:31,260
were also mentioned yesterday the first

538
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,700
is priority flow control<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

539
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,620
important because<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now if you have</font>

540
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,559
an ethernet pause frame it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

541
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,939
stops all traffic on the wire so what

542
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,389
fibre channel needs is actually a

543
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,220
priority so PFC introduces a perk you

544
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,020
flow control mechanism so you can have

545
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,330
traffic flowing and say your highest

546
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,370
priority queues and you can

547
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,169
pause frame on the wire for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lower</font>

548
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,030
priority queues and that would allow the

549
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,420
fibre channel traffic to continue to go

550
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:58,910
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of congestion the other thing</font>

551
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,560
that's important is intense transmission

552
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,450
selection was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is a terrible</font>

553
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,899
acronym but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the</font>

554
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to group traffic together into a</font>

555
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,490
higher priority group and a certain

556
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,720
bandwidth so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before when</font>

557
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,640
fibre channel switches come on the

558
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,380
network they negotiate credits and

559
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,820
buffers and things like that this is

560
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,620
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to emulate that mechanism</font>

561
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,419
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> channel traffic knows</font>

562
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,909
exactly how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you can send and</font>

563
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,340
receive without losing your over running

564
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,380
any buffers and the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called</font>

565
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,689
congestion notification this works

566
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,250
together with priority flow control when

567
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,720
there's congestion so it basically would

568
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,580
put a pause frame on the wire for that

569
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,860
cube and then it sends<font color="#CCCCCC"> the congestion</font>

570
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,240
notification to the ingress the ingress

571
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,699
gets it and says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

572
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate limit that flow and then when the</font>

573
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,520
congestion period is over then it goes

574
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">full throttle again it was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

575
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
references there that you can read them

576
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,540
out and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last thing we're going</font>

577
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about is shortest path</font>

578
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,920
forwarding and there's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a</font>

579
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">great panel and a great set of tutorials</font>

580
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,590
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already covered most of this</font>

581
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,320
so we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of be brief but</font>

582
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,490
basically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the network today with</font>

583
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,530
spanning tree and you notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

584
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,520
there's a lot of red and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

585
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that because it's really</font>

586
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,629
inefficient you can do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

587
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,370
multiple spanning trees to load balanced

588
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,790
traffic but it's really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

589
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:16,100
to to do that and you know I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

590
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,860
anyone likes that and the other thing

591
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,959
too is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no no hop count so</font>

592
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,790
with wire speed forwarding when there's

593
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,500
a loop in your network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

594
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,180
going to board<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fast the other</font>

595
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,190
thing too is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> during convergence</font>

596
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,510
there could be periods of flooding and

597
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,400
when we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage traffic on the</font>

598
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,650
network that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad idea so</font>

599
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,820
flooding storage traffic not a good

600
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,440
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the storage people get really</font>

601
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,090
unhappy when we talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this is</font>

602
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,730
what we really want to do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

603
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,639
have a layer to multipath network that

604
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,470
has low sharing and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster</font>

605
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,700
responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> to failure so a spanning tree</font>

606
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,620
you have to go through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

607
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,080
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> network recompute we don't really</font>

608
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">like them obviously this gives us a lot</font>

609
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">of improvements in utilization and</font>

610
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,570
bandwidth efficiency and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing</font>

611
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,980
is that is actually backwards compatible

612
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,320
with is<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting infrastructure you</font>

613
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">could have a trill cloud that as</font>

614
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,230
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a spanning tree cloud and</font>

615
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:04,820
everything would be half there's two

616
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,679
standards there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true and shortest path</font>

617
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,299
bridging which we both<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about in</font>

618
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,159
detail I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show this picture there</font>

619
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:13,940
is ratty<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pearlman doing something very</font>

620
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting and then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fast-forward to</font>

621
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the summary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the last slide I</font>

622
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:20,299
want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at from a</font>

623
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,559
technology perspective trill is really

624
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,600
being developed for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center</font>

625
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:25,279
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see it move into</font>

626
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">other areas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network after the</font>

627
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,600
standard is done but right now it's

628
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:31,429
really developed as a data center of

629
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,860
fabric application shortest path

630
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:36,080
bridging has data center applications

631
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,139
but it's also designed since it works on

632
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,480
PBB it's also designed for layer to VPN

633
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:42,799
and carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet services the data</font>

634
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,750
plane is a little bit different trill

635
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,059
actually has a trill packet that it uses

636
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,159
to encapsulate layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 frames and then</font>

637
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:52,158
the mac address has changed on each hop

638
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,830
just like a layer 2<font color="#E5E5E5"> or layer 3 IP packet</font>

639
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,360
is routed right now the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane for</font>

640
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,750
shortest path bridging on the other hand

641
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,269
is encapsulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the original frame</font>

642
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,190
into a backbone ethernet frame so it

643
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:05,799
doesn't actually touch the frame as it

644
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,210
goes to the network whereas trill

645
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,799
decrements the hop count and other

646
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,690
things as the frame goes the network the

647
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,240
control plane they're both based on is

648
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is they have both have loot mitigation</font>

649
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,470
trill has the hop count and shortest

650
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,049
path bridging doesn't RPF check they do

651
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,720
the cmp multicast you can use them with

652
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,820
data center ethernet and then really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

653
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,320
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we see shortest path</font>

654
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,820
bridging as a trend huawei and

655
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,710
alcatel-lucent have basically been the

656
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,720
only companies that I've seen talk about

657
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,120
shortest path bridging and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

658
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's more for a metro ethernet or</font>

659
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,168
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two carrier ethernet service</font>

660
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,669
application those two companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't</font>

661
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,710
really strong players in the data center

662
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,480
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think just from a market</font>

663
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,009
perspective there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more people</font>

664
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,080
behind trill in the data center than

665
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:50,509
there are for shortest path bridging and

666
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,189
I think we'll see definitely trill

667
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:54,500
implementations as Donald mentioned

668
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:57,259
yesterday there's already a interrupt

669
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,970
belief event that happened in August at

670
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,830
UNH so that's good i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see the</font>

671
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,480
standard by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end the year standard</font>

672
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,059
for shortest path bridging they just

673
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,039
went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft 320 in june so it's</font>

674
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,210
making progress but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the final</font>

675
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,540
standard is going to be middle to late

676
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:14,110
next year and then we'll see you know in

677
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:20,580
patient after that here's references and

678
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:20,580
that was it so that was 59 slides I

679
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:45,550
going to need a nap<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this you can</font>

680
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:47,830
breed we have time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some questions hi</font>

681
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:51,100
Greg hey Ted let who ought there's

682
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:54,550
pushing p BB te know anybody I don't

683
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pushing it just</font>

684
00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:00,610
from our perspective we don't have any

685
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,530
customers asking us for pbbt and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

686
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're going to implement it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm</font>

687
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just curious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

688
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,480
customers asking us for<font color="#CCCCCC"> pdb but no one</font>

689
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,400
wants the thing about pbte that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

690
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:20,380
of skipped over is that all the

691
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:23,290
provisioning is manual and so I think

692
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> adds a lot of complexity because</font>

693
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,210
you have to have each so each switch

694
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,290
along the way it has to be provisioned

695
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,640
by the by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> management agent so it's I</font>

696
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,290
think open flow is kind of interesting

697
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it almost has the same kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

698
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,909
concept where it wants to provision you

699
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,230
know each each flow along the hop so

700
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,520
there could be some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

701
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,490
applications but I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

702
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:52,330
that's asking us for it in particular

703
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:55,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool thank you any more questions well</font>

704
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,560
let's thank Greg again
