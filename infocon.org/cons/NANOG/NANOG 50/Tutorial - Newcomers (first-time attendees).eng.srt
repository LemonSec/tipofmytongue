there and I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mick out of</font>

285
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">peter going have a picture of peter</font>

286
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:42,019
klein later as well and then the black

287
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:43,610
one means that you you were doing

288
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,990
network security so these are these are

289
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,149
the guys with the black helicopters and

290
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,100
stuff so they have a black dot and they

291
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:52,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are security</font>

292
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">barf on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon but that</font>

293
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,070
generally means they're the upset

294
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:00,050
contact for that for that organization

295
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,250
so I try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense of the agenda so</font>

296
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,400
I'd sort of spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font>

297
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,340
before the general session everybody get

298
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,340
everybody's in the same room that's the

299
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">majority of it how people get talks</font>

300
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,840
there is that they we do a call<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

301
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,090
presentations they submit talks into a

302
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,590
tool that we have online and then

303
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,810
program committee get together on a

304
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,760
conference call can be quite a long

305
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,290
conference call sometimes and we'll go

306
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,819
through all the talks and will rape them

307
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,890
and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do is we'll</font>

308
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,080
basically pick the best talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I r if</font>

309
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,370
there's a talk that we think is it's got

310
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,110
promised but it needs some guidance

311
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,180
somebody from the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee will</font>

312
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,340
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned to go work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that speaker</font>

313
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,199
and certain to nurse that that talk into

314
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,590
actually making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the it making it</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was that they would</font>

426
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,830
discuss things that were didn't come up

427
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,270
regularly what we found is some things

428
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,800
that were boss were coming up pretty

429
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">much every meeting and there was</font>

430
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,280
interest in them coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> every meeting</font>

431
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,560
so they've sort of become tracks in

432
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,459
their own right so we break apart into

433
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,589
these different tracks peering security

434
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,030
there's a track on I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> open flow this to</font>

435
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this meeting which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an interesting</font>

437
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,420
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our any environment but I think</font>

438
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,130
it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a network on ops</font>

439
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,459
perspective as well because it gives you

440
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:11,610
a sort of like a little API into<font color="#E5E5E5"> house</font>

481
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,280
quite topical or a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in there'll be a queue</font>

483
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,580
forming at the mics around the room and

it's up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person who's who's</font>

485
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,820

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">eye on the mics look at how long the</font>

490
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">also to close the lines off at the</font>

491
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,390
microphones because what<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise we</font>

496
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">be put off by asking questions</font>

497
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:17,600
everybody's got interesting stuff to say

498
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:19,340
I think I'm vendor collaboration it

499
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,719
sounds like vendor collaboration what

500
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,340
happens in the vendor collaboration room

501
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,620
is the vendor collaboration room only

502
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,879
for vendors is it a smoke-filled room

503
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,110
where they collaborate about how much

504
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,350
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to charge you for things</font>

505
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,490
and and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how many bugs they're</font>

506
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,580
going to release this this is this

507
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">quarter it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a technology into</font>

508
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">rock room it's had a lot of focus</font>

509
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:42,949
recently on v6 v6 technologies v6 cpe

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,459
other end of the down the other end of

515

the corridor down the other end of this

516
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,800
floor it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually nice rule everything</font>

00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is on one floor compare it to the</font>

518
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,740
the meeting in Austin where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

519
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,409
were split pretty much over three floors

520
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,570
and

521
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,950
people were like tucked away<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was</font>

522
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,659
like well nobody came and visited the

523
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,450
vendor collaboration room because nobody

524
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">could find it I think it didn't get that</font>

525
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,290
many people but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this rule on one floor</font>

526
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,610
here and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to find stuff and</font>

527
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's useful to go and see particularly</font>

528
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,479
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to be doing some some</font>

529
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,490
work in this area<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna talk to talk to</font>

530
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,320
people demonstrating I have this stuff

531
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,710
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually working together and hang</font>

532
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,210
out across multi-platform and this was

533
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,310
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the one that</font>

534
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,190
Philadelphia where the guys from comcast

535
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:39,970
had got a v6 technology demonstrator

536
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:42,490
using some using some cisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> cnts gear</font>

537
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,100
and some cpe to actually show how they

538
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,290
could run dual stack into into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the road</font>

539
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">into a property so they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically built</font>

540
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,580
a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> c mts and cable network actually</font>

541
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,350
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room in the hotel which was</font>

542
00:19:51,580 --> 00:20:00,879
quite cool beer and gear it's our monday

543
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,320
night evening evening social it's this

544
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,540
one way that we engage in our industry

545
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,010
vendor sponsors one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you won't</font>

546
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,960
find in an analog is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't find</font>

547
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,670
people slick marketing guys from the

548
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,250
vendors stood on the platform trying to

549
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,480
sell you things we're really careful to

550
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,700
try and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there's no marketing</font>

551
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,320
loss in the slides and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

552
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,870
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just real technical substance</font>

553
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,750
so one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do do is the</font>

554
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,040
marketing guys can come with their kit

555
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,170
