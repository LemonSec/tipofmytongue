157
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:45,909
technology business event and I had the

158
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:49,329
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to listen to aaron patzer</font>

159
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:52,839
who is the CEO of mint.com or was the

160
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:54,219
CEO and<font color="#E5E5E5"> founder of mint.com and if you</font>

00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,019
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> erener you never heard him he</font>

162
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:57,819
has multiple engineering degrees from

163
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:00,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">Duke University just a brilliant</font>

164
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,679
brilliant engineer and he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

165
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:03,669
that really put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in perspective to me he</font>

166
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:06,068
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as you're building a</font>

167
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:07,869
company and growing a company every

168
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,449
engineer and technical individual like

169
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:12,759
yourselves can add five hundred thousand

170
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,819
dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> in valuation to a company and</font>

171
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,469
every business guy like myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

172
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,329
can lower that valuation by a hundred

173
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,979
and fifty thousand dollars so you guys

174
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:22,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">have really created a hell of a lot of</font>

175
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,859
valuation for your companies so I think

176
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,089
you should give yourselves a<font color="#CCCCCC"> round of</font>

177
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,129
applause for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've done for the</font>

178
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:32,379
industry so a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things just why</font>

179
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:35,050
telex participates in<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanna real quickly</font>

00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:37,239
um you know you guys have having

181
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,639
participated<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this event for several</font>

182
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:42,698
years you get right down to business and

183
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,949
discussions there's no BS you discuss

184
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:47,259
the technical issues around the internet

185
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:49,719
and IP in general you<font color="#CCCCCC"> dialogue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

186
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,279
facilitate great discussion and most

187
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,769
importantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> of great training and</font>

188
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,629
educational programs and right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

189
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:57,610
know we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of challenges out</font>

190
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:59,259
there and I know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're</font>

191
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,969
proud of participating in conversing

192
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,009
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you folks on is you're going to</font>

193
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:05,489
discuss many of these key issues head on

194
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,439
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next few days I mean clearly</font>

195
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:10,839
while the internet and IP traffic is not

196
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,449
doubling every year we still see the

197
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,309
continued growth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP traffic growing</font>

198
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,919
at a compounded annual rate of thirty

199
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:19,899
four percent so not so shabby in a

200
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,599
pretty significant growth and I know

201
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:24,789
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to many of you last night your</font>

202
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:27,188
traffic is up thirty five percent fifty

203
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:29,229
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> 75% you're trying to think about</font>

204
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what do you do about peering</font>

205
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:33,129
extending your peering capabilities what

206
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,899
do you do about IP transit how to see

207
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,419
you support this growth of video and

208
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:40,299
then you know while I said it's not

209
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,159
doubling by 2014 there'll be a big the

210
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,349
equivalent of 32 million people

211
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,720
screaming avatar and 3d continuously

212
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,760
for the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> month so substantial</font>

213
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,900
growth and as we all know particularly

214
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,660
those that work with the wireless

215
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,680
providers or are a wireless provider you

216
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,449
know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the advent of</font>

217
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,890
machine-to-machine computing and

218
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,300
networking and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> things being</font>

219
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,970
connected so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really</font>

220
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,620
interesting times for us so I know over

221
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,270
the next couple of days you're going to

222
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">address some of these challenges so</font>

223
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:10,270
certainly you know IP ipv4 addressing

224
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,460
space running out by the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 2011 and</font>

225
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,620
what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

226
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,110
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> is clearly up as i said but</font>

227
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,650
pricing is down and what is the impact

228
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,720
on network investments and on peering

229
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,780
security attacks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a brief time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i ran</font>

230
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,580
the security practice at AT&T for about

231
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,800
four or five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and clearly we</font>

232
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,510
continue to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the threat and</font>

233
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,949
the cyber attacks continue to grow and

234
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,350
they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sophisticated as</font>

235
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,690
you know and then clearly the control of

236
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,640
traffic on broadband networks and that

237
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,730
good old age old question of network

238
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,830
neutrality which never seems to die so

239
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,720
to sum up you know we're proud of<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>
