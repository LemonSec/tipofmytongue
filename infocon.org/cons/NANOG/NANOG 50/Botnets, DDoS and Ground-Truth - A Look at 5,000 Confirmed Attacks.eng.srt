<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm up and ready not quite sure if the</font>

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,410
audience is up and ready looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> thus</font>

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,670
pretty sparse out there but glad for

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,650
those of you in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience it will be</font>

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,020
an awesome talk glad you glad you could

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,510
make it so i'll be speaking today about

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,960
botnets d dawson ground truth and

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,689
despite the title let me just pause to

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,789
just do some expectation setting much as

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,439
I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make broad sweeping statements</font>

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,960
about internet and how the Internet's

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,050
changing and about security this talk

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,540
really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a fairly small study and</font>

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,099
it really is very preliminary results so

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,019
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite going to extend the talk</font>

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,210
to make claims about security internet

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,250
wide but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">think anecdotal data that'll be going</font>

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,829
through today that we've been collecting

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the last year so first a word about</font>

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,420
ground truth you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the academic</font>

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,360
world you hear ground truth come up all

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time and papers and for academics</font>

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,289
ground truth really is a difference

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,259
between their models and their

26
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,320
simulations and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack of better word</font>

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,090
reality what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening it's</font>

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,919
where their models and their simulations

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,760
meet what's happening in real networks

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,560
real computers real environments and it

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,920
turns out ground truth is the Holy Grail

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ground truth is really really hard</font>

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,049
to obtain especially in areas like

34
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,089
security you know certainly in

35
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,640
enterprise security understanding what's

impacting enterprises what<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,960
events is hard but it gets even more

38
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,048
difficult when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talk about national</font>

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,020
communication infrastructure and

40
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,180
critical national infrastructure and you

41
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,100
know from survey data and other things

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've looked at it's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,140
that vanishingly small number of

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,110
providers actually report attacks only

45
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,360
five percent or less at report some of

46
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,450
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS or botnet attacks I've had last</font>

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,880
year well that said there's absolutely

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,189
no shortage of surveys<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco does</font>

49
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,229
surveys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Buddhist surveys or you know</font>

50
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,869
dozens and dozens of vendors and

51
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,318
analysts doing surveys on security data

52
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,879
on security trend but there really is

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,440
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little hard data very little</font>

54
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,320
quantitative data

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in fact i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think as danny and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

surveys we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often ask questions like what</font>

given carrier has experienced you know

60
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,519
the numbers commit back in all over the

61
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,670
place from hundreds of thousands to

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,810
millions to tens of millions and it's

63
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,489
quite clear when you actually go back

64
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,420
and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the carriers about</font>

65
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,390
where they're coming up with their

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,880
numbers while many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them I'm sure have</font>

67
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,380
good sources of data it's pretty clear a

68
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,170
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up as</font>

69
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,930
they go along but you know these numbers

70
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,399
are hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come by particularly when</font>

71
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,210
you get into things like botnets and

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,060
zombies and so on this also no shortage

73
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,620
of research papers we're now<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to give</font>

74
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,720
or take about a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred and</font>

six years the original data source and

92
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,809
someone when they were asked to write a

paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> they decided this is what I think</font>

94

anomalies look like this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> D das</font>

95
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,988
looks like and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got these</font>

96
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,810
entire ecosystems of papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that develop</font>

97
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,580
through the years so again very

98
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenging for academics and for</font>

99
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,260
operators to actually have ground truth

100
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,970
to know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> two attacks look like how</font>

101
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,940
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you characterize them and how are</font>

102
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,489
they evolving and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

103
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,620
challenge when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do anomaly detection</font>

104
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,470
in carrier networks or enterprise

105
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,170
networks it's always differentiating the

106
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,420
false positives from the true attacks

107
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,339
you know anomaly detection is easy

108
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,289
validating anomalies is hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> in knowing</font>

109
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> false positives or true</font>

110
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:23,340
anomalies is the really tricky bit so

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,220
this talk this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk again we're going</font>

112
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Atlas data but unlike the</font>

113
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,129
talking gave

114
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,590
time where we were focused on traffic

115
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:34,259
data this one is focused on security

116
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,138
data and in particular about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years</font>

117
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,090
ago we added the ability to manually

118
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,759
classify events within some of the arbor

119
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,919
products and over the last about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year</font>

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,900
year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half we've actually had a</font>

121
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,030
number of operators start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make use of</font>

122
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,370
the workflow and manually classify if

123
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,068
events were false positives<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attacks</font>

124
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:57,000
and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> slowly accumulating a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

125
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:59,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">set so today the talks about covering 37</font>

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,860
give or take<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs of last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty last 12</font>

127
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,169
months and we really have two different

128
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,729
overlapping data sets one is attack data

129
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,680
where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have anomalies that</font>

130
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:13,340
were tected and then manually classified

131
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,110
and then we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a smaller data set</font>

132
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,109
where we've got data on mitigations

133
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,060
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an event was detected</font>

134
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,460
either via the system or was a

135
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,770
mitigation was mainly created then we

136
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,979
track statistics associated with that

137
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,318
mitigation so we're now up to about give

138
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,479
or take five thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> events that we</font>

139
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,490
have that were either neither mitigated

140
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,860
or that were manually classified as an

141
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,690
operator as a real attack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be</font>

142
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,680
going through that data in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> remainder</font>

143
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,539
of this talk so just a quick screen

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,789
snapshot just to perhaps make it a

145
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,310
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more concrete this is actually</font>

146
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,318
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like from the workflow</font>

147
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,750

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,068
interesting from a research perspective

158
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,960
but we also of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> have commercial</font>

161
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:29,940
useful for both commercial and research

162
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:32,310
purposes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before i get into the data i</font>

163

does you do have to sort of piece many

of these together to understand when

176

you're seeing spoofed versus zombie vs

behavioral detection and then you go up

196
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,390
the stack with TCP validation things

213
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,289
of the assumptions about d das and about

214
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,750
botnets I think generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I talked</font>

215
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,760
operators there's three prevailing I

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,640
think conventional<font color="#CCCCCC"> wisdom about DDoS</font>

217
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,610
today number one is spoofing is no

218
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,800
longer common after all botnets have

219
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,750
gotten so large there's just so many

220
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,000
millions and tens of millions and

221
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,160
hundreds of millions of compromised

222
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,600
hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there that if you're actually</font>

223
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,649
launching d das you just

224
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,149
use a botnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and spoofing is passe the</font>

225
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:01,740
other claim of course is that botnets

226
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:04,649
and dia das are large that all these

227
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,519
involve thousands or tens of thousands

228
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,319
or hundreds of thousands of hosts and

229
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,290
finally that<font color="#CCCCCC"> most DDoS today is still</font>

230
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:15,329
just brute force flooding it turns out

231
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,550
as they go through the talk today that I

232
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:19,199
think two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these claims are only one</font>

233
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these claims is true and probably two</font>

234
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:24,180
are actually not true in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

235
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,860
conventional wisdom and you'll have to

236
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,810
pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the talk to actually</font>

237
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:32,399
find out which is which but I'll provide

238
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:34,800
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> hints as we go through it so quick</font>

239
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,079
overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data as I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

240
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,839
is preliminary study it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is too</font>

241
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:42,540
small to drive industry-wide conclusions

242
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,000
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is pretty varied we have</font>

243
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,610
some data sources which look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they</font>

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,220
are folks protecting their multi-billion

245
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,490
dollar web properties we have other

246
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,410
carriers who are using this to offer as

247
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,430
a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know there are t3</font>

249
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,349
demand service basis so quite a bit of

250
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data hard to make very</font>

251
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,730
generalized statements about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the overall</font>

252
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,069
internet but we do have I think a range

253
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,160
of data sources and it does include at

254
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:16,829
least attacks up to 22 gig nine million

255
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,600
packets per second in the data though

256
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,219
this is smaller than I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reports</font>

257
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,430
we've heard from carriers that have

258
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,769
experienced 50<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 or even larger so</font>

259
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,719
again fairly small sample size the tax

260
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:31,610
we're looking at but still I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

261
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,660
large enough data set to be interesting

262
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,420
quick look at just drilling down into

263
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data it turns out that the statement</font>

264
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is true is that most attacks today</font>

265
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,899
if you actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack data</font>

266
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:44,849
are actually flooding attacks fairly

267
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,579
brute force attacks trying to consume

268
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,709
the computational or bandwidth resources

269
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:52,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty percent are flooding</font>

270
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:54,268
followed by TCP level attacks which

271
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,490
generally are smaller focused on

272
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:59,069
exhausting connection state<font color="#E5E5E5"> either in</font>

273
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,560
load balancers or firewalls or on the

274
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:04,250
end system and then we've got I think

275
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">application at eight percent and policy</font>

276
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,070
is when we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got data from folks that</font>

277
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,410
are doing

278
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,140
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> application level filtering</font>

279
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,939
regular expressions geoip filtering

280

blocking all traffic except from North

281
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,350
America or Europe some of these are

282
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">running just constantly more being used</font>

283
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,300
like sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an IPS but again we've</font>

284
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,120
got you know give or take twelve fifteen

285
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,689
percent that are matching some type of

policy enforcement so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

turns out that the median is actually

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,390
quite small the median is mostly just

lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of small websites being</font>

311
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,630
in the data set which was 22 gig lasting

312
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:40,530
for days about 9 million packets per

313
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,640
second against a single / 32 and what

314
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,439
was interesting is that they chose

315
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,050
whoever this was chose to mitigate this

316
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,750

didn't just<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP source of desks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off ramp</font>

318
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,890
it but for whatever reason they had 22

319
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:57,510
gigs going for four days<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they were</font>

scrubbing or filtering the traffic so

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,480
I'll now dive into a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

335
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,260
surprised me on this slide is that I

336
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,540
really did believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd find</font>

hundreds and thousands being common in

347
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,880
involved in the other thing that becomes

348
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,770
clear as you look at the data that

349
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,410
there's some source data that clearly is

350
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:10,710
unrealistic when you get to averages of

351
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,480
four gigabits for the same source IP or

352

averaging<font color="#CCCCCC"> four are gigabits and a</font>

million<font color="#E5E5E5"> PPS for a source IP it does tend</font>

354
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,640
to suggest one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two things or maybe</font>

00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">three things it suggests that either</font>

356
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,750
they're spoofing and they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

357
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,430
really really bad job<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spoofing that</font>

358
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,760
you've got lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools just using the</font>

359
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:31,260
same IP so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great botnet and</font>

360
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same IP and you're</font>

362
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,540
you've got a large you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know mega proxy</font>

363
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,680
large NAT or something else happening

364
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,780
but you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten percent of the</font>

365
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,150
attacks just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't make sense in terms</font>

366
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:48,120
of the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic I tend to</font>

367
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:50,550
suspect this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly bad tools with</font>

368
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,800
really bad you know bad spoofing going

369
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:56,000
on and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the spoofing becomes a</font>

370
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,229
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more clear on the next slide</font>

371
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,750
you know this is traffic that's not

372
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,520
caught by the zombie layer that's not

373
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,160
caught by looking at the source traffic

374
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,420
so this isn't just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few sources this</font>

375
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,000
actually needs to be fairly well

376
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,740
distributed and on this slide we're

377
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,510
looking at the connections per second

378
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,940
the number of TCP connections attempted

379
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,490
per second going to a given victim

380
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,810
during given mitigation and then we're

381
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,340
looking at the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts that</font>

382
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,319
actually pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different sorts of</font>

383

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,940
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are legitimate hosts</font>

385
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,459
and you know it's kind of interesting

386
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,350
get two three or<font color="#CCCCCC"> four or five orders of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of connections attempted and the number</font>

389

of valid hosts

390
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,359
it does again<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 suggests fairly</font>

00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:57,850
suggest spoofing is out there with

398
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,230
relatively small number of hosts and

399
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,760
again it does get<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into you know the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">focused on the application layer and</font>

437
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,830
actually being attacked and why what are

438
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,260
the motives and what are the trends so

439
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,449
on this slide on slide 14 we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,100
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the attack data when</font>

441
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,350
we do have data<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the ports</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

445
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,800
breakdown of looking at at least from a

446
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,740
port protocol basis what's being

447

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,820
randomizing the source ports and the

452
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,110

457
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,490

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,920
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think mostly what you'd</font>

459

<font color="#E5E5E5">this slide interesting as well we're</font>

462
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,250
looking at not that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what the</font>

463
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,159
actual IP address is but we do know the

464
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:40,640
prefix length most attacks out there the

465
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:43,430
vast majority certainly for bgp where

466
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,620
the operator chooses to bgp black hole

467
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,190
either the sorcerer desk the vast

468
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,199
majority of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all four / 32 s</font>

469
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,240
and by the way once a / 32 is nailed up

470
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,060
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> often there for weeks or even in</font>

471
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,640
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases months so very large numbers</font>

472
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,399
of operators with hundreds or thousands

474
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,090
and again this is data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're seeing</font>

475
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,520
if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually choose to use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arbor</font>

map when you look at actually traffic

478
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,899
goes through the mitigation device or

479
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,930
the TMS that will actually do payload

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually based on mitigation data as</font>

490
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,360
well when you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at when an attack is</font>

491
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:50,570
mitigated how long is mitigation running

492
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,030
of the vast majority of TMS or the paler

493
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,350
based inspection it's under an hour

494
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,149
which probably reflects both the nature

495
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,030
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack as well as more granular</font>

496
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,680
control in the mitigation but if you

497
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,879
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP black hole set up for a</font>

498
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,040
customer it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely there too</font>

499
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,320
be there for hours in days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

500
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,570
weeks and again we've got some carriers

501
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,189
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to be running with hundreds or</font>

502
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,889
in one case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know thousands of these</font>

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,580
unfortunately we don't know these are

506
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,110
again source black hole or desk so it's

507
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,050
just a couple minutes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spare am on my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">last slide this talk again I wish I</font>

509
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,639
could make broad statements about how

510
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,680
attacks are changing based on real data

511
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,750
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last several years but we've</font>

512
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,540
got only a very small snapshot and only

513
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,640
37 carriers but the data we do have

514
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">suggests that spoofing is still fairly</font>

515
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,490
prevalent most attacks actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> involve</font>

516
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,840
fewer botnets than I would have expected

517
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,210
hundreds of hosts rather than tens of

518
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,250
thousands or thousands that these tend

519
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,690
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-connected hosts and that</font>

520
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,870
there's growing incidence of sort of

521
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">service application level attacks but</font>

522
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,830
the real point of this talk actually

523
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't any of the above the real talk</font>

524
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:04,110
was we've got a really interesting data

525
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,240
set with very small participation I

526
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,520
think this data to be very useful and

527
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,520
this is as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much a call for folks who</font>

aren't participating to participate in

<font color="#CCCCCC">to enable the anonymous statistics now</font>

530

questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good for a question</font>

532
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:30,870
Dave thank you did where um I'm

533
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:32,370
wondering I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if you could say</font>

534
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">something about what you think the</font>

535
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,280
sophistication you know you kind of

536
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:42,330
classified things by sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mechanism</font>

537
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,010
but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel like the attack space or</font>

538
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,840
the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source of these attacks</font>

539
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,610
is getting more sophisticated I'll just

540
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,709
give one example like you know the

541
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,560
Stuxnet thing right that thing is pretty

542
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,530
sophisticated and was probably built by

543
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,480
a you know programming<font color="#E5E5E5"> team and for you</font>

544
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,430
know specific purposes and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font>

545
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,150
if we're seeing any<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that kind of</font>

546
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff or if you can even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detect it yeah</font>

547
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,810
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a definite</font>

548
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,940
trend towards application-level attacks

549
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,370
I think it's that the industry's matured

550
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,760
you know it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you know seven</font>

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,850
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 400 megatech or</font>

554
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,419
damage now most operators have kit in

place where the arbor other vendors and

556
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:26,679
you know the bar is raised<font color="#CCCCCC"> whereas a</font>

558
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,220
challenges are where the more complex

559
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:31,630
services where we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

560
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,990
both harder to detect their lower

561
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:37,150
bandwidth and that the attackers clearly

562
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,890
have done their homework that it isn't

563
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,320
just by accident that they choose the

564
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,240
one post operation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

565
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,178
expensive that could have chosen out of

566
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,020
the tens of thousands or millions of

567
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:52,240
posts so you know this clearly it's not

568
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,850
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the under five</font>

569

00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:00,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are getting sophisticated are you</font>

571
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,100
know very<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's a long tail which</font>

is folks flooding and folks doing stuff

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing blast decade</font>

574
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,309
it's fairly easy to remediate the the

575
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,139
five percent on the far right is where

576
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:13,120
it's getting interesting I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

577
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,820
we've seen things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've only read about</font>

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,590
the you know the sum of the Stuxnet I

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,379
don't know if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen things quite</font>

580
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,000
at that level everything of<font color="#E5E5E5"> right about</font>

581
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:29,350
it sounds more impressive with each

press article I read my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Scott</font>

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:41,350
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to freely embarrass myself I'm</font>

585
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:47,470
kind of new at this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a new world</font>

586
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:50,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me I'm getting very confused on some</font>

587
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:53,380
of the terminology as I learn this and

588
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:56,200
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the methods for detection as I</font>

589
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned this and if you assume a few of</font>

590
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:05,070
you here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same boat i am</font>

591
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:05,070
do you have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommendations or</font>

592
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,230
suggested reading or good references or

593
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,600
something that maybe could be appended

594
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,600
as an appendix to your presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

595
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:26,110
introductory methods and tools for

596
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:27,370
detecting these types of tax I know how

597
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,559
to find some of them

598
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,580
but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice if you're saying</font>

599
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:36,940
gee I want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you folks give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

600
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:39,070
information about attacks perhaps there

601
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,340
needs to be a more standard methodology

602
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,460
of how to detect these attacks how to

603
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,070
classify these attacks you know kind of

604
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,220
a primer on this is the project<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

605
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,990
working on I need this information it's

606
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to the community here are some</font>

607
00:24:52,990 --> 00:25:00,070
basic ways to do this that are generally

608
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:02,500
accepted practices I know it's a stupid

609
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:06,189
dumb question but kind of needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

610
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,710
asked sure so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a number</font>

611
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of books</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

612
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,040
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreed-upon terminology and I</font>

613
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,260
think it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of involving the</font>

614
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,970
point there's an over books and it's

615
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly a number of papers attempt to</font>

616
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,980
provide a taxonomy I think what we were

617
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,690
weird what we were really asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

618
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,670
this is that one of the nice things

619
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,740
about some of our to our deployments

620
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,990
we've got still a fairly small

621
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">percentage of carriers participating as</font>

622
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:34,390
it does provide a uniform mechanism for

623
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,240
measuring like by like in providing that

624
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,920
anonymous statistics whereas you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font>

625
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,059
some of the survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> date and others where</font>

626
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,530
providers are making their own

627
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:44,830
measurements using a variety of tools

628
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:46,990
it's often<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard to combine the data</font>

629
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,928
or analyze data given that the vast

630
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,270
disparity in how it's being measured and

631
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:55,090
how it's being defined have one last

632
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,040
follow-up I've read some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> papers</font>

633
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,340
and believe me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've plowed through some</font>

634
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:05,230
of the terminology which radically

635
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:07,928
different paper to paper the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

636
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,090
is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize the you are a corporation</font>

637
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:12,760
I recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of this is based</font>

638
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:17,169
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your particular proprietary tools</font>

639
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:21,250
don't know complained about that but if

640
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:25,540
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do this what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think is</font>

641
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:27,790
a relatively valuable study have you

642
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,590
reached out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the academics have you</font>

643
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,020
reached out I know you've talked about

644
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:35,730
other vendors trying

645
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:41,010
two surveys and stuff to try to develop

646
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:43,770
a uniform method of survey for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

community at<font color="#CCCCCC"> large to collaborate on the</font>

collection of this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

649
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we've done much beyond this effort</font>

650
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,570
in the servo we do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it would be a</font>

651
00:26:52,290 --> 00:27:00,830
interesting effort if it's if it's

possible thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>
