00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks um so hi I'm a Tom Cole I'm with</font>

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:18,350
and layer I'm no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer at the phone</font>

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:18,350
company um and and nine and a half years

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,990
so pretty much what this is all about

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's experiment that's been</font>

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,570
basically going on in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> free time over</font>

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,460
n layer and somebody actually reminded

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,600
me last week when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did all the slides</font>

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,649
and I showed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and they said</font>

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing to do with</font>

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">about actually building a cheap</font>

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,059
repairing router this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,620
buying something cheap and just doing

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,718
<font color="#E5E5E5">some tricks and actually yeah that's</font>

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,280
true so for anybody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is expecting you</font>

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,840
know to get in the nitty-gritty of how

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,530
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually build a router I'm sorry</font>

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,820
if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got your hopes up so what's this</font>

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">really all about here and basically</font>

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,050
network infrastructure can be expensive

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,399
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that applies to different people</font>

22
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,050
right certain really really big

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,000
companies are perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with</font>

24
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,309
buying really<font color="#E5E5E5"> gold-plated interfaces and</font>

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,870
you know they're operating overhead is

26
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,759
really probably more their issue when it

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,250
comes to upgrading peering but for a lot

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,659
of other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> um actually the routers</font>

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,450
and the optics and everything added up

30
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,590
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> considerable internal cost and you</font>

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,119
know when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to upgrading peering</font>

32
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,700
infrastructure there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of</font>

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,810
issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come into play you know if</font>

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,159
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do for your network</font>

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,530
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know the the</font>

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">person that you want to connect to if</font>

37
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,470
there's no ports of it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,509
sorry we'd like to upgrade<font color="#E5E5E5"> we add</font>

39
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,340
another 10 gig sorry there's no ports we

40
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,799
have to add another router but we can't

41
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,299
get any more space there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> power and</font>

42
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,189
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports themselves have a cost</font>

43
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,079
associated and you know depending on how

44
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,220
you operate things you know you look at

45
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,779
a pairing port oh well it's not

46
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">revenue-generating it's not a custom</font>

47
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,659
report that that's another issue too and

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,340
the other part to that comes into this

49
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,470
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gigabit Ethernet is</font>

50
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,689
basically pretty much the standard

51
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,149
lately for any kind of inter connection

52
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,610
between networks it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you still</font>

53
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,290
don't find a lot of envy Giggy bundled

54
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,860
up it's generally at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

55
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,420
are doing 10 gig and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by 10 gig and you</font>

57
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,079
networks have basically decided to move

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,378
away from big traditional sonnet type

that are really you know Ethernet

ethernet and but you know pairing

64
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,780
routers still are a significant you know

65
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,430
expense within their infrastructure and

66
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,390
you know the boxes that are currently

67
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,560
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and a lot of people's networks</font>

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,569
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just waiting for the Newark cards</font>

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,730
whenever they get from you know

74
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:39,049
certified and they work with new code so

75
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,369
that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of problems like you</font>

know come and play when you have to

77
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,780
upgrade stuff so vendors have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

96
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,930
you know fairly reasonable it compared

97
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,220
to what they used to be but at the same

98

typically find on a service provider

you to you it's meant to go top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rack</font>

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:20,180
you know they're built on using sfp+ and

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,380
you know it's cheaper optics so it works

121
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,460
pretty well

122
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,229
you know so some of these boxes you

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,388
could you know say well the ASR 9k it's

playing around here well you know could

130

<font color="#CCCCCC">you actually take some of these trooper</font>

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,280

143
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,229
you can actually install you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> key OS</font>

144
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,869
if that's something you need well

145
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,520
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some limitations there you</font>

146
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,160
know decent software well you know you

147
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,198
were all used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a good CLI as</font>

pipe commands things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,460
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get all that</font>

150
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,050
packet filters you still have to protect

151
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">your border of your network and some of</font>

152
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,320
them have<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited functionality there</font>

153
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,669
and in just in general like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

154
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,949
forwarding features themselves you know

156
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,479
starting out with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ipv4 support</font>

157
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,550
although that is obviously changing and

158
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,680
all these features you know there's

159
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,620
somewhat difficult for some of these

160
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">smaller boxes to actually implement so</font>

161
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,650
going off the first one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fib</font>

162
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,440
constraint one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty obvious</font>

163
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,969
one you know you're putting this box in

164
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,590
the pairing roll it needs to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font>

165
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,970
of routes on it lots of paths you can't

166
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,099
obviously install to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit because the</font>

167
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">box can't handle it so one idea here is</font>

168
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,190
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's separate the rib versus the</font>

169
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">fib so the rib holds all your routing</font>

170
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,320
protocol information so your bgp routes

171
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,820
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp routes and the fit way is what</font>

172
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually gets put in the forwarding</font>

173
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,840
plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what's used for forwarding</font>

174
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,070
packets now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do here you</font>

175
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
need to have a definitely large rib

176
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,469
because you're going to be pairing

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,970
you're going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially multiple</font>

178
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,830
copies<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet table all your</font>

179
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,500
peer routes so you're the rib needs to

180
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,210
be fairly large but since the rib is

181
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,099
basically stored in memory you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ram</font>

182
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,320
is cheap and a lot of the one you two

00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,669
boxes are shipping you know do come with

184
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,070
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one gig of memory so it's not</font>

187
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,700

and play with every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature in</font>

198
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,140
the network um you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

199
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,610
networks that are just pushing internet

200
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,430
bits you know it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> common to find</font>

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> qos just isn't configured anywhere</font>

202
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,370
now if you look a lot of traditional you

203

<font color="#CCCCCC">know large telco style and networks</font>

where they are transporting layer to VPN

<font color="#CCCCCC">Network and for them qos is probably</font>

209
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,360
important and because it everything's on

210
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
one network they have to guarantee that

211

<font color="#E5E5E5">level service for those customers paying</font>

requirement you know maybe lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of qos</font>

216
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:35,490
isn't really a showstopper the other

217
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,600
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is lack of forwarding features you</font>

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of driving things to go beyond just</font>

road map right but it looks there's

237
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,940
still significant demand and it's you

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,180
know it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be coming out fairly</font>

239
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,770
soon um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other problem is you know</font>

240
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,000
you do need to have packet filters right

241
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,229
you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet you have a router</font>

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,670
there you have lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of routers</font>

243
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,140
internally you need to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

244
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,640
infrastructure so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty reasonable</font>

245
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,310
to say you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have be able to put</font>

246
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,510
some sort of X amount of line ACL to at

247
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,710
least stop packets coming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

towards your lupex it's a pretty

250
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,720
reasonable request at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you</font>

251
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,370
still have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your customers</font>

the packet police and telling that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

254
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,380
know some IRC servers getting attacked

255
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,270
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to filter it for them so</font>

256
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,200
you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the one-off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ACLs you</font>

257
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,640
may have to apply

258
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,930
um you know at best you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

259
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,600
get you know on some of these smaller

IP options or IP options type you're

267
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,360
probably not going to see that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,290
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get around you know just relying on</font>

packet filters to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,800
the other part is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually decent</font>

275
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,780

really all that great um you know and

278
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,600
that's mainly because the people you

pretty simple it's basically turn up and

294
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,000
down ports maybe you'll get SNMP you

295
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,620
know but it's very limited functionality

296
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,910
and in general when they do try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,850
it's a first grade level you know you

you have show you have config maybe a

actually write the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software but it's</font>

314
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,860
know feature parity with other devices

316
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,130
into this too much but you know there's

317
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,109
another thing going on which open flow

318
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,880
and there's a whole other series of

319
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,920
talks at this nano covering open flow

320
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,740
which

321
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,719
I'm it<font color="#E5E5E5"> best to defer to you know what</font>

322
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,649
they're talking about and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what</font>

323
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that space is</font>

324
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,209
pretty interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm sure we'll</font>

325
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,399
hear a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and I'm but it's I</font>

326
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,599
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be open a lot of doors in</font>

327
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,470
terms of what you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some of the</font>

328
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,850
cheaper boxes out there so what's unique

329
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,110
about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what are we</font>

330
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,519
getting and you know using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this chief</font>

331
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,410
box that's going to do routing you know

332
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,180
how does this even go to work you know

333
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,069
if you got a limited fib and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

334
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,829
this comes up with basically kind of

335
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,510
exploiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgb unicast label and at a</font>

previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> natalie was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> austin we talked</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know doing some kind of</font>

338
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,209
routing tricks with building<font color="#CCCCCC"> and low</font>

339
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">speeds to external interfaces and you</font>

340
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,119
know we kind of highlighted<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgb unicast</font>

341
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,610
label and you could use the same

342
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,010
application here and basically beat

343
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,579
reunion casa a label is another bgp

344
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,889
address family so you have ipv4 unicast

345
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,479
ipv6 unicast there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of other</font>

346
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,740
ones but unicast label is an interesting

347
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,930
one where it's basically you can

348
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">advertise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a prefix and associate an MPLS</font>

349
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,638
label with it over bgp and it's kind of

350
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,899
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp and RSVP allocate</font>

351
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,790
labels except you know they build the

352
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,110
LSP end and in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can just</font>

353
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,640
basically say here's a prefix here's a

354
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,920
label and that router makes a local

355
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">allocation within it saying for this</font>

356
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,719
prefix here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> label that you'd use</font>

357
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,850
when you forward any traffic to it so

358
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,019
let's try a little experiment let's say

359
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,970
if we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these one</font>

360
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,190
you to type boxes so we'll say the you

361
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,459
know juniper I x 4500 it's like line ray

362
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,040
40 x 10 gige to you eight to 12 k fib

363
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one gig of memory and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

364
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,339
is like let's take this box will hang it

365
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,589
off something smart some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of core</font>

366
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,910
router and for our purposes will say

367
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:21,269
that core router probably has a full

368
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,160
table on it and you know we're just

369
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use this little cheap box and</font>

370
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,860
we're going to basically either<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw</font>

371
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,540
off customers or throw pairs on to it

372
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you know it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs a top</font>

373
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp to and you get debate on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font>

374
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,970
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hang up something smart</font>

375
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,079
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not and a lot of the reasons why</font>

376
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,610
you'd probably want to hang it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

377
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,620
something that has a full-size fib is

378
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,899
because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to route</font>

379
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">two things back internally there's ways</font>

380
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,600
you can kind of get around that by

381
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,269
encapsulating traffic and sang it to

382
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,620
another router but for the purpose of

383
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:50,040
this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hang it off something</font>

384
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,480
that's smart the other part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font>

385
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,560
different want this cheap box whatever

386
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,390
it is going to be it needs to establish

387
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">igp adjacencies so it needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font>

388
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,620
active member it needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

389
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,780
learn how

390
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,280
occurs to loot backs and that's

391
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,120
important for a few reasons first of all

392
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,680
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to bring up each of you</font>

393
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,030
sessions or something internally you

394
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably want to do that across your</font>

395
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,439
loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> backs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually what the</font>

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,580
actual point-to-point interfaces the

397
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,930
other part is you know you're going to

398
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,340
be advertising routes external inning

399

push it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Med when you advertise</font>

404
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,910

407
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,180

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,730
pretty you know skinny with regards to

418
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,510
you know just point2 points<font color="#E5E5E5"> and loop</font>

419
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,640
bags and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really customer routes the</font>

420
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,870
other part is that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> split the</font>

421
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,010
rib from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fib so we kind of</font>

422
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,270
highlighted that you need to separate

423
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,910
the two because<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's going to be way</font>

424
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,470
bigger than the other in juniper luckily

425
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,540
there's one way easy way to do this I

426
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,070
think XR has a similar way you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

427
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,270
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the whole idea is that you</font>

428
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,250
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically turn everything that</font>

429
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,439
you learn in from PGP and push that into

430
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,480
the rib of the router and not directly

431
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,370
into the fib and in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

432
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,260
well what goes in which one well

433
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,390
obviously what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be qualified</font>

434
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,340
for going in the fib should be directly

435
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,870
connected interfaces I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

436
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,470
connected you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be able to afford</font>

437
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to it the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp routes and you can say</font>

438
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,400
well internal networks things like that

439
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,570
and then a default route really so if

440
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,680
you have traffic coming inbound where

441
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,480
you going to send that traffic and

442
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,010
there's a few different thoughts on what

443
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,720
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do here the problem obviously</font>

444
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,430
with a default route on a you know

445
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,480
external facing router particular if

446
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,890
you're you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're doing settlement</font>

447
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">preparing is somebody could simply just</font>

448
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,910
you know static route something to you

449
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,530
and you'll carry it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the traffic so</font>

450
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,969
it depends on you know do you trust your

451
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,199
peers and a variety of other things but

452
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really at the discretion of the</font>

453
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,720
operator and so you know in junos for

454
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,920
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can write a simple policy to</font>

455
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,750
say what actually gets installed in the

456
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">FIB and you can if it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgb routes you</font>

457
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,580
can match on community so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a pretty</font>

458
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice granular ability to to have the</font>

459
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,640
other part is you need it obviously

460
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,229
establish<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibgp connectivity within your</font>

461
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,370
internal network you need to learn

462
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,500
routes and as

463
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,230
it needs go both ways from Paris back

464
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,760
inside your own network there's one

465
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that you can actually turn on in</font>

466
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,750
junos today which is bgp add<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths which</font>

467
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,579
is actually a pretty cool feature so you

468
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,170
know you can learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same prefix for</font>

469
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,540
multiple external pairs and you can

470
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise each valid a path back inside</font>

471
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,829
your network traditionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> PGP wood is</font>

472
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,300
only going to select one and send it

473
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,680
back now you can open the doors and

474
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,630
really give that kind of granular

475
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,760
routing control and giving other routers

476
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,980
in your network a good view so add path

477
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,779
is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool you know it</font>

478
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,460
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> such thing as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> free lunch so</font>

479
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,990
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously have a higher</font>

480
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,440
memory footprint because you're learning

481
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,450
that X amount of times in BGP so you

482
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,980
know you have have controls around that

483
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,500
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think right now with in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Juneau so</font>

484
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,480
you actually can put a policy in front

485
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,200
of it to say what routes are actually

486
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,880
qualified to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to add paths so you</font>

487
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,440
can actually declare which prefixes you

488
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,290
want in which previously can go on it

489
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,000
advertise<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad pass for and you know how</font>

490
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">many an amount of past you want to</font>

491
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">install and kind of getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into what</font>

492
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,089
this is all about is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> next top</font>

493
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,110
tricks because the whole idea is you

494
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:12,940
know we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for nothing</font>

495
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're not filling up the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FIB on</font>

496
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,670
these tiny little boxes what are we

497
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,829
doing modes back to the BGP unicast

498
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,140
label<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case we're using mpls</font>

499
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,690
with a unicast label to make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

500
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,490
and to make this happen you basically

501
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,510
need to take all your pairing interfaces

502
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,940
and you need to advertise their

503
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,350
point-to-point into ibgp with unicast

504
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,370
label so basically you have a pairing

505
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,170
router you want to get the

506
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,730
point-to-point interfaces so they have

507
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,160
MPLS label associated with each

508
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,750
individual pair so you have puree over

509
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,579
here well then there's one MPLS label

510
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,080
going to that particular router another

511
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,370
pair there's another unique label and

512
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do that it's kind of</font>

513
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,040
interesting you know you can think<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

514
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">well I'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read just reconnected in</font>

515
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,089
BGP but it doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way it all</font>

516
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,589
it does is it advertises a implicit no

517
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,420
label which doesn't help you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

518
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">just tells the router to pop it and then</font>

519
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,689
it gets processed for an IP lookup so

520
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,010
that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you which I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

521
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,370
have to do and I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing around</font>

522
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,830
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it worked which is that you</font>

523
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,050
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to advertise and unique 32 of the</font>

524
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,880
remote end of let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asajj 30 into</font>

525
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,198
bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

526
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean you can reach us we connected</font>

527
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,170
that's not doing it well if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce</font>

528
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,939
your aesthetic how would you do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

529
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,949
actually if you static route the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers</font>

530
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:17,260
remote and with the next hop of itself

531
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:19,480
it's on IP address that apparently does

532
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,079
the trick<font color="#E5E5E5"> and an it'll advertising label</font>

533
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,459
for each and

534
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,799
your destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> address the other part</font>

535
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,059
here is with next hop tricks if you're

536
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,889
advertising a list internally and you're

537
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,269
learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> rouse from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pairs you want to</font>

538
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,039
advertise the true next top which is

539
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:34,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from the pier interface</font>

540
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,190
you don't want to rewrite next top self

541
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,510
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just tells packets to go to</font>

542
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,460
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> router and then it gets looked up</font>

543
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">for IP you know processing at that point</font>

544
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,059
you want to advertise the true remote

545
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:45,940
end which is the actual pair between

546
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,649
neighbor address and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this you</font>

547
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,029
basically bypass IP lookup on the

548
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,350
pairing router so you don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

549
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:52,179
all those routes in the fit because it's

550
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,809
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in on a label and then</font>

551
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know IP datagram now</font>

552
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:59,559
here's some graphical examples of what

553
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,700
it all kind of looks like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> case you</font>

554
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">know here's our little cheap pairing</font>

555
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,230
router it's got different links

556
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,080
individual 30 ones because 30 ones are

557
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,570
cool and you have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> colors here</font>

558
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,610
and in the rib you have let's say each

560
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,658
24 and then in our fib we have labels

561
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:18,690
that are allocated which just happen to

562
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:22,450
match up with a SMS that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work for and</font>

563
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,370
the individual such 30 ones as well so

564
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,230
your router locally knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh anything</font>

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,689
that comes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> labeled 7132 goes out you</font>

569
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,260
known within the fit because it directly

570
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:39,639
connected and then what happens is we

571
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">take those routes that you have that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're learning through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP and you</font>

573
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,019
advertise it you know let's say we're

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,029
out reflector infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

575
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,590
advertise you know the ipv4 unicast

576
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:49,240
address family in this case so the

577
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet route itself and then you</font>

578
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,659
advertise the<font color="#CCCCCC"> union cast label which is</font>

579
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:55,269
basically the corresponds to the prefix

580
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:57,039
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> label associated with that pair</font>

581
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,809
and then somewhere farther down in your

582
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,879
network on a router that can have a full

583
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:03,549
fit it's basically looking in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIB</font>

584
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">and says oh for this watch 24 I see you</font>

585
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:07,960
know via<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad pass three paths to get</font>

587
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,600
these routes that I see in you know to

588
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,870
go through the actual interfaces so for

589
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,299
10<font color="#E5E5E5"> out 10 knots 00 such 24 the next hop</font>

590
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,330
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 outs or not one not one which</font>

591
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:24,279
corresponds to label some be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 132 so what</font>

592
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,418
that kind of looks like is basically you

593
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:26,830
know here's your router somewhere deep

594
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,510
in your network that wants to push

595
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,699
traffic out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it's going</font>

596
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,929
to send an MPLS outer label which will

597
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,120
carry you all the way to your you know

598
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:34,920
cheap peering router

599
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,600
it pops it gets the inter label and the

600
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter label basically strips off the</font>

601
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,050
label<font color="#CCCCCC"> then strip Ford's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Datagram out</font>

602
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,639
so you basically eliminated the need to

603
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,700
have the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> big routing table on</font>

604
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that little cheap box you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know so what</font>

605
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,309
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that look like if you look on the</font>

606
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,840
actual peering router itself you

607
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,670
basically have this corresponding you

608
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,320
know this label over here it goes this

609
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,720
interface this label over here goes to

610
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,129
another interface it's fairly simple in

611
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,500
terms of what actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes into the FIB</font>

612
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,430
and you know if you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trace her out</font>

613
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,900
you see the you know they'll go through

614
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">different paths in the network and you</font>

615
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,559
can't just the labels<font color="#CCCCCC"> tack as it goes</font>

616
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,550
through this so has the outer label<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

617
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network to you're</font>

618
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,220
peering router and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has a local</font>

619
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">label that actually punts it out to</font>

620
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,400
whichever individual peering interface

621
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,870
you want so that's great and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

622
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this really limited fit router and</font>

623
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,479
it's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this outbound traffic but</font>

624
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,270
you still have traffic coming into your

625
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,320
network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so that what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

626
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,639
about this and this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on</font>

627
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kind of network you are how many</font>

628
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,550
prefixes you have internally so if your

629
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,750
internal routes of whatever you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

630
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,520
route internally within your network is

631
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,080
larger than your fib that's where you

632
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,830
kind of have to cheat and by cheating I

633
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,120
mean you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to point</font>

634
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,500
default to basically tell your router

635
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,699
that hey for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the same on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic you</font>

636
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to go to something as a full table</font>

637
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,270
because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have it so let's</font>

638
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,740
say if you just plug this in a model

639
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,389
where you have your cheap hearing router

640
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,730
hanging off a core box<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a you</font>

641
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,520
know not unconstrained fib you could

642
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">just punt that traffic up or there's</font>

643
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,040
some other tricks you can do you just

644
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,600
basically say oh that default route

645
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,280
routed this other router that maybe

646
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,169
Jason or somewhere nearby that does have

647
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,790
a full table and it really depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

648
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">your network and you know do what can</font>

649
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you afford to have that traffic possibly</font>

650
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,770
loop through you know another router in

651
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,820
your network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know depending on some</font>

652
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,800
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

653
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,960
ratios are different if you're heavy

654
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,280
outbound maybe this is a big problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

655
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,330
have some that inbound traffic loop down

656
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,670
through another router just to go

657
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that look up but if your</font>

658
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,790
internal routes are few you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much prefixes inside you</font>

660
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,790
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably just throw that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the FIB</font>

661
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,170
if you have enough room and once again

662
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem with doing that default is</font>

663
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,470
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really at risk for someone</font>

664
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,330
in pointing static routes at you over an

665
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,620
exchange and for other prefixes and if

666
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,919
you're not watching obviously somebody

667
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,270
could abuse that um so back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

668
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">this whole experiment and you know it</font>

669
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds really great does it really work</font>

670
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,570
well let's look at one juniper running

671
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,550
router here it appears<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work I mean</font>

672
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,689
show route table mpls shows that it's

673
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,720
popping out through the individual

674
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,370
interfaces unfortunately it doesn't on

675
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,050
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular example that we were</font>

using the x 4500

677
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,950
seems to have all the mechanics to do

678
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,360
mpls but it's not actually as you can

679
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">see on the Marvel chip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's refusing to</font>

684
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,990
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this really all about well</font>

685
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,820
basically you're almost there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

686
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,740
of technology wise and what you can buy

platforms although they're a bit more

700
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,050
pricier MX 240 it works on some cisco

701
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,340
box as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the whole</font>

702
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,590
point of this is you know doing this on

703
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cheap so really what's available</font>

704
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:45,659
there um basically there's hope um you

705
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,130
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> in particular on the ax models</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

706
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,320
believe they do have mpls coming at some

707
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,180
point in time there's other platforms

708
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,679
you know bro<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcom and things like</font>

709
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,240
that which I believe are probably at

710
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,530
some point in the near future at some

711
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,190
point they've they've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

712
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,510
have mpls support to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I would</font>

713
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine it's really just a matter of</font>

714
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,340
time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't initially expect any</font>

715
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,320
kind of great software implementations

716
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,689
of mpls so you know expecting the full

717
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,909
RSVP<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp stack is probably asking for</font>

718
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,110
quite a bit you know if they'd had that

719
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,510
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could probably take the same</font>

720
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,250
box and make it you know a simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> lsr</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

721
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,920
your network and make it a core box you

722
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,480
know devoid of any kind of routing table

723
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,160
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to rely upon some really</font>

724
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,290
minimal implementation to mpls where you

725
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,710
may have to write static or nailed up

726
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,120
LSPs you know routing protocol

727
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,560
functionality on these boxes are

728
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,989
completely there yet you know they may

729
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,240
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> be shipping with ospf and you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">beach be and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Isis is just not there um</font>

731
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,230
in this case use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of juniper</font>

732
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">ax because it does have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font>

routing capability of<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos right there</font>

734
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,290
running on some of the commodity

735
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,240
platform so it it's there we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

736
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,490
example it mostly works except for the

737
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,870
whole mpls / and then there's still kind

738
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,000
of a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all this merchant</font>

739
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,469
silicon can't even do mpls and some of

740
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,080
the things we're asking I mean push pops

741
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,780
and swaps can it even do that it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

742
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,879
performance

743
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,800
be really bad it's certainly

744
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,210
questionable when I think we start to

745
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,690
see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to come stuff come out</font>

746
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,280
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next year or so so that that's</font>

747
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:16,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I want if</font>

748
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:18,670
there's any questions other any

749
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,410
questions the mics are open I've got a

750
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:23,830
question that somebody sent me over over

751
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:26,350
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am that's from negative works of the</font>

752
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:29,080
i-x talking about a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the smaller</font>

753
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:32,530
boxes they've got quite quite shallow

754
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,730
buffers and how you any thoughts or

755
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,050
insight and how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font>

756
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,120
behave in situations where you've got

757
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,830
like pretty hot links no shallow buffers

758
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,209
that that's that's definitely an issue I

759
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,860
don't you see a lot of these boxes they

760
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,240
do have small buffers and and that

761
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,850
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very conducive I think</font>

762
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,370
in in certainly certain internet

763
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,870
environments and I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing</font>

764
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,209
you could do there is really you either

765
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:56,649
operate in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> manner and deal with the</font>

766
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:58,300
performance as it is or<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully they</font>

767
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,890
add additional buffers at that time but

768
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that can certainly be a showstopper</font>

769
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:08,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Julie egli um so thanks for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this work</font>

770
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:13,750
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> kicking this idea around with</font>

771
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:15,520
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ax series boxes for a while and I'm</font>

772
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,350
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of eagerly awaiting feature</font>

773
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,879
enhancement that's supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

774
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:25,929
with for those but I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

775
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,240
really useful work and it points so<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

776
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:31,060
towards using boxes that don't actually

777
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:37,240
cost like 15 or 20 thousand dollars per

778
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:40,389
port yeah to do this and in the context

779
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,640
of buffers I mean one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

780
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,640
problems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see with the buffers in</font>

781
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,560
these platforms is draining stuff from 1

782
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,610
10 gig port through a bunch of one gig

783
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:53,649
ports and when the edges like mostly

784
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:58,030
congruent that seems to actually work a

785
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:59,590
lot better thanks yeah and I'm really

786
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

787
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,799
you know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's probably in the</font>

788
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,899
next year coming out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see a lot</font>

789
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,010
more mpls features coming in the data

790
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
center i think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive a lot</font>

791
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,960
of these cheaper boxes to support it and

792
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,490
it's that's really the missing piece you

793
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,169
know once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the round the software</font>

794
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,700
isn't all that great on top of it but

795
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:17,470
once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it all together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font>

796
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:25,809
opens the doors to do a lot of cool

797
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:27,840
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question is thanks very</font>

798
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:27,840
much
