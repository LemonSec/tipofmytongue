had in attendance of those 505 paid and

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,430
the rest waved over for being speakers

195
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:12,649
or sponsors and so forth a third of the

196
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,329
attendees were newcomers that's been a

197
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:17,600
bit of a norm for a few meetings here

198
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:22,870
now nine students attended 26 countries

199
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,250
represented and 31 US states plus DC

200
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,310
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the financial</font>

201
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:32,540
results briefly there was revenue of 409

202
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:35,388
thousand expenses of 423 for a balance

203
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,099
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative fourteen thousand so a</font>

204
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:39,410
perfectly reasonable question at this

205
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,589
point would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so how do you put on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

206
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,439
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has record attendance and</font>

207
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:47,060
full sponsor participation and still end

208
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,410
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a negative number so let me</font>

209
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,810
provide a couple of the details on that

210
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,339
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all San Francisco</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is about is</font>

211
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,479
expensive a place you can put on a

00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting in the u.s. in the hosting</font>

213
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,439
dollars in relative terms were about

214
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:08,060
80,000 70,000 more than a couple

215
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:10,910
previous meetings on a per person basis

216
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,920
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty four percent more cost per</font>

217
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,100
person in San Francisco than the last

218
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,410
couple meetings now that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't regard</font>

219
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,939
is the hugest factor because of course

220
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we knew that was going to be the case</font>

221
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:24,860
San<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francisco is just expensive and we</font>

222
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,620
build into the pricing and costs of

223
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,779
nanog allowance for that factor so we

224
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:34,699
can put on meetings in in Tier one

225
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:36,680
cities as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as others but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it did it</font>

226
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:40,399
did do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to absorb the cushion that</font>

227
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">we build in so also in the first portion</font>

228
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year we had two fairly</font>

229
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:47,000
significant staff transitions and the

230
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,040
merit staff who work on nanog

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,200
the way we do budgeting and financing it

232
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,329
merit in terms of nanog is that any

233
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,600
identifiable costs that are attributed

234
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,150
to nanog are indeed put against the the

235
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,910
revenues from a meeting so as the timing

236
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:04,490
of those two changes went up against the

237
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,560
San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting the cost of those</font>

238
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,930
were about<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty thousand dollars and so</font>

239
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,790
the you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would have swung</font>

240
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,160
the the balance if we were in steady

241
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:18,130
state between the red we ended up with

242
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,130
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty solid financial outcome</font>

243
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,910
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention two meetings upcoming and</font>

244
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,589
there's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a third dimension but</font>

245
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,319
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the date offhand so we</font>

246
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,900
will we will figure that out nano 51 is

247
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,400
in Miami in January<font color="#E5E5E5"> and februari a great</font>

248
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:37,790
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in Miami hosted by Terremark</font>

249
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">952 then jun 12 through 15 in denver</font>

250
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:47,900

251
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:51,460
will be in philadelphia in october two

252
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:55,000
thousand eleven excellent okay I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

253
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,000
any questions

254
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,210
all right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the first</font>

255
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,709
major topic now we're on to the election

256
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,540
so I first look over the process then

257
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,000
we'll hear from the steering<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee</font>

258
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,569
candidates and then we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,390
charter amendment and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new nog bylaws</font>

260
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:21,160
so the election<font color="#CCCCCC"> process every year at</font>

261
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last meeting of the year</font>

262
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,420
we have an election everybody who's been

263
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a meeting in the last two years I</font>

264
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:31,060
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is as eligible to vote it's</font>

265
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,520

266
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,920
be instructions if you should already be

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,060
the voting closes the computers will

272
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,970
chug away and and produce the results

273
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,099
and the results will be announced around

274
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,930
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the meeting on Wednesday so</font>

275
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,340

276
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,339
you'll get to hear Goodwin who won

277
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,980
before I move on are there any questions

278
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,710
about the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself or we all clear</font>

279
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,560
we've done it enough times please if you

385
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,840
pretty simple I helped start what became

386
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,939
new knob and I feel that I need to see

387
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,919
it through thing is there are three

388

400
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,610
steering committee if you think that we

401
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,990
need to change or if you think that

402
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,490
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right thing then</font>

403
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,620
it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send the signal and vote me</font>

404

thanks

407
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I forgot to put this in the slides but</font>

408
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,139
it is definitely worth pointing out here

409
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,880
that the people who are elected to the

410
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">steering committee will become also</font>

411
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:29,020
board members for new nog are replacing

412
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,909
those who are not elected here so they

413
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,580
dentists<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep them congruent</font>

414
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:37,300
throughout the life of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> current nano</font>

415
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:42,250
organization so it's kind of a double

416
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,510
election two for one all right well

417
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,000
there is one charter amendment on the

418
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:52,000
ballot this is the text in its entirety

419
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,910

421
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:00,430
nog<font color="#CCCCCC"> windup working on nanog it is an</font>

422
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,580
endorsement for the new knob

423
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:05,230
organization and expresses a desire of

424
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,179
the community that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage an orderly</font>

425
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,760
transition and transfer of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant</font>

426
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,170
and special property so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

452
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,500
one question which is shall we adopt the

453
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,290
bylaws that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> produced by steve</font>

gilbert<font color="#E5E5E5"> in his committee over</font>

456
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,990
vote YES on it those draft bylaws are

457
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,350
adopted and become the corporate bylaws

458
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:35,300
if you vote no and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the election loses</font>

459

464
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,860
worth pointing out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the bylaws do</font>

465
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:56,990
allow for amendments so that any

mistakes that are made in either case

467
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:03,260

some had discussions and a couple of

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,379
conference calls to hammer out what the

member<font color="#E5E5E5"> said structure is to fold into</font>

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:27,120
bylaws the this is just a basic overview

633
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,800
of there was a survey taken of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

634
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:35,280
various member models used in different

635
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:42,030
organizations the feedback expected now

636
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:44,250
is expected to drive any rat rat ified

637
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:49,070
changes that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary going</font>

638
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:54,240
forward if there if there is any and

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:56,970
they currently are part of the part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

640
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:02,550
the existing bylaws that we are being

00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:12,140
we're discussing in a few minutes there

642
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:12,139
was a well sorry I hadn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> read these</font>

643
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:22,380
basically positioning ourselves for for

644
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:23,879
moving forward it's I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if this</font>

645
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,070
is that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current tech I'm</font>

646
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,070
getting a strange feeling this was not

647
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:41,420
well that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct one that was</font>

Louis thank you

649
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:49,669
the there was discussion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd future's</font>

650
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:53,700
recently about the about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the types of</font>

651
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:55,559
memberships and you know that's I'm

652
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,909
expecting somebody to come up and

653
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:05,279
actually say something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that right</font>

654
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:08,970
now but I'm surprised there isn't can I

655
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">have her son yes one technical</font>

member hi Steve<font color="#CCCCCC"> jaybird governance</font>

658
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:21,690
working group the I noticed here we have

659
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:24,840
the life member listed as ten times the

660
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,759
annual membership views and I believe

661
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,668
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> removed and left at the</font>

662
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:32,489
discretion of the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a that</font>

663
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:35,849
was an update<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes but that hard number</font>

664
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:37,679
doesn't exist next look Julie<font color="#E5E5E5"> egli um</font>

665
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:40,470
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who come</font>

666
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,379
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comment on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I'll do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

667
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,509
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I guess I failed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a rise</font>

668
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:47,759
out of anybody on 92 with my comment

669
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:49,739
about that so we had to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> around in</font>

670
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,669
another cycle before that happened

671
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:55,590
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know I not sure that i</font>

672
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:58,109
actually will vote against the the

673
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,269
bylaws as they as they stand today so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

674
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:02,369
wouldn't say that I'm wildly opposed to

675
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:07,169
it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know would have preferred</font>

676
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:09,509
different language that said I guess

677
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:12,059
that's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say on it</font>

678
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:15,720
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other bearded person</font>

679
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:19,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in Atlanta for this so yeah</font>

680
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">doubt he will be communicating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any more</font>

681
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,789
directly than he already has understood

682
00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:26,489
and I do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that that's fully</font>

683
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:28,739
expected that a whole process is to be

684
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:30,869
iterative<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there will be stumbles</font>

685
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:34,200
that's what happened when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did the</font>

686
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:36,090
Nano charter in 2005 it took many many

687
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,440
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we all</font>

688
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,470
thought was pretty functional and that

689
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,620
made for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good platform on which to</font>

690
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">start this process Kevin</font>

691
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:49,149
oh sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> pedicle right I think one of the</font>

692
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,179
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were quite successful</font>

693
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:57,130
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the last charter and you know</font>

694
00:33:52,180 --> 00:34:00,910
actually avoided in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in subsequent</font>

695
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:03,700
revisions doing was being extremely

696
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:07,080
specific that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we left things at the</font>

697
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:10,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">descrip apart apart from the ability to</font>

contain in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> steering committee we</font>

701

left a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things up to the</font>

description<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the discretion of the</font>

703
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,179
various organizations that were

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:31,570
responsible for them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

705
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:34,720
a useful model going forward that is for

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,590
reality is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana was founded in the idea</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who had an interest hey their</font>

money and came to nanog thus they were

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,610
members and that is still true as of

732
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:48,549
today I your first statement up there

733
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:51,490
talks about demonstrated professional

competence in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New nog designated fields</font>

735
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,970
of interest aside from the fact that

736
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,460
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is enough weasel words in there to</font>

737
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:59,569
make a

grin<font color="#CCCCCC"> and smile happily I am utterly</font>

739
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:05,690
baffled at the need for this particular

740
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:07,370
designation I suppose maybes keep the

741

lawyers out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which case maybe I'm</font>

forest unfortunately I'm afraid a lot of

743
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,970
lawyers know enough about networking to

744
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:17,990
sound vaguely confident couldn't fool

745
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:21,049
their way in generally though I really

746
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefer to see membership as open as</font>

747
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:27,260
possible and if you're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font>

748
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:31,220
your money to come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog meetings I</font>

749
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,950
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see the additional</font>

750
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,899
overhead so to speak of becoming an

751
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,850
anode member whether that's required for

752
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,440
meeting membership and I realize it's

753
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:41,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">not but it's required for voting in</font>

754
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,120
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that should remain as</font>

755
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,879
open as possible I like the open

756
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,520
structure since last revolution not the

757
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,530
current revolution and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

758
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing continue I've been</font>

759
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">very quiet about this to this point</font>

760
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,060
since I am about to retire I will

761
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,970
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it a couple more nanos</font>

762
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,790
before I head out the door but Betty

763
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,740
twisted my arm last night and so that

764
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,779
said hey you care about now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font>

765
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">again if you do get up and say something</font>

766
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,630
so that's that's what I'm saying

767
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,870
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and probably talk too long</font>

768
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:18,260
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> no but valid points kevin and i</font>

769
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:20,000
think the yeah definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think to</font>

770
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,220
your openness point part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the idea of</font>

771
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a a paid membership that is</font>

772
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:29,080
decoupled from required attendance is

773
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:32,690
actually reach out to more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

constituents<font color="#CCCCCC"> though whatever 10,000 plus</font>

775

00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:39,950
other folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are currently not as</font>

777
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,689
active because they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

778
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:47,689
travel damn gang Goulding I was not part

779
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,580
of the membership working group but is

780
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:52,940
understanding a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> points one was I</font>

781
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:54,620
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wii's awards were so that</font>

782
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:58,900
anyone who wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay the money could</font>

783
00:37:54,620 --> 00:38:01,009
qualify you know when you become a

784
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,600
non-profit you have to have some

785
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,960
definition of membership and there's a

786
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,640
couple ways of doing it

787
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,770
but having<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that sounds really</font>

788
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,470
good like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weaselly enough so</font>

789
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:14,009
that anyone here wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join or anyone</font>

790
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,689
else who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> join can join is sort</font>

791
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,940
of the idea about having a really open

792
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,859
membership the only other way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

793
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,839
this something that says anyone who's

794
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:24,779
really interested in topic area<font color="#CCCCCC"> ax is</font>

795
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,859
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become a member but but you</font>

796
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,460
know those are the ways to essentially

797
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:31,500
have a valid nonprofit organization yet

798
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,930
have an open membership and that's

799
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,369
pretty much what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know some</font>

800
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are happy with the outcome of the</font>

801
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:39,359
membership working group and other

802
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:40,619
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are unhappy I think one of the</font>

803
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,150
things we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to learn here is</font>

804
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:47,730
that when you have a working group of 14

805
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,770
or 15 people we probably got the very

806
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:52,680
best output capable from a working group

807
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:54,450
of 14 or 15 people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

808
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations mature they start to</font>

809
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,098
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that maybe when you have huge</font>

810
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,950
groups it's very hard to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

811
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:03,450
consensus that pleases everyone I think

812
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will see the wheat other working</font>

813
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,200
groups that were smaller and I think the

814
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:09,869
output of those groups is probably going

815
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,149
to cause much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a of a big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to-do</font>

816
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:15,119
and that may be because it's it's a lot

817
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:17,099
easier to to come to a consensus when

818
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,510
there is a smaller number of people the

819
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:21,480
other issue to keep in mind here as well

820
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:22,770
and I'll shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> up is that when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

821
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,099
working groups that had the job of

822
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:28,080
coming up with specific deliverables you

823
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,160
know the membership working group you

824
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,720
know was much more pie in the sky

825
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,118
where's things like the development

826
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group those X ponsor ships or</font>

827
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,630
the budget working group that was about

828
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,520
producing a budget it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a work</font>

829
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,200
process I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to come up</font>

830
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,720
with a spreadsheet that says X or Y and

831
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,060
the numbers up to work with a membership

832
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,529
working group I think the best thing to

833
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">do moving forward is to say what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

834
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:52,050
lessons our listens might be maybe not

835
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,450
14 or 15 people and maybe clear

836
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,640
direction from the board and maybe more

837
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,109
constrained choices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's</font>

838
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,310
that's what you learn when you start a

839
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:03,520
new organization and that's what we're

840
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:06,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

841
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:11,780
and you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other controversial</font>

842
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:14,870
bits were having having a fellow<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

843
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:17,210
on a node futures a fellow membership

844
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,640
class nano futures I think Chris

845
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:23,030
explained fairly well what the rationale

846
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:28,819
there was in terms of being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

847
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">a recognition for outstanding service to</font>

848
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:34,970
the community but within our own

849
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:37,820
umbrella it is worth noting that you

850
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:39,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if it remains a hot topic the board</font>

fellows and eventually the language

853
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:47,780
could be struck as in within the next

within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next voting cycle you know if</font>

855
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:58,900
the feedback will determine how that

856
00:40:51,020 --> 00:41:01,940
progresses Marty's is on this slide I

863
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:21,140
won't really get in into that too much

864
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,310
and I'm not subscribed to the futures

865
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,529
mailing list so I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

866
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:27,440
what's transpired with relation to a

867
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:30,410
discussion I think I heard that Randy

868
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,510
had made some rather interesting

869
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,720
comments with regards to some of the

870
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:37,340
topics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're discussing here today</font>

871
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,899
hi I guess I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feeling with this</font>

872
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:42,680
membership stuff I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really support</font>

873
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,090
it I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> said obnoxious and I guess I</font>

874
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,589
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be insulting</font>

875
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,800
because you guys are doing a lot of hard

876
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,390
work and I do appreciate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

877
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that I would be anywhere near</font>

878
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,629
where I am today without nanog and it's

879
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,580
already hard enough to come to an end

880
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,010
i'm meeting as a newcomer and meet

881
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,650
people and learn things and participate

882
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:03,950
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the language</font>

883
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:07,460
here really at least in my opinion seems

884
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:10,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that a little bit harder I don't</font>

885
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:13,570
know why you guys decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> embark upon</font>

886
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,900
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach I would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

887
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,099
hearing why in a sentence or two and I

888
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:24,250
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to let you know that I</font>

889
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:25,990
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> support thanks i'll let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ken RS</font>

00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:33,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually address some of that but the</font>

891
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:35,020
the the Booker plate was I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E so a</font>

892
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,589
lot of that comes out of there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

893
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:41,200
know what you're talk the front loading

894
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,730
the front loading oh sorry let me just

895
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,368
say the front loading of the lifetime

896
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:48,040
membership kind of stuff that's to build

897
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:49,690
the bank you said you worked on futures

898
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,800
that's Dan actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained that</font>

899
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:56,170
fairly well from the budgetary

900
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,970
perspective and really I hear what

901
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:01,180
you're saying about Nana helping to form

902
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:04,899
a lot of our current skills and

903
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:07,000
abilities and I think the difficulty in

904
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,410
travel is a very compelling reason to

905
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,710
move to a membership model that allows

906
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:14,910
people that can't necessarily make it

907
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:17,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">participate in a way I think it's worth</font>

908
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,240
noting that the purpose of membership is

909
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,560
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have as a pool of people who</font>

910
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,950
are eligible to vote on corporate

911
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,770
matters not to just in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

912
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:28,450
my opinion not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that set of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

913
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,619
are eligible to come to meetings or to

914
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,618
participate on the mailing list or

915
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:33,849
whatever those are in my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> be no by</font>

916
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:36,940
coupled and I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of this</font>

917
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:38,440
tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that there are two other</font>

918
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,820
things that membership model can do one

919
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,310
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is a revenue stream which is</font>

920
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,420
always a good thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind the third</font>

921
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:46,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think has been tossed</font>

922
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,550
around a bit though I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what</font>

923
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:50,680
how much was really talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font>

924
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,520
that it was to come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way of</font>

925
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly recognizing one's peers</font>

926
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,300
certainly there I Triple E has a

927
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,980
membership model where you you join and

928
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,320
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be recognized as an engineer</font>

929
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,970
and so on I don't know if you want to go

930
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,040
down that route or not but not maybe

931
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:07,660
it's a worthwhile discussion to have and

932
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,800
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that would end up telling</font>

933
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,960
us what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of membership model we</font>

934
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,310
really want but things to keep in mind

935
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,540
ur we do need members that we could have

936
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:18,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who can vote that's important and</font>

937
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:22,538
revenue stream from said members is the

938
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,709
thing and speaking of revenue stream

939
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:28,999
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there well there's some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

940
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:31,489
comments coming along John Springer and

941
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:36,169
Lynn telephone am I correct in assuming

942
00:44:31,489 --> 00:44:39,259
that we are all members for all the

943
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,699
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room at present</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

944
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,559
the definition of the membership within

945
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:45,140
the within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the very first</font>

946
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">election everybody is a member for after</font>

947
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,819
the first election you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be a you</font>

948
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:52,400
have to join to be a member so that

949
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:54,049
hasn't been explicitly stated before now

950
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,749
at least that I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> paying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

951
00:44:54,049 --> 00:45:00,019
so the whole business<font color="#E5E5E5"> about anybody can</font>

952
00:44:56,749 --> 00:45:03,098
vote who's attended a nanog meeting in

00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,199
the board determines the qualifications

<font color="#E5E5E5">for membership and just leaves it at</font>

a bylaws vote thumbs up and thumbs down

the thumbs up is accepting the

membership structure as it is there's no

the multiple type of membership sort of

things set up or why we chose a

membership structure at all membership

1000
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:26,140
to provide a group of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

legally qualified to vote for the board

1004
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:35,950
me so let me just offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a few more</font>

1005
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,799
points of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first of</font>

1006
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:40,180
all I am going to vote<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes to adopt all</font>

1007
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:41,410
of this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you guys are talking</font>

1008
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,730
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

1009
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:47,019
always pluck and turn out of the punch

1010
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:49,660
bowl so to speak I think I'm going to

1011
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:53,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to put that in my list of quotes</font>

1012
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:55,359
section but secondly I and I will take

1013
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:57,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step of saying i do find the</font>

1014
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,819
membership classifications obnoxious and

1015
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:02,950
perhaps you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a membership</font>

1016
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:05,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we pay 50 bucks and get a card that</font>

1017
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,970
says whoopee<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog and that we can go to</font>

1018
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,480
like micro center and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a discount or</font>

1019
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:12,339
something I but that might cheapen it as

1020
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,829
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a balance that needs</font>

1021
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:15,788
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> established with whatever</font>

1022
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:17,970
membership approach that you take but I

1023
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:20,529
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the top</font>

1024
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:22,238
got your hat thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> volunteering</font>

1025
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:25,049
for the membership working group will

1026
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,049
expect you on the

1027
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:29,920
if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty percent</font>

1028
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:31,420

1029
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:38,349
the membership working group I'd love to

1030
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:40,029
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it thank you no I will say again I</font>

1031
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:42,459
can't speak for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole board but at</font>

1032
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:44,049
least for myself there seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1033
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:45,759
sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> disagreement on this topic</font>

1034
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:47,019
that I think we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go</font>

1035
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the drawing board and figure out</font>

1036
00:48:47,019 --> 00:48:52,089
what the membership model should look

1037
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:53,650
like at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my perspective I</font>

1038
00:48:52,089 --> 00:48:55,479
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's worth voting for the</font>

1039
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:58,119
bylaws assuming that that's the only

1040
00:48:55,479 --> 00:49:01,538
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have with them this is</font>

1041
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:03,309
kind of for everybody and at least for

1042
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:06,219
myself as a board member I will pledge

1043
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:09,759
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and and we visit the number</font>

1044
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:12,160
shifting and submit something to the

1045
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:15,549
community later that we can discuss and

1046
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,229
also to not do anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would make</font>

1047
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:18,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">that impossible later like I'll ecting</font>

1048
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:21,009
that doesn't fellows next week or

1049
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:26,078
anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PTAC from yahoo</font>

1050
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:28,299
if we pass the bylaws as amended we all

1051
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,939
cease to be members<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday afternoon</font>

1052
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:37,630
how would we vote for change at that

1053
00:49:30,939 --> 00:49:39,368
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> established pay this</font>

1054
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:43,209
amount of cash and suddenly you get to

1055
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:49,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">vote for change excellent well that that</font>

1056
00:49:43,209 --> 00:49:53,410
that is that it what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need too</font>

1057
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:54,999
much you do the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your question</font>

1058
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,109
is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote for the new bylaws then</font>

1059
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:57,339
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is in there if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you pay a</font>

1060
00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:59,529
hundred bucks or whatever the number is

1061
00:49:57,339 --> 00:50:01,569
then you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> member and vote in</font>

1062
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:04,329
future elections if you do if the new

1063
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:05,829
bylaws are not voted in then the

1064
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:07,929
alignment language that's in the bylaws

1065
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:09,130
says that the board gets to set will

1066
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:11,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort being members and we can do</font>

1067
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever we feel like so that may give</font>

1068
00:50:11,019 --> 00:50:18,399
you an incentive to vote for the new

1069
00:50:12,729 --> 00:50:20,558
ones I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reemphasize the point</font>

1070
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,099
that was made earlier I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Joe made</font>

1071
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,099
the point that

1072
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:30,279
better is the enemy of good enough and

1073
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:32,709
where the question is are we moving in a

1074
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:37,350
positive direction sort of incrementally

1075
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:40,869
as we reevaluate our our rules and our

1076
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:42,819
membership qualifications and all that

1077
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:46,840
other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year we've</font>

1078
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:48,369
certainly had charter amendments every

1079
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:53,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">year except for every meeting except for</font>

1080
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:56,440
one every year except for one and so I

1081
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:59,430
fully expect that there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

1082
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:04,210
plethora of charter amendment proposals

1083
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:06,419
next year and the year after I don't

1084
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:08,170
think any of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> colleagues here are</font>

1085
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,040
representing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're getting at a</font>

1086
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:15,520
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time and</font>

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear especially</font>

1088
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,680
after a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of watching and</font>

00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:22,780
seeing how it works recommendations and

suggestions from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole community on</font>

1091
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:32,760
how to improve it David firmer

1092
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:35,430
university Minnesota I think there's the

1093
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">point that was made that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1094
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:41,319
eligibility before voting is an

1095
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:44,619
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and while I may have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1096
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,050
concerns about that when I first just

1097
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked at this and not had seen all the</font>

1098
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:51,940
stuff it didn't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1099
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">about eligibility for voting it felt</font>

1100
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:57,250
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was about who could participate</font>

1101
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:59,919
and how they can I understand them now

1102
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:01,750
but but I area<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font>

1103
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,550
is you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that more clear and</font>

1104
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,530
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that needs to go in</font>

1105
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bylaws is just how we talk about it</font>

1106
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:09,490
how we do it how we communicate it how

1107
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,049
we put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mailing list yes is all</font>

1108
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:13,209
about just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the membership but it's</font>

1109
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:15,250
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that care enough to</font>

1110
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:17,320
be in this room we expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of</font>

1111
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:19,150
the bucket of the membership the people

1112
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,890
is the people that don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1113
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,480
participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the process they can</font>

1114
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,810
still do everything they just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1115
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,550
to be laden with this and so the only

1116
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:30,250
thing that I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mention that</font>

1117
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:32,460
relates to that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also when you use the</font>

1118
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:35,470
said the I Triple E was the example

1119
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,500
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case in the I Triple E so</font>

1120
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,359
that's an important

1121
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,160
station between what you're talking

1122
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,810
about and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Triple E model I hear</font>

1123
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,000
you if I said example that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an error</font>

1124
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:46,610
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> boilerplate is what i meant for</font>

1125
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,680
the actual tears well and but in in

1126
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:51,860
whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> said is fine but to but I</font>

1127
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,910
recognized it and that's part of the

1128
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,310
baggage that comes along with

1129
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,859
recognizing it is jump as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model if</font>

1130
00:52:55,310 --> 00:53:01,820
you're using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's part</font>

1131
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:03,740
of the baggage gotcha understood one

1132
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:07,480
more from the floor yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font>

1133
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:12,169
Michael Sinatra UC Berkeley is there an

1134
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:15,310
intent to provide discounts for meeting

1135
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:18,860
fees registration fees for nanog members

1136
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:20,990
that while not codified in anything that

1137
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are that that's currently on the</font>

1138
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">table or for vote that's definitely been</font>

1139
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:27,560
you know gosh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if we do membership</font>

1140
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,660
its voting gosh that sounds not like a

1141
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:33,710
win sometimes that sounds like more work

1142
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:36,589
so things like you know extending what

1143
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:39,320
is the equivalent of early bird or you

1144
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there are a lot of different things</font>

1145
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are part and parcel of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the intent</font>

1146
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,560
of the membership working group after

1147
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:49,820
we've actually got the structure a

1148
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,380
streamlining it so that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> membership</font>

1149
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,270
is happening the community is happy with

1150
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,890
what the membership is and be defining

1151
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:56,750
what a bunch of the benefits are so

1152
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:58,009
discount meetings is an obvious one

1153
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,570
whether it's you know discounts at

1154
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:03,290
microcenter or something or deal with

1155
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:05,750
o'er<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> li whatever but that that as far</font>

1156
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">as the board is concerned is 0 is a wide</font>

1157
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,680
open field so just a comment based on

1158
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,260
that and based on some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

1159
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,270
comments that have made if you are going

1160
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:17,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that it you have to be very</font>

1161
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:18,620
careful to make sure that the there is

1162
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:20,000
still a certain amount of decoupling

1163
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,130
between the membership and the

1164
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,930
participant notion that you're not

1165
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:25,550
extending so many benefits<font color="#CCCCCC"> to members</font>

1166
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:29,180
that you feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be a</font>

1167
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:30,560
member just to participate so I know

1168
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,830
that's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no I'm not volunteering</font>

1169
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:36,620
to help out to define it how did you

1170
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:37,970
know what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to say but but you</font>

1171
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,339
know on the flipside we will want to

1172
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the membership benefits interesting</font>

1173
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,000
enough where some of the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

1174
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,700
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interested in this room but might</font>

1175
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,150
find it interesting to you know make a

1176
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,430
little make a little uh oh

1177
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,750
worm on the hook to dangle but I think

1178
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:54,149
one of the ideas that was sort of

1179
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,470
bandied about was the idea that if you

1180
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,869
go to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain number of nanog</font>

1181
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:59,189
conferences a year that you know at some

1182
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:01,140
point you hit break even with your

1183
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:02,819
membership for you that was sort of

1184
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,890
discussed in general but i just wanna

1185
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:08,759
say i endorsed the microcenter discount

1186
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:14,940
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool yeah fries two fries</font>

1187
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:16,799
there we go and I see one more right I

1188
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:19,710
mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Julie egg llegan I think</font>

1189
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:23,160
one of the exercises with having a paid

1190
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:25,740
membership is that um you know obviously

1191
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,509
when eligibility changes there are

1192
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who participate in the nanana</font>

1193
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:33,960
community who do not attend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meetings</font>

1194
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:37,169
some of them are trolls but they can now

1195
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:40,289
become part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nanog process by</font>

1196
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:42,089
becoming members exactly i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i tried</font>

1197
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:45,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say that but I didn't say it as</font>

1198
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:47,279
succinctly earlier while we were having

1199
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this discussion I left him I left the</font>

1200
00:55:47,279 --> 00:55:52,920
the previous financial slide up and and

1201
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:55,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">flipped to this one because well staring</font>

1202
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,270
at a slide of numbers isn't always the

1203
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,920
best way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually analyze numbers so</font>

1204
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,329
please feel free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

1208
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:16,170

00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have been saying all along it is</font>

1210
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">expected to be iterative and there will</font>

be refinement as we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:33,119
actually on track<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right next up</font>

some by law is produced

1218

hi so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here representing the</font>

1219
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:57,899
governance working group we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had</font>

1220
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,460
a pretty large amount we heard the

1221
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:02,460
working group open to anyone who wanted

1222
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:04,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join we ended up with a pretty large</font>

1223
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,839
mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to list all</font>

1224
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,450
the lurkers here I went through quickly

1225
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:11,880
before the meeting to just try to make

1226
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:15,240
to attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure I had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complete</font>

1227
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:18,839
list of those who had actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> commented</font>

1228
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,549
in the discussion and this is what I

1229
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:22,470
came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and like two minutes of</font>

1230
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:24,210
looking over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list on my iPhone so if</font>

1231
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:31,078
I missed anyone who was involved I

1232
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:34,859
apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but anyway so the so</font>

1233
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:37,380
we created the draft bylaws which which

1234
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:39,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you have looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at we</font>

1235
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,220
were responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything in there</font>

1236
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:44,160
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the membership section which</font>

1237
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:47,069
we can you know say hey that we have no

1238
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that at all that was</font>

1239
00:57:47,069 --> 00:57:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">created by the membership working group</font>

1240
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:54,480
and for the non membership portion which

1241
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:58,290
is what we were responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it was</font>

1242
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:01,559
mostly a document merge of the existing

1243
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:05,099
nanog<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter and the temporary nu nog</font>

1244
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:08,490
bylaws that were created by I guess new

1245
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">nogs attorney and Steve Feldman so</font>

1246
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:12,348
basically we tried to take the nonprofit

1247
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,609
way we played out of that and the

1248
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:18,119
otherwise the structure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1249
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:20,848
existing nanak charter we did make a few

1250
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:22,980
changes there is an elected board that

1251
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:24,750
actually has authority as opposed to the

1252
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:27,690
steering<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee that was advisory to</font>

1253
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:31,530
merit we've added this executive

1254
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:33,059
director position who I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1255
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:34,380
somebody who's going to do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1256
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:37,380
things that may I used to do for

1257
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:39,299
bruneian ugh and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> executive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> director</font>

1258
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,470
will also serve as a board member partly

1259
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:45,299
this was a way to elect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same number</font>

1260
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">of board members every year and still</font>

1261
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:51,089
end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an odd number 44 tiebreaking</font>

1262
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,098
and partly it was just felt that the

1263
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:54,450
executive director would have enough of

1264
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:58,660
a stake in this that they should have

1265
00:58:54,450 --> 00:59:01,960
that authority we

1266
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:05,440
the executive director is selected by

1267
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,110
the elected members of the board so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1268
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,100
still have flexibility in there if the

1269
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:11,650
executive director is doing something

1270
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:13,210
the board really disapproves of to the

1271
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,730
elected people really disagree about for

1272
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:17,860
them to remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that person so it doesn't</font>

1273
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:18,880
really make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> executive director</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

1274
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:22,090
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful than they otherwise</font>

1275
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:25,870
would be we<font color="#CCCCCC"> added a couple of extra</font>

1276
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:29,050
committees the the existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter had</font>

1277
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:30,310
the program committee the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Communications</font>

1278
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Committee which does the mailing list</font>

1279
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:40,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the sponsorship committee I believe</font>

1280
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:43,300
maybe it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just those two I forget but</font>

1281
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:45,970
anyway we added the the membership and

1282
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">development committee which is going to</font>

1283
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:50,640
be responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for fundraising either</font>

1284
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:53,259
through memberships or sponsorships and

1285
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,819
the Budget and Finance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Committee which</font>

1286
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:59,980
as its name suggests sis can be

1287
00:59:54,820 --> 01:00:01,960
responsible for budgeting and the other

1288
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:04,690
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other point that I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make here</font>

1289
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:07,270
is we tried hard to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this very</font>

1290
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:10,000
amendable because we assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got</font>

1291
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,680
a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong so five years ago</font>

1292
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was we were working on the</font>

1293
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing nanak charter we stuck in a</font>

1294
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:21,280
clause that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the members of</font>

1295
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,630
nanog which at the time was defined as

1296
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,630
everybody had<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the meeting in the</font>

1297
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:29,950
last two years could amend the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter</font>

1298
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:31,450
with some small percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1299
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:33,790
membership putting something on a ballot

1300
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:36,910
and then majority vote at the annual

1301
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:39,009
election this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we kept that</font>

1302
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:41,890
provision obviously it goes to the new

1303
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">definition of membership to amend that</font>

1304
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:46,390
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also added another temporary</font>

1305
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:47,830
clause for the first year just in case

1306
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:50,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">we got something really wrong right off</font>

1307
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:52,330
the bat or perhaps more likely in case

1308
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,830
the IRS came back and said you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1309
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,990
provision in here that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> incompatible</font>

1310
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:57,279
with 501 C 3 and you need to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1311
01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:00,700
or your contributions won't be tax

1312
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,950
deductible so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added the second</font>

1313
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,990
provision in there which says that if

1314
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,730
the board the bylaws can be amended

1315
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:08,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">temporarily if the board votes</font>

1316
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:12,020
unanimously to change them

1317
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:13,700
and the temporary amendment will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1318
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:15,200
until the next annual election a year

1319
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,669
from now which point the membership

1320
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,850
would have to ratify the amendment or

1321
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:21,560
else it would revert so I think what I'm

1322
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:23,600
hearing from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion right now</font>

1323
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,610
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been well I guess you guys haven't</font>

1324
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:29,660
had the chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start throwing the</font>

1325
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:31,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron fake tomatoes at me yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but as far</font>

1326
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,020
as far as I can tell from what's going

1327
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:37,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">out on the mailing list it sounds like</font>

1328
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:38,420
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complaints about you</font>

1329
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,890
know are a lot of opinions partly on

1330
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:43,970
both sides about what the membership

1331
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:45,650
working group came up with and nobody

1332
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:48,919
seems to care nearly as much about the

1333
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:51,860
rest of what's in here but so I think

1334
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:55,930
what I'm hearing from this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1335
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:58,780
you guys vote yes on the bylaws here and

1336
01:01:55,930 --> 01:02:02,629
yet nobody likes the membership section

1337
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:04,490
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process in here whereby that</font>

1338
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:06,170
membership provision can be temporary

1339
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:10,069
and can be changed to pretty much

1340
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:11,780
anything that anybody who pays a hundred

1341
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,100
dollars for anybody who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to</font>

1342
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:16,910
pay a hundred dollars to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vote</font>

1343
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:18,140
can go change later so the the current

1344
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:20,270
membership stuff if it's really

1345
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,640
unpopular is<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore at must the next</font>

1346
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:25,220
year and anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else in here that we</font>

1347
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,950
get wrong again if this gets approved

1348
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:32,839
can be changed a year from now so

1349
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:34,819
hopefully that means that that people

1350
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:37,340
can go ahead and approve this and then

1351
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:42,730
go change it later and deal with

1352
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:42,730
whatever the whatever the criticisms are

1353
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:48,410
think that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for what I have to</font>

1354
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:51,590
say any I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill Norton is jumping up</font>

1355
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:54,980
and any other questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments turn</font>

1356
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:57,350
tomatoes now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good time I guess I'm</font>

1357
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,940
just wondering um Steve I really

1358
01:02:57,350 --> 01:03:02,600
appreciate what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said about the</font>

1359
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:05,030
taking to heart the concerns folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1360
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:07,960
raised about the membership and I

1361
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:11,030
appreciate we're putting our faith in

1362
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:13,460
you and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> steering committee to go</font>

1363
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:16,250
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make some changes or at least</font>

1364
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:17,690
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at the membership rules I'm</font>

1365
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:21,999
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking through that the</font>

1366
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:24,099
process we vote thumbs up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the bylaws</font>

1367
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:28,779
accepting that the Syrian committee

1368
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:31,539
might go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scratch with respect to</font>

1369
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:35,859
the membership rules but you do have the

1370
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:38,349
issue of who who pays membership fees

1371
01:03:35,859 --> 01:03:39,519
now and lifetime fees and and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

1372
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:41,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff maybe you put the fellows</font>

1373
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,198
stuff aside and just forget about the

1374
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:46,479
fellow stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> altogether but will you</font>

1375
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:49,539
accept the lifetime fees with the

1376
01:03:46,479 --> 01:03:51,908
essentially a contract that by accepting

1377
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:54,369
lifetime fees for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years people won't</font>

1378
01:03:51,909 --> 01:03:55,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I considers the life you want</font>

1379
01:03:54,369 --> 01:03:58,959
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay whatever membership fees</font>

1380
01:03:55,659 --> 01:04:00,219
come up so one of the you know one of

1381
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:02,709
the features that we tried to keep in

1382
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:06,099
mind both five years ago with the

1383
01:04:02,709 --> 01:04:08,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter and now is that the things that</font>

1384
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:12,219
you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set in stone are the</font>

1385
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:14,079
voting process and the you know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

1386
01:04:12,219 --> 01:04:15,639
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the board because if you have a</font>

1387
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,069
dispute<font color="#E5E5E5"> about who your board is then you</font>

1388
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:20,169
can get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know into a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1389
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:21,699
really intense power struggles whereas

1390
01:04:20,169 --> 01:04:26,949
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know who has the authority then</font>

1391
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:30,579
somebody can make a decision so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1392
01:04:26,949 --> 01:04:32,109
so the membership stuff you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1393
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:35,859
various classes of membership are in

1394
01:04:32,109 --> 01:04:38,439
there the<font color="#E5E5E5"> appointment of fellows and the</font>

1395
01:04:35,859 --> 01:04:43,019
setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fees and all that was left to</font>

1396
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:45,609
the board so I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1397
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:49,089
what happens to the fees for lifetime

1398
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:54,459
membership does that stuff get accepted

1399
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:57,669
now I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I I suppose the board</font>

1400
01:04:54,459 --> 01:05:00,399
could either you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know decline to set a</font>

1401
01:04:57,669 --> 01:05:02,078
fee for lifetime membership or if that's

1402
01:05:00,399 --> 01:05:04,929
not practical set the fee so high that

1403
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,369
nobody would possibly pay it if they

1404
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:10,209
wanted to take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the table for</font>

1405
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:11,289
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment beyond that I guess you know</font>

1406
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:13,928
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as what would go into an</font>

1407
01:05:11,289 --> 01:05:15,459
amendment and whether those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1408
01:05:13,929 --> 01:05:17,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">be amended out of their membership or</font>

1409
01:05:15,459 --> 01:05:21,279
something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really up to</font>

1410
01:05:17,259 --> 01:05:24,219
how the amendment gets worded and the

1411
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:26,679
voters next time around and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

1412
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:32,490
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can speak for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the namek voters on</font>

1413
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:34,350
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what that does lead to is</font>

1414
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:35,700
you know who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> elect to the board is</font>

1415
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:37,500
important i don't think there's anybody

1416
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:41,060
on the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> can that list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to looks</font>

1417
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:43,710
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll be really nefarious but and</font>

1418
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:46,950
you know how this next two min how this

1419
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:48,869
next amendment gets worded and whether

1420
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:51,029
it gets voted for is also important but

1421
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:53,040
hopefully we can trust our whoever gets

1422
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:55,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">elected to the board and the membership</font>

1423
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,460
that does that voting enough to you know

1424
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,490
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we get a reasonable outcome</font>

1425
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:02,070
out of that let's be really clear here

1426
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:03,240
this is a membership organization even

1427
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">if the board changes it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1428
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:08,040
ratified by the membership that<font color="#E5E5E5"> x vote</font>

1429
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:09,360
right first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all second of all there's</font>

1430
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,800
nothing stopping the membership from

1431
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,570
changing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever the board decides</font>

1432
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick the fees out you guys get upset</font>

1433
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:16,470
you center membership an amendment

1434
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:18,690
somebody pays their thousand bucks or

1435
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:20,129
whatever it is and it they could be

1436
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:21,510
turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the next time anyway just</font>

1437
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:23,430
buy the whole membership doesn't have to

1438
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:25,170
be just the board everything is fluid

1439
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:27,180
this is true whether it's nanog or your

1440
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">housing association or somebody teaching</font>

1441
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:32,549
you how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> shoot guns for something that</font>

1442
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:34,529
we either have faith in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization</font>

1443
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:35,550
or we don't and if you worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

1444
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:38,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">then pay the hundred bucks and don't</font>

1445
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:40,170
worry about the lifetime if you have

1446
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,490
faith in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it then and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that your</font>

1455
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:00,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are really problems</font>

1456
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:02,279
that we should be desperately worried

1457
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,690
about it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to like discuss if you</font>

1458
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,490
want but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anybody's really worried</font>

1459
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:06,630
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that oh well they said it</font>

1460
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:09,359
for a thousand bucks they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

1461
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:10,619
it because it full election of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the onion</font>

01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">animas vote of the board could change</font>

1463
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:13,830
the bylaws and remove my lifetime

1464
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:16,020
membership if that's really what you're

1465
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:17,850
worried about then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1466
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:20,640
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have faith in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the entirety of</font>

1467
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:22,319
nanog because that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you think</font>

1468
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,819
the rest of the people in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room and</font>

1469
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,130
out in the hallways and on the mailing

1470
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:28,890
list are going to ratify an amendment

1471
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:31,590
that's going to in some way hurt you and

1472
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:33,330
I I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't feel that way about</font>

1473
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:35,160
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that you know I</font>

1474
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,779
trade male with a lot even though some

1475
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them really don't like me I still</font>

1476
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:41,319
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way about them so</font>

1477
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:44,739
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys don't either</font>

1478
01:07:41,319 --> 01:07:47,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">don wellmerit network you made statement</font>

1479
01:07:44,739 --> 01:07:49,410
earlier that the executive director

1480
01:07:47,619 --> 01:07:51,309
would serve at the pleasure of the board

1481
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:54,190
therefore limiting the power of the

1482
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">executive director the board is going to</font>

1483
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:57,699
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> term limited so they're going to</font>

1484
01:07:55,690 --> 01:08:00,190
rotate periodically the executive

1485
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:03,670
director will theoretically have some

1486
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:06,489
long some longevity within the

1487
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:08,979
organization you're going to have

1488
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:10,839
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like two professional</font>

1489
01:08:08,979 --> 01:08:13,448
staff the executive director<font color="#CCCCCC"> and an</font>

1490
01:08:10,839 --> 01:08:14,890
assistant is what I've seen so far so I

1491
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:16,960
would submit the executive director is

1492
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:19,420
going to be incredibly powerful because

1493
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,069
the institutional knowledge of running

1494
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:24,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">your organization is going to reside in</font>

1495
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:26,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the executive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> director especially with a</font>

1496
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:28,540
with short term limits on the on the

1497
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:33,098
board so you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider that</font>

1498
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:34,988
balance of power<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks so the ed is</font>

1499
01:08:33,099 --> 01:08:37,389
going to be amazingly powerful because

1500
01:08:34,988 --> 01:08:39,189
he's not he or she will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only be you</font>

1501
01:08:37,389 --> 01:08:40,779
know everything dawn said he's also

1502
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:43,919
going to have a seat on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board pardon</font>

1503
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:45,940
me if I keep saying he<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously we have</font>

1504
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,230
absolutely no preference for that nobody

1505
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:53,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sunni</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I said so um the but we</font>

1506
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:56,229
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we can satisfy the</font>

1507
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:58,509
balance of power correctly and having

1508
01:08:56,229 --> 01:09:00,939
been on nonprofit boards in fact

1509
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:02,979
existing nonprofit boards that have term

1510
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:05,138
limits and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs</font>

1511
01:09:02,979 --> 01:09:06,519
and things like that I don't see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

1512
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:09,279
problem if you make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right choice</font>

1513
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:11,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus remember we say they serve at the</font>

1514
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:14,799
pleasure of the board but the membership

1515
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,569
is the final straw anybody really hates

1516
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:19,599
the ED they can make an amendment that

1517
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:21,009
says we fire the ed and there's nothing

1518
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:22,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the board can do about it if the</font>

1519
01:09:21,009 --> 01:09:24,759
membership votes on it remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

1520
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:26,020

1521
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:28,328
because honestly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys don't have</font>

1522
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:31,869
time neither do we but you guys don't

1525
01:09:33,578 --> 01:09:37,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">like something just float an amendment</font>

1526
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:39,250
get people to vote<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it and it's done</font>

1527
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:44,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there's not a goddamn thing anybody</font>

1528
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:46,600
up here can do about it nor would<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1533
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:07,190
move on the development working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

1534
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:09,589
Chris couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1535
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:12,219
Sylvie did you volunteer to talk about

1536
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:12,220
development

1537
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:22,909
so they on the developing a working

1538
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:25,820
group it was led by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christopher Cassata</font>

01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:34,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">some members and what they come up with</font>

1541
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:37,250
I'm sorry is what they were first task

1542
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:41,120
which is to find additional sponsorship

1543
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:43,730
for 2011 2012 so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a proper</font>

1544
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,760
structure in place so what they decide

1545
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:48,290
is that there would be little change

1546
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,929
from an intern and attendees point of

1547
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:53,659

1548
01:10:50,929 --> 01:10:56,659
remains the<font color="#CCCCCC"> brakes also remain the same</font>

1549
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:59,269
and the marketing or the sales will

1550
01:10:56,659 --> 01:11:02,330
continue to be minimized<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want this to</font>

1551
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:05,480
remain nanog what they've introduced is

1552
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:08,480
a greater flexibility for sponsors and

1553
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:10,718
this is um this came from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feedback</font>

1554
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:14,178
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marketing Committee received</font>

1555
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:19,360
over the past two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years so they came up</font>

1556
01:11:14,179 --> 01:11:19,360
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sponsorship structure that allows</font>

1557
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:25,489
sponsors to provide money for a calendar

1558
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:28,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">year and not necessarily couple it to</font>

1559
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:30,589
sponsoring just one event or one break

1560
01:11:28,639 --> 01:11:34,340
so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just changes that they've</font>

1561
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:40,940
introduced into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> structure and that's</font>

1562
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:42,949
it for now Thank you Thank You Sylvie

1563
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:46,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">and next up we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> damn to talk about</font>

1564
01:11:42,949 --> 01:11:46,239
the finance working group

1565
01:11:55,489 --> 01:12:01,019
I'll try to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as exciting as the</font>

1566
01:11:57,989 --> 01:12:06,809
membership stuff so the finance that's

1567
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:09,239
really thrilling whoo yeah good<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so</font>

1568
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:11,100
the finance group was a little bit

1569
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:14,388
smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> than some of the others was</font>

both Dwayne and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sylvie helped us out in</font>

1572
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:22,170
terms of being a liaison with the board

1573
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:24,420
we did do an open request for membership

1574
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,920
but this not being as exciting or

1575
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:29,850
controversial didn't get quite as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:33,719
folks our mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> our remit was twofold</font>

1577
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:35,730
one is way to create a budget this is a

1578
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:38,310
cash budget for an independent nanog

1579
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:40,138
organization starting immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> as in</font>

1580
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:43,219
today really starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about three months</font>

1581
01:12:40,139 --> 01:12:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago and running through the end of 2012</font>

1582
01:12:43,219 --> 01:12:47,580
we worked with a membership development

1583
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:49,679
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups to get inputs from them</font>

1584
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:51,659
on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of membership revenue we</font>

1585
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:55,170
can expect what kind of sponsorship

1586
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:58,469
revenue we could expect and the other

1587
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:59,610
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and that budget is done you</font>

1588
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:02,400
know we're waiting for board approval

1589
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:03,809
before it gets published a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1590
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,549
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen if anyone else here wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1591
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:07,739
see it it's in a flash<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive in my</font>

1592
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:10,590
pocket I'm happy to show to you after

1593
01:13:07,739 --> 01:13:14,218
this meeting concludes it's thrilling

1594
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:15,659
you know it's it's a budget the other

1595
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:18,630
part of our mission is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font>

1596
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:19,980
financial controls and systems these

1597
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:22,050
financial controls are designed to

1598
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:24,959
ensure that organization funds are being

1599
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:26,610
properly handled and to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1600
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,760
treasure to select and deploy a

our status the<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget is complete it's</font>

1603
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:35,550
been submitted with a non-profit

application the board is approving at

1605
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:40,260
this conference hopefully and because we

1606
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:41,428
coordinated with all the other groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1607
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,250
think it's been a pretty successful

01:13:41,429 --> 01:13:47,280
process for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the financial controls</font>

1609
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:48,750
aspect that was a secondary priority we

1610
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,179
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the budget done for the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">nonprofit application and also so that</font>

1612
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:57,480
people here this is we could see it

1613
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:59,940
me efforts are ongoing for financial

coordinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work so how did we</font>

1616
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:07,650
come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a budget on the revenue</font>

1617
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,360
side we work very closely with a

1618
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,280
membership group to figure out what the

1619
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:15,030
probable membership numbers and dues are

1620
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,440
and if it if it reassures anyone like

1621
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety five percent of the membership</font>

1622
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:21,839
revenue was coming from regular non

1623
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:23,760
special memberships where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

1624
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,430
paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> their hundred dollars a year and</font>

1625
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,830
becoming a member for a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

1626
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:30,900
was it we did work in some lifetime

1627
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:34,250
memberships which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially just</font>

1628
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:35,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of a forward donation to the group</font>

1629
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:38,670
unknown how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are actually</font>

1630
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:40,170
interested in doing that you know

1631
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:43,340
particular light of the fact there seems

1632
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:46,170
to be some you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard spots about it</font>

1633
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:47,690
and we put in some student memberships

1634
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the budgets that were discounted</font>

1635
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:53,790
because students have no money we also

1636
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:55,949
provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sounding board for the</font>

development working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group as they work</font>

1638
01:14:55,949 --> 01:15:00,239
they created about eight or<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine</font>

1639
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:02,010
different sponsorship models eventually

1640
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:04,669
we help them select the most

1642
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:10,020
there's two conferences in 2011 a

separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for 2012 the sponsorship</font>

1644
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:14,310
models were extremely conservative in

1645
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:16,019
terms of the revenue generated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

1646
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:18,030
really have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no doubt that we'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:23,130
a problem the expense side was

1649
01:15:20,699 --> 01:15:26,820
considerably trickier we really have

1650
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:29,250
pretty limited data on what nanog

1651
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:30,900
conferences cost to run we in the

1652

<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregate we know you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font>

1653

1654
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,940
conferences but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you attempt to sort</font>

know which piece goes into which

1657
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:43,350
particular bug at bucket because of the

1658
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:45,269
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> mayor was a merited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Minister nanog</font>

1659
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:47,610
as a program we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really have a lot</font>

1660
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of super detailed financial knowledge</font>

1661
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:51,929
but because we have the sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of larger</font>

1662
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:54,059
aggregate numbers we can sort of see is

1663
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:55,949
the revenue going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet the</font>

1664
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:57,980
expense numbers we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely</font>

1665
01:15:55,949 --> 01:16:00,719
conservative on the expense side

1666
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:02,019
assuming we did not assume any cost

1667
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,140
savings at all and

1668
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:07,480
fact we assumed considerable costs above

1669
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:10,030
and beyond what<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on today so very</font>

1670
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:12,549
very conservative and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also included a</font>

1671
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:15,190
large budgetary buffer for all line

1672
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:18,580
items this is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> line item budget</font>

1673
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:19,990
this is a 50 line item budget with with

1674
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:23,350
a great deal of detail and a great deal

1675
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:25,080
of buffer now some areas are not going

1676
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:27,970
to be clear until we want to conference

1677
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:30,010
until we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the bills and</font>

1678
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:31,960
do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analysis of the bills that</font>

1679
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:34,570
come in we will be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the really</font>

1680
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:37,080
fine fine grain budgeting that we'd like

1681
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:39,790
to do but we're still pretty confident

1682
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:42,040
now one question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is did we do this in a</font>

1683
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:44,590
smoke-filled room the answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1684
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:46,000
much no there was great public there was

1685
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:48,130
a public<font color="#CCCCCC"> Invitational working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

1686
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,410
participation the only requirement was

1687
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:52,150
financial accounting knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font>

1688
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:55,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was a requirement but this is a</font>

about that I'm play to devil's advocate

01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:59,380
we had people who provide a tremendous

how much association management or event

were ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say to the board this is</font>

is viable and we are reasonably sure

that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only viable but it's not</font>

things are up and running it's viable by

all its ov address this one this will be

1805
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:41,059
a part of the RFP so we're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

an RFP for association management IT and

1807
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:48,730
also conference management so the RFP

1808
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:51,020
will be open so it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a for-profit</font>

01:21:55,130 --> 01:22:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to say that it is possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things like conference websites the</font>

500 other you know similar nonprofits

1820
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:24,349
they tend to get really good at

1821
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:26,449
and a good example this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the ITF</font>

1822
01:22:24,349 --> 01:22:29,059
utilizes a firm that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does this for them</font>

1823
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:30,768
and it allows you not to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge</font>

1824
01:22:29,059 --> 01:22:33,349
professional staff which is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1825
01:22:30,769 --> 01:22:35,679
think everyone wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid I think we</font>

some ridiculous bureaucracy hey Dan good

01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:51,889
just like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> he bootstrapped it so</font>

1832
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:53,809
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not impossible if your buckets</font>

1833
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:55,280
don't feel like you anticipate what's

1834
01:22:53,809 --> 01:22:57,050
your contingency plan do you have a line

1835
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,938
<font color="#CCCCCC">of credit or are you able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to obtain a</font>

1836
01:22:57,050 --> 01:23:01,459
lot of credit because if the buckets

1837
01:22:58,939 --> 01:23:03,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">fall short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you take money to you</font>

1838
01:23:01,459 --> 01:23:05,749
take attendance fees and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have to hold the beating it would be</font>

1840
01:23:05,749 --> 01:23:10,610
catastrophic failure if we didn't and I

1841
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:12,469
would expect that perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may not</font>

1842
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:14,299
actually realize as much revenue as you

1843
01:23:12,469 --> 01:23:16,340
expect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time out the gate and</font>

1844
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,570
that it would be reasonable to buffer

1845
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:18,559
some of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a line of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1846
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:20,239
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get something about some</font>

1847
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:22,189
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a great question I I</font>

1848
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:24,919
could not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have set that up better if I</font>

1849
01:23:22,189 --> 01:23:26,659
tried one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my biggest concerns about</font>

1850
01:23:24,919 --> 01:23:29,209
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization was how do we get</font>

1851
01:23:26,659 --> 01:23:31,879
enough money initially to fund it until

1852
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:33,800
things actually kick in because you know

1853
01:23:31,879 --> 01:23:34,849
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,469
this we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be something we</font>

1855
01:23:34,849 --> 01:23:37,789
can hire an executive director and we

1856
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:40,099
can do x and y and z and the money will

1857
01:23:37,789 --> 01:23:41,688
sort of fall from the sky well i'm a

1858
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:45,739
pessimist and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe money</font>

executive director position which to be

01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:05,749
honest is the single biggest liability

1866
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:08,449
the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> has almost everything</font>

1870
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:16,699
looking at the sponsorships from looking

1871

at the membership and looking at the

1872
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:20,419
conference attendees was in fact to

1873

assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers would actually</font>

1878
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:33,768
than this reality today when we put in

numbers for sponsorships they're

1880

actually worse than<font color="#CCCCCC"> this conference</font>

1881
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:40,820
today we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can actually do quite</font>

1882
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:43,308
a bit better through a few common sense

1883
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:45,829
things but but we try to be very

1884
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:46,789
disciplined and say well you know the

1885
01:24:45,829 --> 01:24:49,459
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the working group said we're</font>

1886
01:24:46,789 --> 01:24:51,289
not going to assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will be one</font>

percent more efficient we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1888
01:24:51,289 --> 01:24:57,050
assume that we are are better at selling

1889
01:24:54,159 --> 01:25:01,699
you know attendee spots or sponsors will

assume or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Worf's so between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that very</font>

generous alone coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin and by</font>

anyone would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look it's very very</font>

1895
01:25:09,139 --> 01:25:14,300
generous between that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and between the</font>

1896
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:16,518
extremely conservative assumptions we

1897
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:19,760
made we're pretty safe and the

1898
01:25:16,519 --> 01:25:22,789
assumptions are so conservative that in

1899
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:25,249
2011 and 2012 the the event actually

1900
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:27,469
runs of the event the organization

1901
01:25:25,249 --> 01:25:29,989
actually runs a hundred to two hundred

1902
01:25:27,469 --> 01:25:35,539
thousand dollar surplus that's how

1903
01:25:29,989 --> 01:25:38,089
conservative we were sir holy<font color="#E5E5E5"> holy</font>

1904
01:25:35,539 --> 01:25:41,380
Jacobson<font color="#CCCCCC"> let Cisco I think this is great</font>

1905
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:45,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the fact that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1906
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:46,340
sponsorship sort of regular eyes that

1907
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:50,420
what if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna call</font>

1908
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:51,500
that the one caveat I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> just warn you</font>

1909
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">about is that there are certain</font>

1910
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:59,389
organizations that are very very much

1911
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:02,330
like to host events in their hometown or

1912
01:25:59,389 --> 01:26:03,980
something like that this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

1913
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:05,119
we have any idea maybe since this is

1914
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,339
North America you won't have that

1915
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:11,570
problem but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to warn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you about it</font>

1916
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:13,010
it's it is an issue Chris casado who

1917
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:16,670
sadly could not be here for this meeting

1918
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:18,409
due to work reasons is pretty slick with

1919
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:20,630
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when he built the</font>

1920
01:26:18,409 --> 01:26:23,750
sponsorship model he made sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

1921
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:25,730
you wanted a particularly significant

1922
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:28,460
privilege of that sort that you're going

1923
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pay for it now he assumes he was</font>

1924
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:32,659
conservative in his assumptions that he

1925
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:35,360
assumed that no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> would pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it but</font>

1926
01:26:32,659 --> 01:26:38,269
if someone actually chooses to they'll

1927
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">be paying out the nose you know he also</font>

1928
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:43,159
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> the step of actually approaching</font>

1929
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:45,349
many of our current sponsors and asking

1930
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:47,000
them you know do you like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X or</font>

1931
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:48,440
do you like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like why you know how do</font>

1932
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,969
you want the sponsorship model to look

1933
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:52,669
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't say how much do you want to</font>

1934
01:26:49,969 --> 01:26:54,710
pay but he certainly said you know what

1935
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:56,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of structure do you prefer and how</font>

1936
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,670
far in advance do you want to know how

1937
01:26:56,179 --> 01:27:00,230
much things are in a cost and and you

1938
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:03,469
know so he got into a situation where

1939
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:05,598
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nana gets</font>

1940
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:08,960
what's left in company sponsorship

1941
01:27:05,599 --> 01:27:10,699
budgets because you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> venues</font>

1942
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,530
historically haven't been decided way in

1943
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:14,690
advance and because it's sort of

1944
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:17,150
non-standard it's not what event

1945
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:19,879
coordinators are used to seeing we get

1946
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:22,129
kind of leftovers but Chris really

1947
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:23,659
structured it so that these are now

1948
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:26,000
numbers that will be put in people's

1949
01:27:23,659 --> 01:27:28,969
budgets for planning purposes and I

1950
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,739
believe you know no data but I believe

1951
01:27:28,969 --> 01:27:32,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this will result in a lot more</font>

1952
01:27:30,739 --> 01:27:34,519
revenue for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization we did not</font>

1953
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:39,530
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that but it's a pretty</font>

1954
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:43,790
reasonable assumption yeah Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joseph</font>

1955
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:45,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google um in some nonprofits that I've</font>

1956
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:48,170
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with there's often</font>

1957
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:50,540
provisions to limit the signing

1958
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:52,520
authority of the executive and I assume

1959
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:54,110
I realize this may also border on

1960
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:57,710
governance but

1961
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:59,839
you're up there um so I assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1962
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:01,719
executive director would have primary

1963
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:05,030
signing Authority for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association</font>

1964
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:06,320
the concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have is if there I didn't</font>

1965
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,849
I skimmed over the bylaws I didn't

1966
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice any provisions that would limit</font>

1967
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:11,179
the amount of liability the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ED could</font>

1968
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:13,909
undertake on behalf of the organization

1969
01:28:11,179 --> 01:28:16,369
or the time time duration of such

1970
01:28:13,909 --> 01:28:19,159
liability but it's relatively unusual in

1971
01:28:16,369 --> 01:28:21,320
organization bylaws to put in financial

1972
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:24,099
controls those are normally maintained

1973
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:26,330
in a separate document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the the</font>

now that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done the budget the next</font>

1976
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:33,889
puzzle is definitely to write that

1977
01:28:30,469 --> 01:28:36,260
financial controls document and you know

1978
01:28:33,889 --> 01:28:37,730
I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> open to any input from anyone</font>

1979
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:39,590
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're going to do is look</font>

1980
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:41,718
at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our organizations and see</font>

1981
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:43,010
what they do certainly the executive

1982
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:45,860
director will have single signature

1989
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:02,630
you know that document has yet to be

1990

1992
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:07,909
best practices amongst nonprofits and go

01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:11,000
with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

1994
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:13,129
legally reviewed as well and I'm hoping

1995
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:19,159
I can jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line and answer that on</font>

1996
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:21,469
behalf of the bylaws the intent in the

1997
01:29:19,159 --> 01:29:23,150
bylaws on that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the language</font>

1998
01:29:21,469 --> 01:29:24,590
in front of me and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we were</font>

1999
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:27,110
pretty vague on it but certainly the

2000
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:29,179
intent was that final authority on

2001
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:31,670
everything was with the board and that

2002
01:29:29,179 --> 01:29:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the board would presumably decide what</font>

2003
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:39,739
those limits are those type of limits

2004

are even if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put them in the bylaws</font>

2010

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to quit those limits in but</font>

effectively the money required for

executive director and benefits each

2034

quarterly payment is contingent upon a

respectable financial controls because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the controls are very reasonable</font>

audited financial statements which it's

all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should be doing</font>

anyway I apologize this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so small this</font>

01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:58,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">is why you didn't do this in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

place this is the era note amortization

2055
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:05,020
table but suffice to say they're giving

us a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good deal Pat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> venuto</font>

cash-strapped student one of the things

2058
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:11,849
that it occurs to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

2059
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:13,530
that the membership as it exists is very

01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:15,780
much not nailed down<font color="#CCCCCC"> benefits something</font>

2061
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:17,820
else and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I don't spend money</font>

2062
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:19,370
unless I have a reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the only thing</font>

01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:22,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">advised</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me the vote at the moment I</font>

2065
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:26,220
etc etc but from the immediate

2066
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:27,870
short-term perspective that's all advise

2067
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:29,790
me as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> result of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which I'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unlikely</font>

2068
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:31,610
to spend that money so curious how much

2069
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:33,990
the budget depended on people actually

2070
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:36,420
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the membership</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brushes etc</font>

2071
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:39,059
first I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say you should not</font>

2072
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:41,010
become a member but no because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

2073
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the calculus you do they didn't know</font>

2074
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:45,060
then you've made the right choice which

2075
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:46,950
is that you know if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font>

2076
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:49,140
looking at this as a student or someone

2077
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:52,110
says you know is is it worth it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend</font>

2078
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:55,170
under dollars a year for a vote that's

2079
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:57,360
not a good deal if you're someone who's

2080
01:32:55,170 --> 01:33:00,180
very interested in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future of the</font>

2081
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:02,940
organization then it's it's a perfectly

2082
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:04,470
reasonable investment but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

2083
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,320
you know part of the reason for having

2084
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:09,090
is so that it's not just whoever it

2085
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:11,130
happens to go to a conference once in a

2086
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:12,450
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and then decides that they</font>

2087
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:14,040
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like voting for something they know</font>

2088
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:16,440
nothing about it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

2089
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:18,600
help people sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> self select so ever</font>

2090
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,429
feel strongly about it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

2091
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,800
they they have the support developer

2092
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:25,500
conference or not can do it what we

2093
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:28,170
assumed were<font color="#CCCCCC"> a relatively low number of</font>

2094
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:30,510
attendees her pardon me a relatively low

2095
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:34,710
number of members I think it maxes out

2096
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:37,380
it's somewhere around 250 and 2012 and

2097
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:39,300
initially is somewhere around 100 so

2098
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:41,100
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talking that we need thousands</font>

2099
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:42,810
of members the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial numbers are very</font>

2100
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:44,190
hot and this is part of the iterative

2101
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:45,570
process we did when we created the

2102
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:47,940
budget I think the initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> number is</font>

2103
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:49,769
like 1300 members and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that back</font>

2104
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:51,570
and they you know the membership group

2105
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:53,730
thought about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the end</font>

2106
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:56,340
of the day you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were talking sort</font>

2107
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:58,589
of very low hundreds and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

2108
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:59,670
you know in steady state in a couple of

<font color="#E5E5E5">years that's actually a pretty</font>

2110
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:04,500
reasonable number to have when you look

2111

at the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks who come here and</font>

2120
01:34:18,059 --> 01:34:24,599
who've just gotten off those groups and

2121
01:34:21,089 --> 01:34:26,639
are being rehabilitated so that they can

2122
01:34:24,599 --> 01:34:28,559
reenter society you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

2125
01:34:30,839 --> 01:34:35,459
about people who sort of don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time</font>

2126
01:34:32,669 --> 01:34:38,010
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a job but I the numbers are</font>

2127
01:34:35,459 --> 01:34:39,510
anything small and reasonable and you

2128
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:40,649
know not expecting that everyone who

2129
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:45,389
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a conference like this would</font>

2130
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:48,869
want to do it exactly the opposite yeah

2131
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:51,689
I can certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull them up sit Pope</font>

2132
01:34:48,869 --> 01:34:55,049
yes in disguise that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real eye</font>

2133
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:58,619
test from Joe and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

2134
01:34:55,050 --> 01:35:04,589
first year so 2011 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumption is</font>

2135
01:34:58,619 --> 01:35:10,228
only for a hundred members 2011 155 2012

2136
01:35:04,589 --> 01:35:14,729
250 and 2013 500 so it's very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

2137
01:35:10,229 --> 01:35:18,209
in terms of budget contribution not to

2138
01:35:14,729 --> 01:35:19,589
interject and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set up here</font>

2139
01:35:18,209 --> 01:35:21,030
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's done but just so</font>

2140
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:22,530
everybody knows the social started<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

2141
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:25,108
minutes ago so if you have a comment

2142
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:26,219
please come up and I know I'll sit here

2143
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:28,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I bet the rest of these guys are</font>

2144
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:30,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">dedicated enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so but just want</font>

2145
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:32,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to let you know in case somebody was</font>

2146
01:35:30,059 --> 01:35:33,569
hoping to get free alcohol yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

2147
01:35:32,129 --> 01:35:36,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">the budget by the way we only counted on</font>

2148
01:35:33,569 --> 01:35:39,239
250 members<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead he's dead so very</font>

2149
01:35:36,359 --> 01:35:41,669
small history yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an observation</font>

2150
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:43,978
we did have a student<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve on the</font>

2151
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:46,769
program committee so there are certainly

2152
01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:49,679
people who are likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in the student</font>

2153
01:35:46,769 --> 01:35:51,869
role actually participate in both

2154
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:53,760
governance voting and so on thank you

2155
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:55,799
yeah and that's something to think about

2156
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:59,129
when you guys are some of folks here

2157
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:01,949
throwing stones at membership you know a

2158
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:03,239
lot of students<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't afford what the</font>

2159
01:36:01,949 --> 01:36:05,579
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us might afford when we were</font>

2160
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:07,759
working so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sense in having</font>

2161
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:09,929
a sharply discounted student membership

2162
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,059
you know if you're you're Joe grad

2163
01:36:09,929 --> 01:36:14,159
student a hundred dollars is a lot

2164
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:15,719
having been Joe grad student you know

2165
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:19,638
twenty dollars might be a little more

2166
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:19,639
reasonable so something to think about

2167
01:36:19,669 --> 01:36:24,358
yeah we cut you off sorry no i don't i

2168
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,249
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really care if they can</font>

2169
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:28,819
afford it or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to incentivize</font>

2170
01:36:26,249 --> 01:36:28,818
them to participate

2171
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:37,790
yeah c-can we also get some b2b

2172
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">e-business synergies he's gonna punch me</font>

2173
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:53,840
any other questions comments right thank

2174
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:57,950
you very much yeah thanks now that's it

2175
01:36:53,840 --> 01:37:00,380
I age I I had one question that wasn't

2176
01:36:57,950 --> 01:37:01,700
budget-related it was by laws related to

2177
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:04,430
the actually election for the bylaws

2178
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:08,510
this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to ask yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hi</font>

2179
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:11,000
odd<font color="#CCCCCC"> Donny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roizman here the devote were</font>

2180
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:13,580
that we have in front of us is adopting

2181
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,760
the bylaws in full there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I stumble</font>

2182
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:18,890
across one error and I was wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

2183
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:20,720
soon will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be looking at correcting them</font>

2184
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:22,400
air for example in section<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine when it</font>

2185
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:25,340
talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the committee's section nine</font>

2186
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:26,710
lists<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> committees at the intro but</font>

2187
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:29,060
then actually details five committees

2188
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:30,160
throughout the rest of section 9 so how

2189
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:34,790
would we<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with something like that</font>

2190
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:35,900
well there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few choices one thing</font>

2191
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:38,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we'll need to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look and decide</font>

2192
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:41,389
what's controlling in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect it</font>

2193
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:44,060
would be the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> enumerated list that's</font>

2194
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:46,400
opposed to the introduction but that's

2195
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:47,840
without looking at it we have two

2196
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:50,349
mechanisms to fix things<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're</font>

2197
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:52,370
wrong one of them is as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pointed out</font>

2198
01:37:50,350 --> 01:37:54,620
the board does have power to make

2199
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:56,990
emergency changes unanimous vote with

2200
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:58,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">freight very limitations like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

2201
01:37:56,990 --> 01:38:01,790
invite to change the way we're about to

2202
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:03,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">it or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in order to</font>

2203
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:05,360
give ourselves life memberships anything

2204
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:06,890
like that so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one option of the</font>

2205
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:08,299
other alternative is to wait the year

2206
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:10,820
and put it through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal amendment</font>

2207
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:15,110
process so it would depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

2208
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:16,370
severity of the error and how obvious a

2209
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:22,670
fix it is and whether this community

2210
01:38:16,370 --> 01:38:25,400
support for it i think they any other

2211
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:28,190
question just one last note when the

2212
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">charter came out in 2005 there were at</font>

2213
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:32,929
least as many errors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thats one</font>

2214
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:35,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who wrote it it was rife</font>

2215
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:37,610
with mistakes and over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next 24</font>

2216
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:40,370
months we fixed it no matter how perfect

2217
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:41,790
people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is there are a whole</font>

2218
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:44,490
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we will</font>

2219
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:45,810
cover in any document like this that not

2220
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:47,639
six or nine months from now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll put</font>

2221
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:49,920
ourselves in the head<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go wow how</font>

2222
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:53,130
stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were that's like</font>

2223
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,900
the biggest mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've ever seen any</font>

2224
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:57,030
mistakes you you think you see now are

2225
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:59,549
easy to fix but really there's going to

2226
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:00,840
be a big round of fixes in in about six

2227
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:02,730
months just because there are merchant

2228
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:08,010
properties that we have no way of

2229
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:11,750
understanding any other questions or

2230
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:15,180
comments or rotten tomatoes or right

2231

2237
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:35,600
my advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to vote YES on the Charter</font>

and wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>
