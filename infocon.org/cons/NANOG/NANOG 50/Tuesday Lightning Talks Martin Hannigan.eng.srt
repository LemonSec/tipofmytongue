oh that's a problem okay is it as the

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">other spreadsheets up in the website so</font>

don't believe it okay you can leave

today addresses are really cheap you can

get addresses from our IRS you jut you

at what the cost of a and the

there actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been attempted</font>

77
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,230
markets and actually some successful

78
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,230
transactions the market cost of an IP

79
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,750
address now as gauged by some of those

80
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,780
absorbed transactions is about four

81
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,280
dollars increase over your current<font color="#CCCCCC"> RA</font>

82
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,040
our cost is two hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sixty-three</font>

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,168
percent that's fairly steep even at a

84
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,399
dollar fifty two in a dress and it only

85
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:22,900
goes up and gets worse from them d for

86
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,820
depletion when we actually get their

87
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,409
traditional channels have access to

88
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,380
address space are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone I</font>

89
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,960
mean you'll still have the ability to

90
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,570
access like austerity purple austerity

91
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,460
policy and transition pools and whatnot

92
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,349
at our arrows but it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

93
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,120
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get adequate amounts</font>

94
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,699
adequate amounts of address space from

95
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,800
those pools at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

96
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,139
the cost of an IP address at depletion

97
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,580
will be unknown it's very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

98
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,100
plan when you have unknown variables

99
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,349
especially with<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

100
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,289
your network your caution and your cogs

101
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,270
overall is unknown again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

102
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">very scared and you should take some of</font>

103
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,169
these points back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your your bean</font>

104
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:06,210
counters and your sea level folks and

105
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:09,490
tell them how scared you are so I

106
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,799
basically took any / 8 and D aggregated

107
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,330
it and built some built a table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,220
and in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know what a dollar</font>

109
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,820
as I spread<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the five top</font>

110
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:23,169
currencies euro sterling wand yen

111
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,419
dollars I in the cost per dollar all in

112
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,099
the dollar cost I basically use the four

113
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,349
dollar number which in my opinion is

114
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:31,180
extremely conservative we've observed

115
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,280
some ebay transactions which were

116
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,169
significantly more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than four dollars but</font>

117
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can't actually give you a reference to</font>

118
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,310
those transactions because when ebay

119
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,690
takes down an auction they delete all

120
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,660
traces of it it comes up and says

121
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,789
invalid the last information point I had

122
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,500
with relation to ebay auctions in the

123
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,440
cost of IP address space was forty

124
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,190
dollars now that's forty dollars per

125
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,900
address and that's before the

126
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,740
got to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 60 seconds which is</font>

127
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">where all the pricing action happens so</font>

128
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,630
that's pretty scary that ebay will kill

129
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,000
an auction<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we we have a reference</font>

130
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,159
point that a single size 32 is at forty

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,140
dollars and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it never made it to the</font>

132
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,600
clothes who knows what it would have

133
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,849
been up to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> who knows if that person</font>

134
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,590
wasn't astroturf ring and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bidden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bidding</font>

135
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,030
against himself i don't really know a

136
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,229
lot of weird things seem to be happening

137
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,580
with respect to IP address space but if

138
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,190
i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> open the spreadsheet we're going</font>

139
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,840
to do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of cost modeling so</font>

140
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,880
some of the questions that you may have

141
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,530
well what business model works for

142
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,200
acquisition so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to</font>

143
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">have IP address space hopefully ar ar</font>

144
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,800
austerity and transition policy will

145
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,180

this up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spreadsheet before I</font>

206
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:59,910
bring it up on the slide and I was

thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do i how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I continue this</font>

discussion outside of the meeting and

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,330
one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

210
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,709
was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we do have excel okay so</font>

211
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,060
this is the spreadsheet and you'll be

212
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,650
able to retrieve this<font color="#E5E5E5"> off of an in our</font>

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,930
website so you can play with the dollar

cap cost is cast cost of capital

216
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,290
generally when you spend money there's a

217
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,970
cost to spending that money I don't know

218
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,040
how IP addresses are going to be

219

accounted<font color="#CCCCCC"> for so when you buy something</font>

or you Lisa it or you rent it or you

221
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,969
make a deal to have some action happen

222
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,410
that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be accounted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's these are</font>

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some capital expenditure or</font>

224
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,140
you know an operational expense and they

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,460
they go in different<font color="#CCCCCC"> places in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

227
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">too too far into that but I don't know</font>

228
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,460
how this is going to be accounted for

229
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,040
but there's less absolutely going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

230
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:57,800
a cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of capital so if you are if you</font>

go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in context which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

so if you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this chart in sorry</font>

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:14,320
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Windows user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

235
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,820
look at the / 8 and then go directly to

236
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and look at the value of that</font>

237
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:26,290
/ 8 at four dollars that's real money if

238
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:28,599
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you had that cost and again</font>

239
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,519
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really talking about a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

240
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,290
model I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that'll be left up up</font>

241
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,700
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have that</font>

242
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,170
cost that's significant amount of money

243
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,329
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to come off of some</font>

244
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,939
portion of your revenue be applied to

245
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:42,640
some expense over some term if you're

246
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,190
going to acquire something like a / 24

247
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,140
for example at four dollars it's only a

248
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,959
thousand twenty four dollars but at a

249
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,699
hundred it's much more expensive I think

250
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,899
100 is actually fairly realistic and

251
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,630
i've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been using a thousand as an</font>

252
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,010
amplifier not so sure that's unrealistic

253
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,029
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have anything to really back</font>

254
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,800
that up right now but that so getting my

255
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:04,930
point is it costs money to spend money

256
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
your money if you can't spend your money

257
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,779
because it's tied up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

258
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,269
expense over a period it costs you money

259
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:16,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so back to the spreadsheet not</font>

260
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:18,420
Tom's thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright let me get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
