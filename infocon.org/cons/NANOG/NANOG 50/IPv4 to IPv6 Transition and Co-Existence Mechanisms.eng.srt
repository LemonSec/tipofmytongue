00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,619
there's some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those fabulous</font>

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,660
Apple TV's so fill out your survey so

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,330
this morning we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna we have two</font>

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,490
panels lined up for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,940
this is the joint part of the air and

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">nanog meeting so we're trying to talk</font>

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,640
first about mechanisms and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:31,679
experiences with deploying v6 and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:36,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hand it over to Lee Howard good</font>

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,120
morning you have slides for me the

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,440
shared addressing issues slides but

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
while you bring those up I'll do some

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,430
introductions my name is Lee Howard I

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,468
work for Time Warner Cable and I also

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,850
serve on the air and board of trustees I

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,120
hope you'll recognize my name when you

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">vote later this week I have a put</font>

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,680
together a panel of people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,760
transition planning what to do as you

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,670
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle the the the</font>

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,860
run out of ipv4 available address pool

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,110
and there are a variety of things that

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,470
we can do about it so what you do

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,939
depends on what your requirements are

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,010
and so we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together and i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

26
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,750
introduce them quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have Jason</font>

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,630
while who's going to talk about NAT for

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,130
for large-scale Nats I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> yuly who's</font>

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,880
excellent experience with six rd and is

41
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,619
able to share that with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us because I</font>

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we all need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see again what the</font>

43
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,030
considerations are for various training

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,939
training possibilities so thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very</font>

45
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">much if you don't have slides I can</font>

46
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,110
bring my laptop up but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,110
one I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

48
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,700
No

49
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,069
that's yours I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for mine cuz i</font>

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,760
had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides to talk about</font>

51
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,760
general issues

52
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,160
I apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it is still</font>

53
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,730
apparently early in the morning on the

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,340
third day of nano so I have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

55
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,290
cartoon that i use to show executives

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,540
what carrier-grade NAT<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what address</font>

57
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,190
sharing looks like so here we have a

58
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,470
typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> network with some mats that have</font>

59
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,050
been injected into the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

60
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,450
large ISP and a packet is an identifier

61
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,250
and it has a name attached to it and if

62
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,530
you change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that packet at</font>

63
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,940
multiple points along the path then by

64
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,280
the time the packet gets to its

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,770
destination you have no idea what that

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,970
packets name was so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

67
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,070
that's the fun version for your

68
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,870
executives but here's a slightly more

69
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,940
technical version most people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

70
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,290
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this already this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,510
got to source address in a destination

72
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,459
address you set up a mapping in each

73
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,799
device along the path that's doing

74
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,930
address translation and change the

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,170
packet header along as you're doing that

76
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,940
translation so what that means is when

77
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,559
you have shared addresses many people

78
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,250
are going to be using the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

79
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">address so if you have if somebody comes</font>

80
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,350
to you as a network operator and says

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,950
who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> using address 192 dot 0 dot to</font>

82
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">that 117 at a given time your response</font>

83
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,488
is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

84
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,070
thousands of people were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

85
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,720
address at that time so you have to use

86
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,920
the operator running this address

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,630
sharing mechanism whether it's

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,410
carrier-grade NAT or dual stack light or

89
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:13,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have to say I'm sorry FBI</font>

90
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:16,440
or RCMP or<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPAA your subpoena is overly</font>

91
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,270
broad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm unable to respond and it turns</font>

92
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,760
out that so part of the issue here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

93
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that of course is used in the home very</font>

94
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,390
commonly all the time everybody has an

95
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,130
that in their home all right maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

96
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:30,300
everybody here many people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT in</font>

97
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,310
their home but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FBI is looking</font>

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,700
for when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they serve a subpoena is which</font>

99
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,590
door to kick down and if you say there

100
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,419
are a thousand doors behind which that

101
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,960
address might be used that's that's of

102
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:45,539
no use to them whatsoever so it gets a

103
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,669
little bit worse if you have a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

104
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,250
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> none of my users would attack</font>

105
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:52,020
any of your users but if you had a user

106
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,270
on your network who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing something</font>

107
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,909
malicious and somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> needed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report</font>

108
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,299
that abuse

109
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,670
then the the abuse report is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

110
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,510
to contain sufficient detail to identify

111
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:06,970
the bad guy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically web logs mail</font>

112
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:10,390
server logs don't track the source port

113
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,150
and maybe your time stamp is reliable

114
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,289
maybe your ntp source is good and maybe

115
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:19,599
you're telling me whether you're using

116
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:21,280
UTC gmt or EDT but maybe not and so just

117
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,710
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds of slip depending on your</font>

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,979
address sharing settings could really

119
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,599
cause problems and then the somebody

120
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,940
goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect their network and black</font>

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,100
holes thousands of users if you're a

122
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,780
content provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're black holing</font>

123
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,070
thousands of people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

125
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:42,370
attacked you that's potentially very

126
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,110
problematic so in a situation that i

127
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,780
like to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> nat four four four four</font>

128
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">four because that's how many times it</font>

129
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:55,270
gets translated the the user on one side

<font color="#CCCCCC">a tracker server maybe a game consoles</font>

using somebodys game system live and

138
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,599
goes to the tracker server and says

connection the IP address it sees is

144
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,140
maybe the actual IP address of

sharing addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes security hard</font>

this particular case subpoena response

216
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,430
sharing addresses break some

217

applications and maybe some people's

218
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,630

i like to call service provider nap 44

257
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,839
terms already some of those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure</font>

258
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:09,810
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard and impress and from</font>

259
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,209
vendors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's nat 444</font>

260
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,699
which is so much confusing because our

261
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:16,709
there's basically it's natural for and

262
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,600
the service provider but this implies

263
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,000
that there's another layer of natural

264
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,320
for somewhere else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright i can see</font>

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,990
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> some confusion in that</font>

266
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,310
terminology<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large scale on that became</font>

267
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,260
pretty popular as well as carrier-grade

268
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,880
NAT I guess carrier green I had some

269
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,970
negative connotations in some

270
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,670
communities so the opted for<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale</font>

271
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,890
that now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'msorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on yet another one</font>

272
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,750
called service provider net SP nap 44

273
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,860
because in reality we're actually doing

274
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:46,680
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat 44 somewhere within the end</font>

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,560
service provider internal network so let

276
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,540
start out comparing a residential<font color="#E5E5E5"> nap</font>

277
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,589
for four verses service provider nap<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

278
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">four because it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really for me this is a</font>

279
00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:00,290
festa to the to nap versions I'm dealing

280
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,670
with leasing the access provider network

281
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,680
so on the residential side you have

282
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,899
basically natural for disbanded by the

283
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,140
home gateway and then is serving

284

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:26,790
168 that slashed 16 block or the 10 / 8

290
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:29,690
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little less common but more</font>

291
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,920
problematic because I'll get to later

292
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,420
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key differentiators fear</font>

293
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,969
between service fried or net and

294
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:39,329
residential net is that the current

295
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,100
mapping for the public IP space to the

296
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:43,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">home network as one to one so you have</font>

297
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,640
one well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have one eye piece one</font>

298
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,100
public IP

299
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,600
presents one household so to

300
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,110
differentiate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and service fighter</font>

301
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,440
NAT you have now a mapping of one IP

302
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:58,140
public to multiple households private

303
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,430
and then there's multiple layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

304
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,189
that's where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your second layer</font>

305
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,709
of net behind there the other big

306
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:07,530
challenge here is with a standard

307
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,630
residential now<font color="#CCCCCC"> for four you have the</font>

308
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:13,140
full address the full port range all 16

309
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:15,410
bits to use of 65,000 plus ports and you

310
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:21,090
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like port forwarding and</font>

311
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:23,250
upnp they actually utilize static ports

312
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,810
within that range with the service

313
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,290
provider net you lose that option and

314
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:30,750
now you're sharing the portability bit

315
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,920
portability amongst multiple households

316
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:36,840
which which adds a layer of complexity

317
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,060
the other issue here is what address

318
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:43,200
range to use within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider</font>

319
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:46,250
at RFC 1918 is possible but there's also

320
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,920
other options<font color="#E5E5E5"> like shared provider space</font>

321
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,150
here's a nice diagram that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I barred from</font>

322
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,790

323

324
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,969
those basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just talked about</font>

325
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,430
before you have the orange layer of

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,470
private IP address space which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

and then on the bottom there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,850
your standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> residential nad and grey</font>

341

deploying this in networks these are the

two that I've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with the current</font>

348
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,650

349
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,240
well as the residential network<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

350
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,250
all traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the net you</font>

351
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,020

353
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,699
within within the box itself but

354
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
it does represent a single point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

355
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,300
failure the other option i like to call

356
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,030
an ad on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stick where you actually</font>

357
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,520
sticking in that off of your service

358
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,280
aggregation layer routers and then using

359
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">a source based IP routing to get traffic</font>

360
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,829
to that and then there's nice default

361
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:18,860
out back to your standard aggregation

362
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:22,130
router lots of deployment<font color="#E5E5E5"> considerations</font>

363
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to consider first off is just the how to</font>

364
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,380
scale the box itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously there's</font>

365
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,120
two big factors here is a capacity how

366
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,550
much let me think of the average

367
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer you know a peak time using</font>

368
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,420
possibly mega<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if you put a few</font>

369
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,300
thousand customers behind that that's a

370
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:41,300
good deal of traffic well into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that box</font>

371
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,130
the other issue is number of the memory

372
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,630
requirements on that box based on the

373
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,370
number of concurrent sessions you need

374
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,230
to keep open as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the number of</font>

375
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:52,190
new sessions you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open up at any</font>

376
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,600
given second bigger issue well so that's

377
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,240
that's fairly doable standard

378
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,070
architecture design there the bigger

379
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,470
challenge here is the logging which is

380
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,930
some of the I'll reference some of the

381
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,940
work Lee did but the challenges from the

382
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:09,050
law enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> side we actually have to</font>

383
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,940
maintain a mapping of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public IP to</font>

384
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,310
the private IP which means we need to

385
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:17,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">log a heck of a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of state information</font>

386
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,400
in that box so doing this when you're

387
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,439
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know possibly putting</font>

388
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,350
30 40 gigs room of these boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot</font>

389
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,670
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> state to maintain so it would be it's</font>

390
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,350
some interesting considerations and

391
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,430
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a giraffe and I ATF</font>

392
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,390
that's talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of this as</font>

393
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:34,760
well of how to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it and then</font>

394
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,560
the benefits of service provider nap

395
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,010
versus some of the other ones we'll talk

396
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,719
about today is that a NAT<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very well</font>

397
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,240
understood at least not for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for is very</font>

398
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,980
well understood it's been in use for

399
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,200
what eight ninety years at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

400
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">within my home so I'm pretty comfortable</font>

401
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,630
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it works it's also does not</font>

402
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">require this is the biggest issue for me</font>

403
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:59,420
is it doesn't require<font color="#E5E5E5"> the replacement of</font>

404
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> home gateway router so for our lease</font>

405
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,689
on the standard cable deployment today

406
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,928
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do we don't actually</font>

407
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,579
offer well we offer the the home gateway

408
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:09,949
now but it's not an option that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

409
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,569
customers use so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the common</font>

410
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,750
scenario

411
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:15,220
probably say 80-plus percent of homes as

412
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,289
they'll get our service you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a layer</font>

414

in their home gateway so those boxes

415
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,339
today aren't going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support v6 so I</font>

00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:58,719
that the whole mapping of multiple homes

432
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,580
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to thousands of</font>

433
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,230
homes to one IP causes all kinds of

434
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:06,750
challenges for law enforcement security

435
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,679
and spam blacklisting whitelisting

436
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,279
that's gonna be it's gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

437
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,389
issue going forward especially I know

438
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,190
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> the law enforcement is</font>

439
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:19,990
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is all right now I need</font>

440
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:22,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">to know how to map up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well I have a SMS</font>

441
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,309
spam<font color="#E5E5E5"> me or there's a motion picture</font>

442
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,990
issue you know somebody's using

443
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:27,759
copyrighted content they shouldn't be

444
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">but are coming from this IP address well</font>

445
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,850
that's not going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> because now</font>

446
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:34,080
that represents a whole neighborhood or

447
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:36,939
a small city so now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to add more</font>

448
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,840
it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to to that</font>

449
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:44,320
collection effort there's an address

450
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,480
conflict issue here between if so you

451
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,580
could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> RC 1918 space on that service</font>

452
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,100
for Ryder realm the problem here is if

453
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,439
the home resident the residential that

454
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,149
uses that same space you hit now have an

455
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,279
address conflict that's that's somewhat

456
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:58,959
challenging to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work through so there are</font>

457
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> options</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there of how we can</font>

458
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,600
alleviate this actually have a draft I'm

459
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:08,919
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on another panel and</font>

460
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:11,230
then there's a NT t shirts hockey draft

461
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,110
is a similar proposal but we'll talk

462
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,759
about that later it does break upnp

463
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,120
deployments so obviously a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

464
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:23,019
home game console gaming consoles use

465
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,129
this so that's a problem ps3 I know is a

466
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:25,840
good one that breaks pretty

467
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,120
well behind these devices and we

468
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,020
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done some some testing</font>

469
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,750
labs to show what works and what doesn't

470
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:38,860
there are ways around this the the the

471
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,750
upnp form is looking to extend in their

472
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">next option to support some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

473
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,000
often some of this new functionality I

474
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,340
get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it that so and there are</font>

475
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,600
port mapping protocols a few options<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

476
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,530
the IETF works under way as well

477
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,179
obviously there's a reduction in

478
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,250
resiliency you now have a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

479
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,300
of failure which is uncommon and most

480
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,880
service provider network sure you

481
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,830
typically have multiple multiple boxes

482
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,290
serving as backup so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

483
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,780
and then the security considerations

484
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've already talked about all right</font>

485
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,690
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> two use cases here for this</font>

486
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,870
deployment getting close all right re

487
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,370
are so the assumptions here basic rars

488
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,949
are out of space we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no more ipv4</font>

489
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,689
address space we're actually deploying

490
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,490
v6 I think everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to is going</font>

491
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> V 6</font>

492
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,080
plus V for deployment but you need a way

493
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:32,800
to extend your v4 address space so use

494
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:35,350
case one is a single stack ipv4 so the

495
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,490
scenario here is either like i was

496
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,139
saying you have a home gateways they're

497
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,460
going to be v4 only so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do</font>

498
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,380
something until they you can either

499
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,260
replace that yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> really where the</font>

500
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:48,340
customer replaces it so you can support

501
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:51,490
v6 to the home or the other one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> via</font>

502
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,679
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> provider network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> segment so we have</font>

503
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,420
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge on in some portions of the</font>

504
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,610
network or device access devices don't

505
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">support v6 today they will in the near</font>

506
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,770
future so you need some interim ability

507
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,510
to continue supporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> between when you</font>

508
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,250
run out when you can support me<font color="#CCCCCC"> six on</font>

509
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,220
those devices so these are going to be

510
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:12,070
small segmented deployments the second

511
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:16,270
the use case is dual stack native<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

512
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:18,490
plus ipv4 what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does supports the</font>

513
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,010
use case of customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have v4 only</font>

514
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices such as their large televisions</font>

515
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,129
that are not going to replace<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat day</font>

516
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,679
soon but they still want to get Netflix

517
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,930
Hulu you know what Pandora<font color="#CCCCCC"> streamed to</font>

518
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,060
that television obviously we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

519
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,800
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and just not not kill it</font>

520
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,470
with this device so or not kill it with

521
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,580
ipv6 deployment so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

522
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,580
use case for that scenario

523
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,320
so conclusions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that a service</font>

524
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,190
provider nap definitely being deployed

525
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,960
hopefully it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be deployed in small</font>

526
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:51,200
segments here and there where needed and

527
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,080
only as a interim device to get you to

528
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,240
where you're having v6 native and

529
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,629
migrating auto v for customers to v6 as

530
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,370
quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible preferred apology</font>

531
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,500
for me is now on a stick so it gets the

532
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,689
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> box the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box out of line so that that</font>

533
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,100
box does fail it's not going to take

534
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:12,080
down any of your standard traffic and

535
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,639
then obviously we have some challenges

536
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,668
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shared a dressing mile that</font>

537
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll talk about later on and that's</font>

538
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:33,740
good oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll save some time hey come on</font>

539
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,419
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys my name is Judy from comcast so</font>

540
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:43,400

542
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the company asked me to put it so</font>

543
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is i'm going</font>

544
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you guys a beef over wheel for</font>

545
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,199
the transition technology and then the

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,669
translation technologies called<font color="#CCCCCC"> es light</font>

547
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,679
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Charlie sanitized I mean</font>

548
00:22:55,669 --> 00:23:01,490
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already in the working group last</font>

549
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,690
call is this now in the alley s3 the

550
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,280
peace vision also<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you some tests</font>

551
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,100
without you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys also interested how</font>

552
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,750
these tellers you work in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> labs and</font>

553
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,730
the goal here is try to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

554
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,679
some general understanding how this

555
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,630
televisual and how you can deploy in

556
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,480
your network and the claimer here is we

557
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:20,090
heavily investigating the technology but

558
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:24,679
we are not committing to deploy for the

559
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:27,110
time being so over wheel so basically

560
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,150
dsi is a transition technology it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

561
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dual stack to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the users at</font>

562
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,350
home and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then try to give</font>

563
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,150
a deuce that environment to the user at

564
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:40,309
home but we are not giving the user a

565
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:43,700
real public<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 address so are similar</font>

566
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:46,340
to autumn in a Jason and Lee design we

567
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,620
have a nap in the network but we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

568
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,119
doing a double knot in this case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

569
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,728
basically saying is we have

tunnel from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the home gateway to the</font>

00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:02,329
do incremental upgrade for the ipv6

574
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:03,829
because now you really have you have

575
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:05,569
intention I mean you have a motivation

576
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:10,099
to deploy ipv6 because now you can save

577
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:12,619
to ipv4 address very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

579
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:17,569
like you give a lady<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ipv6 to the home</font>

580
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:20,749
and you will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage the users</font>

581
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:22,819
and applications to go up in 60 this is

582
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:24,919
not a technology to<font color="#E5E5E5"> design the people to</font>

583
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:27,229
prolong IP before it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically</font>

584
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,259
give you a transition technology so

585
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:33,169
while you deploy ipv6 and we can provide

586
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:38,839
we can provide the ipv4 service

587
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:40,399
continuity to your home user and because

588
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,168
in the end deploying a net in the

589
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,639
network has<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's a cost associated</font>

592
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,589

594
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:56,029
when the cpu received three four packets

network users pack you just basically

597
00:24:57,439 --> 00:25:02,449
encapsulate the packet into a dress and

598
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,849
then ship<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to their home get to care</font>

600
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:07,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">in matter so basically you're just</font>

00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:10,719
pushing the nap on home to the service

602

technology and transition technologies

609
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:27,379
even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cording</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is transition</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it is actually turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no in the packet so</font>

613
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,719
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big different is the network is not</font>

614
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:37,248
touching the IP header instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

encapsulate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> D capture the packet</font>

616
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:41,239
normally when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do translation left</font>

less<font color="#CCCCCC"> Expo and f 46 you actually</font>

618
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:47,899
manipulating IP addresses so this is

619
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:50,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the diagram very high level how it</font>

620
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:53,748
works so the purple color is seduced

621
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:56,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we expect the network will be dual</font>

622
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:59,089
stack we also expect the home user at

623
00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:02,299
home will be dual stack the green color

624
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:03,470
meaning is only be six so the CP is only

625
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,049
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in v6 and you</font>

626
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,360
queer dunno which is yellow color<font color="#CCCCCC"> to can</font>

627
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:10,460
capture the packet into the tunnel

628
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,959
endpoint and then the tunnel endpoint

629
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,799
and the net we become one box called

630
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,480
AAPL<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just translate I just family</font>

631
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,960
translation rather which will do both

632
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,299
the tunnel termination and the net for

633
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,890
for functionality so you combine two

634
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:28,039
functioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one because we need the</font>

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net table so I have the net table</font>

637
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,610
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you would just do a simple</font>

638
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,500
translation from the inside address

639
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,049

642
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,570

net to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and you're one in</font>

644
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:50,120
ipv6 and because you have ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> SS never</font>

645
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,309
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point you can delegate a prefix</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to the home gateway and the home gateway</font>

647
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:56,899
will give lady 36 to the cpe if your CP

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right not CPM in your host if</font>

649
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,610
your host is still star then you have a

650
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,260
v6 address and you if you do a you enjoy

651
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,820
to which v6 later site and you will

652
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,620
bypass all this infrastructure and then

653
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:11,570
too lazy to delay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be 6 all the way to</font>

654
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:13,610
the destination so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason already</font>

655
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,990
give us some<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wheeldon fo for for so</font>

I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeat it but I want to</font>

657
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,740
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys some comparison between</font>

658
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,100
these two technologies you mean they are

659
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,539
they have their feet they have some

660
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,610
similar characteristics but they also

661
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:28,640
have some different characteristics so

662
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,979
Knepper for for the major<font color="#E5E5E5"> languages you</font>

663
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,380
don't need to change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway but the</font>

664
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,789
s like you have to because now you don't

665
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,110
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the network you at you</font>

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:41,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually create a tunnel from the cpg to</font>

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:44,000
the network and the net for 44 in theory

668
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:46,039
you just if you only consider that for

669

VIP before you don't have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it never</font>

671
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,980
because this is the number one priority

672
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:53,418
we want to give v6 as assessed network

673
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,270
to create a tunnel so that we preserve

674
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:57,830
the wii for dresses an fo fo-fo there is

675
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,750
no encapsulation over here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a simple net and there's light</font>

677
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,679
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are doing an capsulation so</font>

678
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,270
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> empty you make holes that</font>

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you issue in some of those in some of</font>

680
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,658
the system so you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider if</font>

681
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,970
you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extra 40 bytes in the</font>

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,260
double nap and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dsl is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not because you</font>

687
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:25,990
and that 444 in theory you can you only

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:28,280
can support ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology and</font>

689
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,080
dsi is now because they want you will

690
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:34,040
have lady I native ipv6 so you can

691
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,929
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> both ipv4 and ipv6 if you your</font>

692
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,060
network is big enough a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pan</font>

693
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,070
you cannot cover then you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

694
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,360
deploy multiple routing domain because

695
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple web net time we called a</font>

696
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,169
federated attack so in this case you

697
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">will have to identify the user which</font>

698
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,290
net10<font color="#CCCCCC"> level you're in and you may have</font>

699
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,320
to create multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> role in domain and</font>

700
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,570
this sometimes I mean this is proven can

701
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,889
can get into some in some very

702
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,050
compressed the network the rolling

703
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,750
architecture from<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide because we</font>

704
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:01,820
realign the ipv6 it's just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> NP RS so</font>

705
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,440
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it you're using ipv6 more</font>

706
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,210
or less like assess network so that's

707
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,340
why you will have a single ipv6 domain

708
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,390
no matter where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put a net and from</font>

709
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,010
the role in perspective you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing</font>

710
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">and make your physics packet even for</font>

711
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:17,180
encapsulation packet so you only<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain a single ipv6 domain so Nesbitt</font>

713
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,870
mean a split may move clients to a

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,929
situation I mentioned if you have a

716
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,730
multiple role in domains and you may

717
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,260
have to identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which user I am</font>

718
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,060
withdrawing work which row and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Omega I</font>

719
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,320
mean and when you move the user then you

720
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,320
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful when you do all this</font>

721
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,270
consideration but for this like when you

722
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,180
split the client to a different man all

723
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,400
you have to do is well you know what the

724
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,950
net one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> aft l1 now is running our</font>

725
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,080
capacity you just need to send a new

726
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,880
dhcp option already options to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CPU</font>

727
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that okay don't go to this net</font>

728
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,470
box anymore go to a different one and

729
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:57,020
from the scaling<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective then you</font>

730
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,730
can very easy to pour in a user to a

731
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,930
different net without touching the role

732
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:05,390
in domain so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some tests we</font>

733
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">have done in the in our lab to test it</font>

734
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if I have a DSL I running in our</font>

735
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,970
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of application I am</font>

736
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">running the what kind of application I</font>

737
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:17,780
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems so grab HTTP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS one</font>

738
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,460
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can expect that</font>

739
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,110
this is a net single net technology so

740
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,400
they would run today is it one tomorrow

741
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:29,149
same for email this single email and pop

742
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:33,469
clients or ipsec VPN a public IM

743
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:37,580
using up like yahoo i think we test

744
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:39,379
yahoo skype aim msn I mean pretty much

745
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,059
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> populate public items and in</font>

746
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:43,099
which it has both video and has is what

747
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:46,009
we all works<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a powder we deal</font>

748
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:47,839
streaming it will work if just if you

749
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:49,729
try to go to a netflix to download a

750
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,339
movie to watch it or you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ESPN free</font>

751
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:54,559
to watch a spot game it works no problem

752
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:56,479
peer-to-peer download and sitting also

753
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">well over TCP and I think it works today</font>

754
00:30:56,479 --> 00:31:00,649
on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPA will works tomorrow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font>

755
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:02,689
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only over TCP because when you</font>

756
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:06,139
start using UDP then you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do</font>

757
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:08,029
some hole punching on the cpu which rely

758
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:10,639
on you PMP then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will explain why do</font>

759
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:11,899
you can be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> work later the model we</font>

760
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:13,789
have something a test that also some

761
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:17,959
multiplayer online games<font color="#E5E5E5"> here wit has it</font>

762
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:20,419
like the more famous one like halo team

763
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">fortress world warcraft they work no</font>

764
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:24,469
problem but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to admit that we</font>

765
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:26,599
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the games in our lab and</font>

766
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:27,739
we have no intention it has every single

767
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:30,229
games because then they will fire me

768
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:36,559
because now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm playing games in the in</font>

769
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:39,080
the office so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm i mean we only test</font>

770
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,029
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> famous one so don't blame you</font>

771
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,639
slice a you've tried to test it in your

772
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:45,769
lab and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay doesn't work so i'm</font>

773
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:47,299
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the result you say which</font>

774
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:49,339
cam doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we can work</font>

775
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:50,960
together to see why but yeah the game

776
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:52,940
that most of the games wit has have no

777
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,249
problem and we also test it to go to

778
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,139
xbox live we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> successfully connect to</font>

779
00:31:55,249 --> 00:32:00,229
xbox live and then paid marie at the

780
00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:01,668
multiplayer games just like what Jason

781
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:03,379
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> upnp our GP is not going to work</font>

782
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,089
because by the protocol itself it always

783
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,009
assumed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the</font>

784
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,960
posturing and the CPU will respond just

785
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:10,789
yes or<font color="#CCCCCC"> no when you try to put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

786
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,919
net will try to do with mapping in the

787
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:15,739
network in charlotte share the 65,000

788
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,289
pot with<font color="#E5E5E5"> among users upnp by d for today</font>

789
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:19,879
is not working well now some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

790
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:22,039
application requests especially a

791
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:23,978
specific source<font color="#E5E5E5"> port such as let you try</font>

792
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:25,839
to streaming right you try to become

793
00:32:23,979 --> 00:32:28,849
streaming sort of virtual streaming

794
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:31,399
video from your home or you try to do a

795
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:33,799
gaming server which may need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bind to</font>

796
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:35,570
a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> part as we all know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

797
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,119
because now the port is shared by all

798
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,220
the users so you may not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask</font>

799
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:45,129
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like port</font>

800
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten thousand so this is what I'm trying</font>

801
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,059
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I accept already expressed</font>

802
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:51,460
so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch all the</font>

803
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:53,350
details so one by one thing one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

804
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanna point out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is an IT eventually</font>

805
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,639
form a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking go last time in</font>

806
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,590
mattress so it's called hot control

807
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:03,880
protocol this is a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Charlie</font>

808
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:05,949
address the upnp problem but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

809
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is a new protocol it may</font>

810
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to backward compatible to</font>

811
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:12,039
the existing you PMP so all the

812
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,020
implications to be lying on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bed and</font>

813
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:16,658
the oh you pee pee you amazing you're

814
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,460
not working and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before that</font>

815
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:22,900
the specific if you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a specific</font>

816
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,700
sauce pot is not going to work and this

817
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,559
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a slight apology any</font>

818
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,740
technology sharing IP with ipv4

819
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,629
addresses we have the same problem so

820
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,460
some rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> me change I'm also not going</font>

821
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to touch the details because Jason or</font>

822
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,330
dimension it so you have to now note

823
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,520
what's the time protocol IP address and

824
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:43,750
port number we need in order to identify

825
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:45,940
users you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have to find a way to</font>

826
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,230
work if let's say I application now ask

827
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a specific port on how you're going</font>

828
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,010
to solve the problem so if you don't

829
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:52,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with all this the easiest</font>

830
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:57,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">way is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go up v6 because you have</font>

831
00:33:52,450 --> 00:34:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 at the network so conclusion so dsi</font>

832
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,049
is a technology try resetting updates at

833
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">alala g-give a two-story home user</font>

834
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:07,240
without giving an ipv4 address to the

835
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:10,629
three CP and then you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have ipv6 at</font>

836
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,330
home they want the answer is still new

837
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:15,549
and are still developing in IDF so you

838
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,649
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some changes in a future in</font>

839
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:20,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">this pack so all it has we have done now</font>

840
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:22,270
is just as of like September 2010 if<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

841
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:24,009
anything any revisions comes then we may

842
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,480
have to be wise to test and we have to

843
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,659
test it again<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's whether it works or</font>

844
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,369
not so service provider also accounting

845
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,710
for water you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prepare to</font>

846
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,149
identify users by port and IP because

847
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,780
now you cannot just identify users by

848
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:39,730
poet and also ipv6 is preferred because

849
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,560
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all this issue or</font>

850
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,330
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal with all this and dsi</font>

851
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,089
already give a v6 directly to the user

852
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,889
day one so last thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you</font>

853
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:50,440
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually all that stuff I have</font>

is a DSL based access network which was

made almost nine years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

875
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:07,780
quite old infrastructure and second one

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTTH access network which is newly</font>

877
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:15,730
developing listen tree then we choose

<font color="#CCCCCC">6ld for our ages access network so today</font>

879
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:21,730
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain why we choose six FD for</font>

00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,069
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s the access net good network</font>

881
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:26,830
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're we choose different</font>

882
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:30,000
solution for<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTTH access network because</font>

883
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:34,480
it has different collect characteristics

884
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:38,410
then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right shows current situation</font>

885
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:42,820
of our adsl access network then our adss

886
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:45,520
access network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPP fo only network so</font>

887
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:49,300
it means replacing or upgrading old

888
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:53,110
devices to enable<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not really</font>

889
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:58,020
statistics actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of equipment</font>

890
00:36:53,110 --> 00:37:02,710
is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 10,000 so it's impossible</font>

891
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:04,660
also we will need so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need 60 powerful</font>

892
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,090
technology to provide ipv6 connectivity

893
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:11,460
for our

894
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:15,810
then actually subscriber on our adss

895
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:18,510
service is<font color="#CCCCCC"> are moving to ftth so it</font>

896
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:22,140
means number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of subscriber is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly</font>

897
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">depressing so also existing subscriber</font>

898
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:29,549
already have global ipv4 address so we

899
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:34,350
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for to provide ipv6</font>

900
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:37,830
connectivity also we are providing a dsl

901
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:40,589
modems as<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPEs we can control their</font>

902
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,840
software and last point is very

903
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,930
important point nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

904
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,350
IP basics transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's truth so we</font>

905
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:51,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">should minimize all costs enabling</font>

906
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:54,779
provisioning devices and maintenance or

907
00:37:51,920 --> 00:38:00,120
yeah like that everything we should mean

908
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:02,310
buys everything then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of</font>

909
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,859
text<font color="#CCCCCC"> on right hand side but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> freeze</font>

910
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:08,640
admitted because it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be explained in</font>

911
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:11,040
latest right the point is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6ld we have</font>

912
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,279
two different component personally is

913
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,270
lil a louder which is located in our

914
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,550
head end and the second point second

915
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:25,350
single portion is cpe which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> located</font>

916
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:28,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">in users home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also a user users home</font>

917
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:31,200
network is dual dual stack and all of

918
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:35,549
course external network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> job stack bad</font>

919
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:39,810
and access network IP basics is not

920
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:47,180
enabled so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should pass this part by</font>

921
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:52,230
using I 6ld then this<font color="#CCCCCC"> road shows how the</font>

922
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:57,770
late outer and cpe can figure out v6

923
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:57,770
prefix first of all where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are using</font>

924
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:08,310
2001 db8<font color="#CCCCCC"> rush 32 as six LD prefix then</font>

925
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:13,830
from this prefix cpe can easily figure

926
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:16,830
out its ipv6 prefix address actually it

927
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,640
needs six LD prefix address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

928
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:20,308
grow

929
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">ball I be brief address on this ride i'm</font>

930
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:25,279
using private<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 address but actually</font>

931
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:30,450
we are using global IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> be full address</font>

932
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:32,430
then first started so long prefix

933
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:36,328
address which will be assigned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

934
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:38,519
subscriber is determined by first<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32-bit</font>

935
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:41,069
is determined by six out of the prefix

936
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:45,899
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> copied from it and secondly</font>

937
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:50,579
32-bit is copy a global ipv4 address

938
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:53,930
which is assigned for each subscriber so

939
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:59,849
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple and there's no</font>

940
00:39:53,930 --> 00:40:03,538
provisioning for cpe then this red shows

941
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:08,250
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> little outer and cpe proceed</font>

942
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:12,660
incoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet first of all real a</font>

943
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:17,660
louder when when receive ipv6 packet

944
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:20,910
from from outside the late outer check

945
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:25,440
normal IPS whisks out in table and<font color="#CCCCCC"> latin</font>

946
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:29,730
table says<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok it's if verse 32 bit much</font>

947
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,549
to 600 prefix sense to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tunnel interface</font>

948
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:36,839
then tunnel interface checks second a

949
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:41,450
32-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> add 32 bit of this nation ipv6</font>

950
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:47,788
address then extract it then make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

951
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:51,598
make it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it as yeah destination</font>

952
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:53,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv4 address oh sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mixed ipv4 IP</font>

953
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,150
pics basics because it is very

954
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:59,789
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so making ipv4 header</font>

955
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,009
is very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> just extracting</font>

956
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:05,009
extracting second<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 32 bit of</font>

957
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:09,480
destination IP basics address and make

958
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:12,539
it to this mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 address then</font>

959
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,930
send it based on ipv4 routing table so

960
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:21,210
it's very simple and state rest so it

961
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:23,879
means it is very hot scalable then CP

962
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:27,839
lauter receives tongue tonio packet and

963
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,319
it just remove ipv4 header because it is

964
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">tonya solution you don't need to</font>

965
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:40,009
make IP bisque basics header so just

966
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:43,089
sent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user host and we can also we</font>

967
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:46,910
can censor i'll show how to proceed

968
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:49,190
outgoing packet and we can we can say

969
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:55,190
almost same thing with previous packages

970
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:59,420
it's also very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

971
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:04,660
also use same same way for a packet

972
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:11,690
between between subscribers in this case

973
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:15,680
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we assume we assume</font>

974
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:19,249
distinction ipv6 address is 2001<font color="#CCCCCC"> db8</font>

975
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:25,399
ABCD and sssss it is destination IP

976
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:28,549
basics address and CP CP<font color="#CCCCCC"> lauter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

977
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:32,089
extract second<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 32 bit of destination</font>

978
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:36,619
ipv6 address then copy it to ipv4 header

979
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:39,859
so it's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

980
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:46,339
thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay packet out going to</font>

981
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:49,038
internet then it is just right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

982
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:51,890
think six healthy may works well if you

983
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:54,680
your network is IP we've only enable

984
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:57,828
networks and also you have enough number

985
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,578
of global<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP addresses and sorry I made</font>

986
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:04,519
this ride in this in breakfast so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

987
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:09,229
forget one important point also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

988
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:14,029
to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should control it is it is also</font>

989
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:17,718
important you can control software of

990
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:20,479
each subscribes software of CP lauter it

991
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:23,119
is another important point then if your

992
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:25,549
network is already just a very basic

993
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,640
salary enabled you don't need six LD of

994
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:30,739

and some work on that for six and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what so in process so to go</font>

1035
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:51,670
through an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of the net 64 case</font>

1036
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:55,030
nat64 is basically where you have a v6

1037
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:58,900
client trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to a v4</font>

1038
00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:00,450
over there are working group draft on

1039
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,300
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behavior working group</font>

1040
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:06,669
basically you have a DNS lookup through

1041
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,360
the name server that gives you back the

1042
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:13,650
DNS that through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS 64 it gives</font>

1043
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:18,490
you back the v6 address of the v4 server

1044
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:21,540
and then you can do your you normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

1045
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:25,450
connect type messages through the nat64

1046
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,740
what's not necessarily obvious on the

1047
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:29,049
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that there has to be some</font>

1048
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,209
coupling between the DNS 64 and at six

1049
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:34,930
for implementation because the DNS has

1050
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:37,840
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to calculate the v6 address</font>

1051
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:41,799
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> map is going to use for the</font>

1052
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,510
translation so you've got to do some

1053
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,360
carefully coordinated configuration of

1054
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:48,640
the equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so other proprietary</font>

1055
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:55,990
mechanism to make sure that stuff stays

1056
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:57,640
in sync so the at 46 case is exactly the

1057
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:01,689
opposite you've got a default client

1058
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:04,990
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to a v6 server I didn't go</font>

1060
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,430

1061
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,070
be a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> more likely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the near term</font>

00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:13,390

the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of servers on the internet</font>

1064
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:20,950
this far more v4 so that was out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

than<font color="#CCCCCC"> d6 service issues with address</font>

fricassee translation it's basically a

1067
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:28,740
form of nap so all the regular nap

issues they will still apply anything

1071
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:40,750
the double map probably still applies

1072
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:41,859
anything with that 44 44 44 44 44 would

1073
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:46,150
however many variants you want to go

1074
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:47,710
through that probably still applies and

1075
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,050
and you add a whole new set of problems

1076
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">because now it's not this extent way and</font>

1077
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:54,280
so essentially these six stuff is

1078
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:56,259
potentially broken as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long</font>

that's maybe not quite so obvious when

we have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes remaining</font>

1160
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:50,950
intentionally so lots of different

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,050
possibilities presented here we would

1162
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:56,319
love to entertain questions about any of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the transition technologies displayed</font>

00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,850
here operational considerations I should

1165
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:03,310
have mentioned there we have panel

1166
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:04,509
following us that will be describing

1167
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:09,279
some of the operational considerations

1168
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:11,530
for these technologies yes sir Martin

1169
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,090
leave you from hurricane electric as

1170
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:15,010
much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an operational panel</font>

1171
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:18,690
afterwards I'd still<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know from</font>

1172
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:22,210
from these participants and speakers

1173
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:24,790
performance issues because what this has

1174
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:27,340
done is laid out very clearly the

1175
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:30,279
different protocols pluses and minuses

1176
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:33,850
but really I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operational side</font>

1177
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,440
has been very much left aside from this

1178
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,089
discussion and I wonder if it's possible

1179
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,580
even from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point just to have a</font>

1180
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:42,550
quick word from anybody who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:46,360
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but the first thing I</font>

1182
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:48,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">can think of is any of these solutions</font>

1183
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,120
if you put a box in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

1184
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">someplace that is not the optimal path</font>

1185
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,170
which if it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your core network it's</font>

1186
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,000
not necessarily going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be optimal path</font>

1187
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:00,190
for all traffic that's going to add some

1188
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,230
latency and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you add a box</font>

1189
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,810
that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to add a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font>

1190
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:06,280
latency so exactly how much your mileage

1191
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:09,040
will vary depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the box and where</font>

1192
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:13,750
you put it anybody have any further

1193
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:16,660
comments that one I guess the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1194
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:19,810
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is redundancy particularly with</font>

1196
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:26,970
lot of these tend to introduce a a

1197
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:29,710
single point<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure mechanism somehow</font>

1198
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:32,799
that's that's probably even worse as you

1199
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:34,150
get towards the cpe implementations as

1200
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:40,030

1204
00:53:46,299 --> 00:53:52,269
it's it's nice to see that we're getting

<font color="#E5E5E5">the ipv6 transition stuff further into</font>

1206
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:56,890
the home but they're there seems to be a

1207
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:59,339
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a missing piece to me and I'm</font>

1208
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:02,828
hoping to some of the panel can address

1209
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:04,390
the current work seems very concerned on

1210
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:06,959
getting down to the home gateway level

1211
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:11,589
and figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to make</font>

1212
00:54:06,959 --> 00:54:13,359
legacy b4 devices work behind that one

1213
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:14,499
of the concerns that I hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> over and</font>

1214
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,788
over about that is people aren't

1215
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:18,640
generally worried about someone's

1216
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:20,499
windows box or Mac being able to do v6

1217
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,259
at the appropriate time there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1218
00:54:20,499 --> 00:54:25,089
worry about these embedded home you know

00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:28,059
consumer electronic key<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of things</font>

1220
00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:30,578
and I find that very interesting myself

1221
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:33,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">because just to pick on a random example</font>

1222
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:35,499
with say a Playstation or an xbox they

1223
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:38,170
already have a mechanism because people

1224
00:54:35,499 --> 00:54:39,848
hack them every Tuesday that when you

1225
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:41,589
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on it says I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

1226
00:54:39,849 --> 00:54:44,829
allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything until you do</font>

1227
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:46,569
the mandatory upgrade and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering</font>

1228
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:49,269
if any of these large providers have

1233
00:54:56,499 --> 00:55:00,399
as a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid having some of the</font>

00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:09,099
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition strategy is to work with</font>

those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push native ipv6 around</font>

1238
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:12,880
the same time you enabled and so I'm

1239
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:15,880
wondering if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody is working that</font>

when I need it and I have told them and

I<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to sort of the standard online</font>

here are the standard crystal balls and

1251
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:48,729
you know how a lot reliable those are

1252
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:50,019
all of them have said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah maybe</font>

any particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> urgency I have also</font>

some of the those those kind

1257
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,230
of companies into a room to give

1258
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:06,880
presentations maybe a little bit more

1259
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">time than this to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what what</font>

1260
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,150
the requirements are why they're there

1261
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:12,820
and what happens if they don't do

1262
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:14,380
anything any you know any help with that

1263
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I certainly think this is a community</font>

1264
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,730
that should be able to exercise some

1265
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:21,479
some support in making those kinds of

1266
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:24,430
things happen as far and you mentioned

1267
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,080
you know pcs and macs and guess we know

1268
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,330
that those operating systems are capable

1269
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:30,790
of supporting ipv6 some versions better

1270
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:32,440
than others<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know so at least</font>

1271
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,690
there we have mechanisms and I agree

1272
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consoles do a pretty good job</font>

1273
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:40,240
of pushing updates so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a</font>

1274
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:45,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">hmm that is a better solution than any</font>

1275
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:49,569
of these yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we actually impair</font>

1276
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:52,000
out so we actively talk to the equipment

1277
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors to the party v6 by the same</font>

1278
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,360
times that we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to preserve the</font>

1279
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,220
investment from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the home so they already</font>

1280
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,690
have it so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying that I okay</font>

1281
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,040
yeah we can help<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we already have a</font>

1282
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology which helps the legacy</font>

1283
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,820
equipment so you don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push ipv6</font>

1284
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,530
so totally wrong so we're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1285
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,850
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it in parallel but we just</font>

1286
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have two</font>

1287
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:11,430
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the investment for the current</font>

1288
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,620
existing equipments and that's it oh

1289
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:17,379
well oh well<font color="#E5E5E5"> echo that is my biggest</font>

1290
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:19,900
concern as well and just trying to get

1291
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:22,270
the consumer electronic industry to

1292
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,190
understand what's coming and how they

1293
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to react is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big big</font>

1294
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,760
challenge so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes it's</font>

1295
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,740
amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I found out is</font>

1296
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,320
the power of best buy and this debate

1297
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,819
until something<font color="#CCCCCC"> until they actually</font>

1298
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked for something things just don't</font>

1299
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,780
get implemented women actually need to

1300
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:41,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">go that route versus trying to go</font>

1301
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:44,940
directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the source and Rudolf</font>

1302
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:47,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cascadia one of my big concerns is that</font>

1303
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:50,950
transition technologies turn into

1304
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:52,780
becoming the status quo and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

1305
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:55,029
concern that I have with the ones that

1306
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:58,750
we talked about this morning is the quad

1307
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:02,370
NAT<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how that could very easily go</font>

1308
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:06,100
from being a crutch that we use to

1309
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:08,509
deploy ipv6 to something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1310
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:11,150
prohibits ipv6 from

1311
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:13,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">really making it into the network</font>

1312
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:17,000
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so easy to do</font>

1313
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:20,330
large-scale net everywhere and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

1314
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,050
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with new tricks that you know</font>

1315
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:26,509
make you<font color="#E5E5E5"> upnp and all those other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

1316
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:28,700
work there'll be new technologies to

1317
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:31,580
make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> work through multiples and</font>

1318
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:33,680
multiples of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nats so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like to you</font>

1319
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,900
know pepper the panel a little bit about

1320
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,810
what kind of things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we</font>

1321
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:42,800
can do to prevent these technologies

1322
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:47,000
that that are available and specifically

1323
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:50,150
quad quad for<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat to prevent it from</font>

1324
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,300
being a crutch that we use for 10 to 20

1325
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:55,580
30 years rather than actually doing the

1326
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,040
work that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing to</font>

1327
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:03,290
actually make the hard architectural

1328
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:05,300
changes to to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves into a</font>

1329
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">better place rather than continuing on</font>

1330
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:13,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the old way of doing things i can start</font>

1331
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:17,419
on that one so at least in my experience

1332
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:20,450
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience between native v6 and nat</font>

1333
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:22,550
v4 isn't the same so if you can't offer

1334
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:24,470
both their show there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a</font>

1335
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,630
perception the user will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

1336
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">it for a clear differential between</font>

1337
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:31,280
those two services so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think metal</font>

1338
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:34,940
drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially for talking about- DV 6</font>

1339
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,950
plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> nat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dual stack model I think you'll</font>

1340
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">see that drive toward v6 just just</font>

1341
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,529
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to expect a</font>

1342
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:42,590
better experience than what they're

1343
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:44,900
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other side and one</font>

1344
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:46,700
thing I've also want to add is of in

1345
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,070
different country they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1346
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,560
different deployment models so I think

1347
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">in some of the growing developing</font>

1348
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,970
country they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a higher demand</font>

1349
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,970
for ipv4 addresses and they cannot do it

1350
00:59:55,970 --> 01:00:00,919
immediately so the bottom line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1351
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,120
any technology be deploying here we call

1352
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,920
it transitioned technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> we child</font>

1353
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,210
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a course hidden to</font>

1354
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,210
deploy this and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making any</font>

1355
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:10,460
avenue from it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we are pushing very</font>

1356
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,960
hard for ipv6 yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you touched</font>

1357
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,430
on the key point right there is the

1358
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,350
operational overhead for this is quite

1359
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:17,509
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not something you're going</font>

1360
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,609
to want to do for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> full set of your</font>

1361
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:23,200
customers I would

1362
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:24,700
I surely wouldn't i think the real

1363
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,390
answer is as long as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user</font>

1364
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:31,180
transaction is still a v4 to v4 thing

1365
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:34,538
then then the ISPs are basically pushing

1366
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:37,749
on a string the we can get dual stack

1367
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:41,950
out there but until you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

1368
01:00:37,749 --> 01:00:47,189
on the six servers and you get a real v6

1369
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:53,249
web that<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-users are trying to get to</font>

1370
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:55,230
where we're we're stuck in transition

1371
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:57,368
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I appreciate the the</font>

1372
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversations fantastic but I need to</font>

1373
01:00:57,369 --> 01:01:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">close the mics killer a couple minutes</font>

1374
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">over but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the long hurricane electric</font>

1375
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:06,430
and just to further address Andrews

1376
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:08,739
question all of these trade all of these

1377
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:10,839
transitional technologies come it such a

1378
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:14,230
high operational cost and with so many

1379
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:16,779
trade-offs in the user experience I

1380
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:19,269
can't imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanting to live with them</font>

1381
01:01:16,779 --> 01:01:22,630
long term at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier level at the</font>

1382
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:24,549
subscriber level at<font color="#CCCCCC"> any level I just</font>

1383
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,809
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine anybody wanting to keep</font>

1384
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:28,269
these deployed any longer than

1385
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:30,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely necessary I would go to great</font>

1386
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:33,549
lengths to avoid using any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

1387
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:35,499
comment here is we cannot do it as long

1388
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:36,759
as an operator if like<font color="#E5E5E5"> other content</font>

1389
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:38,680
providers already quite all the

1390
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:40,299
equipment's whether they can walk with

1391
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,339
us together to push their equipment or

1392
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:43,720
ipv6 because Indian is from the user

1393
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:45,849
perspective don't care as we for with

1394
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,410
six other care services if we can bet we

1395
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:49,569
can provide as a community provide

1396
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:55,538
better services to the user /<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ipv6</font>

1397
01:01:49,569 --> 01:01:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">then this will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> successful ok thank</font>

1398
01:01:55,539 --> 01:01:57,900
y'all very much
