1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:09,649
okay so it's now nod 50 and we wanted to

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,429
celebrate nanog and and it's and it's

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,780
all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have happened here</font>

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,389
over the years so I went and I looked at

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,250
the UM I looked at the past meetings and

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,890
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you if</font>

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,500
you go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wwa organ look in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font>

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">past meetings there there's archives all</font>

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,080
the way back but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">first meeting so you can look at the</font>

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,250
second one and look at the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,519
things that people were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,780
it's really quite illuminating but so we

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,000
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out who would be</font>

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,890
the appropriate keynote for nanog 50 and

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,010
it turned out that one of the people who

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">shepherded um what was then joint Tech's</font>

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,710
into what is now nanog was Elise Garrick

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,969
and she gracefully accepted our

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,649
invitation to talk so we're really

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,870
looking forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> having her talk she's</font>

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,260
standing over there come on over she has

23
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,690
a talk called the end of the beginning

24
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,099
and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking forward to it but</font>

25
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,780
one of the other things that I kind of

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,600
found interesting about it is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,979
doesn't have any PowerPoint no slides so

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
this you know it's like it's like

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,548
remember the day when there was no

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,450
slides well maybe money some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys</font>

31
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,740
maybe don't but it used to be that you

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was no slides and then there</font>

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,309
was transparencies remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> drawn</font>

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
the transparencies and then there was

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,509
PowerPoint and all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know well you</font>

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,639
know but anyway so please welcome Elise

37
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,640
and looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your top</font>

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,770
thanks Dave actually I was looking for

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,860
the overhead projector since I this is

40
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,449
about the end of the beginning I want to

41
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all very much for inviting me</font>

42
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,550
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak at the 50th meeting of nanog I</font>

43
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,979
spoke at the first and now I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

44
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,000
speak at the 50th it's quite a quite a

45
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,890
privilege so the end of the beginning

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,260
the reason I chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> this title for the</font>

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,330
50th is that I really want it I was

48
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,610
asked to speak actually about the

49
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,429
beginning and the beginning was the

50
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,310
regional text and that was back in

51
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,020
nineteen<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty eight and you probably</font>

52
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,080
all have read your<font color="#CCCCCC"> history books about</font>

53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,829
that but the regional text was the

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:18,150
beginning and in 1994 it was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:21,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of that beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 1994 we had the</font>

56
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,990
last regional text meeting in San Diego

57
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,660
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we said okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time we're</font>

58
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,400
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technology transfer the</font>

59
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,280
National Science Foundation which had

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,940
been funding the NSFNET backbone and the

61
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,040
regional networks was actually going to

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,930
phase out they were going to transfer

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,679
all that technology to commercial

64
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,540
service providers and that was going to

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we were going to kind of close the</font>

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">doors on the NSFNET regional</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tex had</font>

67
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,880
grown up<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of the NSFNET because</font>

68
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,989
when NSFNET started it was a

69
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:02,150
collaboration between IBM MCI and merit

70
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:06,209
and at the first regional text meeting

71
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:08,580
MCI and IBM got kind of blasted by the

72
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,050
regional text guys first of all they

73
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,440
didn't believe em see I knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

74
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,870
about data which was true they didn't

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,200
believe IBM knew anything about building

76
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,580
routers which was true and they really

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,609
didn't believe merit could pull it off

78
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,930
with IBM and MCI so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that kind of</font>

79
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:31,290
interesting meeting in fact there's a

80
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,850
small story about that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the first</font>

81
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,890
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'd attended and many of</font>

82
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,150
the people that have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hired for the</font>

83
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,630
NSFNET backbone and I my name's Elise

84
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,510
Phoebus<font color="#CCCCCC"> Garrick Phoebus with a pea</font>

85
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,010
so anyway I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing one of those</font>

86
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,679
monogrammed sweaters that were quite

87
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:54,679
popular back in the 80s so it said II a

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,370
big G in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and a P and I was</font>

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,570
standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and Ed crawl from</font>

90
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,020
University of Illinois came up to me and

91
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:07,130
said what's your metric so if you know

92
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that means you're as old as I am so</font>

93
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:14,750
my monogram was EGP but anyway so we

94
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:18,140
thought we really need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get together</font>

95
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,660
and build a community here the regional

96
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the regional guys were their own</font>

97
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,230
individual communities<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit was its own</font>

98
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">individual community and IBM and MCI</font>

99
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,610
where the new guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we were bringing</font>

100
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,710
them into the community so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we said we</font>

101
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,910
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring us all together because</font>

102
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,560
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to work very very</font>

103
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,400
hard in order to make this thing work

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,730
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of reason that</font>

105
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,679
regional<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tex got started and Susan hairs</font>

106
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:50,030
was one of the first people to kind of

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,530
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the agendas and she finally</font>

108
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,299
turned that over to me because she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

109
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,150
too busy building the policy routing

110
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,130
database but at one of the first

111
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,739
meetings she said you know we're going

112
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to have snacks during the breaks</font>

113
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,810
and we're going to also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have</font>

114
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">lunch because you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know Elise likes to</font>

115
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,350
eat so I'm like mortified I'm saying oh

116
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,210
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god but that kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started this</font>

117
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,280
trend you know that was the beginning of

118
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,560
all the food<font color="#E5E5E5"> at nanog meetings and</font>

119
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,580
regional text meetings we've never been

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,460
foodless since so anyway we started the

121
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,370
regional text meeting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that became</font>

122
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,370
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular quickly I think I</font>

123
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,370
touched something on a computer sorry

124
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:37,570
that quickly expanded beyond our

125
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,770
immediate community more and more

126
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,840
academic and research networks from

127
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,979
across the world started participating

128
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,570
in the regional text meetings there

129
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,990
started to be commercial service

130
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:54,440
providers alternate and others that got

131
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,340
started psi net they started attending

132
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,040
the meetings

133
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:02,060
then vendors like to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so Cisco</font>

134
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:05,540
and others like to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up so as we were</font>

135
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:09,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this technology transfer in 1994</font>

136
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:12,229
we had this meeting in San Diego and we

137
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,900
said okay the<font color="#E5E5E5"> regional text has been</font>

138
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:18,770
highly successful do you guys want to

139
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,440
continue it was a community question it

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:31,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">find out okay does anyone really care if</font>

143
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,669
regional text continues there was

144
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,700
overwhelming response everybody wanted

to do it we liked each other we liked

146

working together we were inclusive so we

147
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,560
said okay but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we're going to do this</font>

148
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,870
you know we can't be regional text

149
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,850
anymore because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really isn't about</font>

150
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,030
the regional networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United</font>

151
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:56,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">States this is about the global Internet</font>

152
00:06:53,030 --> 00:07:01,010
this is much bigger so what should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

153
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:03,770
call ourselves well that was a very long

154
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,190
discussion so one of the ideas was how

155
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:11,150
about the engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> Planning Group</font>

156
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:14,960
well that's EGP he's the note EPG that's

157
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,909
me it couldn't be EPG again and also

158
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was already taken the federal</font>

159
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,280
engineering planning group existed there

160
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,650
was the IEP G so you couldn't use

161
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,909
international engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> Planning Group</font>

162
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,049
or internet Engineering Planning Group

163
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:33,860
people tried to come up with all sorts

164
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:36,500
of other names<font color="#CCCCCC"> and finally someone said</font>

165
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,729
well how about network operators group

166
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,950
and then our worldwide community said

167
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:45,530
well but you know you're kind of based

168
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:48,590
in the US you're you're really not

169
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,919
worldwide you can't be the network

170
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,049
operators group so we debated and

171
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,430
debated and we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> on North American</font>

172
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,340
network operators group Oh finally what

173
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,740
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> relief we had a name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

174
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,669
debate didn't end unfortunately how do

175
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we say</font>

176
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:15,350
oh gee is it nae nog is it nuh nog is it

177
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,360
nanog who are we how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say it</font>

178
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,810
actually that took about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three meetings</font>

179
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,720
we couldn't resolve that in one was not

180
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:29,800
such a simple thing finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

181
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,800
realize we did stick with nanog so

182
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,230
january nineteen ninety-four was the

183
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:39,380
time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that regional text would</font>

184
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:41,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">morph into nanog there was a charter</font>

185
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,909
written by Mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> napper and myself you</font>

186
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">can find it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ancient</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> history files</font>

187
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:50,689
on the nanog page and on the Merritt

188
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">webpage and since that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time we've had</font>

189
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,490
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> many different chairpersons or</font>

190
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,619
mistresses of ceremony I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

191
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">of myself as a chair and I was the first</font>

192
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,250
mistress of ceremony for the nanog

193
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:07,370
meetings and we were somewhat loosely

194
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,710
organized in those days Merritt

195
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,080
continued to sponsor as they do today

196
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,710
and they've always been a very gracious

197
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,050
sponsor but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that point in time we had</font>

198
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:23,200
to grow because now we were no longer

199
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:26,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">under the government umbrella and in</font>

200
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,970
1995 I handed over my mistress of

201
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,530
ceremony hat to Bill Norton who became

202
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:36,500
the chair and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill at that time was</font>

203
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:39,410
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business school and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog</font>

204
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,180
was kind of like his experiment bill

205
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,520
decided that all the things he learned

206
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,449
in business school he should test on

207
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">nano most of them were very successful</font>

208
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:54,650
so he you know instituted the beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

209
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:57,920
gear he instituted numbering nanog he

210
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:00,709
decided we needed t-shirts builded an

211
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,229
awful lot of neat things and he did get

212
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,450
sponsorships which helped him as you saw

213
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,780
the day you can't have these meetings

214
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,870
without the sponsors but bill also was a

215
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,079
very interesting speaker even before he

216
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">became the chair a long time ago when we</font>

217
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,440
were still using the overhead<font color="#CCCCCC"> projector</font>

218
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,719
we were video

219
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,000
taping also some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meetings and</font>

220
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,650
some of the presentations and so bill

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he was walking back and</font>

222
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,920
forth I can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because you won't</font>

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,930
hear me but he would walk back and forth

224
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,469
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from side to side but much</font>

225
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,719
further and then all of a sudden

226
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,780
disappear<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he do it over and over</font>

227
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,920
again we're going what the heck<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font>

228
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:45,620
on so after his presentation I think

229
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">cadny and I together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we said what</font>

230
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,000
were you thinking he said I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

231
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:55,040
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cameraman could keep up with</font>

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,350
me so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was always very</font>

233
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:04,280
collegial and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we had</font>

234
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:06,260
such good times so anyway we did end we

235
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,959
started nanog and it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and</font>

236
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,270
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought how can I spend 45</font>

237
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,030
minutes just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the history</font>

238
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,310
how boring can that be so I really

239
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:21,920
thought I needed to give you a few

240
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:23,930
stories so one of the stories was we had

241
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,000
one chair who always opened the meetings

242
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,069
with a joke this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person I've mentioned</font>

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,560
at least twice now so that was Bill

244
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:34,040
Norton and those were the worst jokes I

245
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,859
think I've ever heard in my life I think

246
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,490
one of them was why<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the chicken lay</font>

247
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:43,340
two eggs the answer is because one is

248
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,430
not enough so if you were a spec French

249
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,980
speaker you might say enough so anyway

250
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:56,540
you didn't laugh neither did we back in

251
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:58,580
the day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I heard from Craig</font>

252
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,569
labovitz this morning that in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> early</font>

253
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,130
days of Wi-Fi he'd gotten a whole bunch

254
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,490
merritt had gotten a whole bunch of

255
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,470
Wi-Fi repeaters from deck and they were

256
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,190
having an anode meeting in one of those

257
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,650
huge big hotels with atriums and so they

258
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,110
were in early in the morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking</font>

259
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,270
around planting the repeaters in the

260
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,670
planters on the different floors to see

261
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:25,490
how far<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could get Wi-Fi up to their</font>

262
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,790
room well I guess someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't really</font>

263
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,310
understand why they were gardening and

264
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,319
putting these electronic

265
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,609
things in the planters so the security

266
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,770
guards were called and so Craig and his

267
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,870
cohort had to try and explain that these

268
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,939
were Wi-Fi their wireless you could

269
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,860
actually get connections and they said

270
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean and they said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well you</font>

271
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,490
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet well hotel didn't</font>

272
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,279
even have internet access it was prior

273
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know luckily he</font>

274
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,300
wasn't arrested and he was able to

275
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to be the chair of the meeting</font>

276
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,279
that day but that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

277
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,660
things that had happened one of the

278
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:08,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">stories that mark nopper wanted to share</font>

279
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,350
was how nanog and its community was

280
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,680
always very socially conscious and we

281
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,510
had planned a meeting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colorado once</font>

282
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,160
Colorado at that time had just decided

283
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:24,250
to pass some legislation which was

284
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">anti-gay rights so there was a large</font>

285
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,910
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nanog community that really</font>

286
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,320
didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the meeting they</font>

287
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,589
wanted to boycott the meeting in

288
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,060
Colorado because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this legislation</font>

289
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,890
there was a big debate you know what to

290
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,280
do should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boycott should we not</font>

291
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:41,199
boycott you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal so the</font>

292
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,990
compromise solution was well we would

293
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,530
invite a gay rights speaker and put them

294
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the agenda so we expanded the agenda</font>

295
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:54,430
and then we did have the meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

296
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:56,500
Colorado after all so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just a</font>

297
00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,099
few of the stories that I wanted to

298
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">share and I think one of the most</font>

299
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,860
well-known story is the one about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob</font>

300
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,839
Metcalfe and can I see a show of hands

301
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,700
how many of you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard about the Bob</font>

302
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:15,870
Metcalfe story oh you have the shirt you

303
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,640
have both shirts or just one shirt wow

304
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:22,180
so that means quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you haven't</font>

305
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,959
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story so I'll read the quote</font>

306
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,430
first of all in 1995 and well I should

307
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask a show of hands who knows who Bob</font>

308
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,380
Metcalfe is that's good if you didn't

309
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,329
raise your hand you were in big trouble

310
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:40,020
you were in the wrong meeting

311
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:42,780
so in 1995<font color="#CCCCCC"> bob metcalfe attended one of</font>

312
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,939
the nanog meetings and afterwards he

313
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,370
wrote something and he was a long

314
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,310
article but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pieces of the</font>

315
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,550
article said if nanog is to lead us

316
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:56,280
toward an industrial-strength internet

317
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,770
then it must<font color="#E5E5E5"> now urgently attract the</font>

318
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:03,089
active participation of many more men

319
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:05,520
and women who routinely wear suits so if

320
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,260
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the room we seem to have</font>

321
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">done okay we're not wearing too many</font>

322
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:14,220
suits yet or we left him<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the closet</font>

323
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:17,280
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that led</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a whole spat of</font>

324
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,270
emails there was a big big furor lots of

325
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,420
back and forth on the nanog list and

326
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:28,410
finally Bob wrote back and what he said

327
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,510
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had misunderstood him and what he</font>

328
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:35,459
really meant was good engineers are too

329
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:37,350
valuable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> overdress so but he did</font>

330
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,320
think that in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the internet and</font>

331
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:43,680
nanog to continue to succeed we would

332
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,950
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in</font>

333
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,050
suits who were more business-minded and

334
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,330
just less technical minded<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

335
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:56,329
nan augs managed to survive all this

336
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:59,490
time by being inclusive and so we don't

337
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:03,750
frown necessarily on suits but we don't

338
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:05,910
necessarily adopt them either so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

339
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,340
other thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Metcalfe had said as he</font>

340
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:11,969
predicted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> collapse of the Internet</font>

341
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:14,190
in 1996 and he and Bill got into a

342
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,560
sparring on that and I guess Metcalf

343
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,600
said well I'd eat my words if it doesn't

344
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,229
collapse because of course it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

345
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,750
collapse and sure enough in 1996 he ate

346
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,690
his words and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his second Bob</font>

347
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,460
Metcalfe shirt so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who</font>

348
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,100
haven't seen it bill has a really nice

349
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,990
website that has the picture of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

350
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:40,710
nanog t-shirts including the Bob

351
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:42,510
Metcalfe collectors items so I didn't

352
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to belabor this with too</font>

353
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,110
much history<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

354
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,470
small stories from

355
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,350
our early days and then I thought I'd

356
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:56,519
like to give you a little quiz and those

357
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:58,079
of you who raised your hand for I guess

358
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,060
three out of three questions you

359
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,459
obviously either read your history or

360
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:06,419
you were there and you're an old<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray</font>

361
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:08,879
head like me so please<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise your hand</font>

362
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,750
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what a foil is and I don't</font>

363
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,199
mean a fencing foil hopes not too many

364
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,540
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's one question second</font>

365
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,750
question right I give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a hint earlier</font>

366
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:26,579
do you know what EGP is what does the

367
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:29,130
protocol stand for<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good work good</font>

368
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:33,480
work and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one is do you</font>

369
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,950
know what whirlyball is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those of</font>

370
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,320
you who raised your hand for whirlyball

371
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:43,559
are truly the nanog pioneers so in the

372
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,899
early days of nanog we had in fact in

373
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,820
regional<font color="#E5E5E5"> tex we had introduced socials</font>

374
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,160
and I heard you all had a great social

375
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,480
last night at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aquarium they've</font>

376
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,760
gotten a lot more organized a lot more

377
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,520
sophisticated maybe but boy did we have

378
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,030
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> with whirlyball now whirlyball for</font>

379
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,410
those of you have the uninitiated is

380
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:10,410
kind of like lacrosse in bumper cars and

381
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:12,660
you have two teams of five you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

382
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,030
basketball<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoop and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a highly</font>

383
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,540
racket and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving these little</font>

384
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,700
electric cars so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 15 you're not</font>

385
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,460
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out of the car and you</font>

386
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,770
have a wiffle ball<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can pass the</font>

387
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,919
wiffle ball around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to shoot</font>

388
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,590
a basket and you get points so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a</font>

389
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">great game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was great fun and it</font>

390
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:38,730
was self funded so we used to see who

391
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:41,250
wanted to play whirlyball we collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

392
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,130
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was the money collector then</font>

393
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:47,130
we'd buy cases of beer and we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to</font>

394
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:50,190
the whirlyball place and we'd split up

395
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,860
into teams well<font color="#CCCCCC"> after a few whirly ball</font>

396
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,919
games there were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people who only</font>

397
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,570
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with each other and they</font>

398
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,180
became the<font color="#E5E5E5"> superstars</font>

399
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,720
they were led by Vince fuller the fence

400
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,910
around anyway Vince had the superstar

401
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,980
team and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty awesome they</font>

402
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,140
really really really didn't want anybody

403
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,980
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there else on their team because they</font>

404
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:17,310
were winners except when they lost as

405
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cathy just said so then we had everybody</font>

406
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:22,020
else and then we had some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

407
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:25,020
never won so they decided to form their

408
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:28,770
own team they were kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> also-rans</font>

409
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:31,170
and they challenged Vince's team he was

410
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,000
kind of I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think maybe the last whirly</font>

411
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,650
ball game because I know the superstars

412
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,680
never played after that they were so

413
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:40,260
crushed but they did lose the game but

414
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you ever get a chance you really</font>

415
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,490
should do an<font color="#E5E5E5"> an odd tradition and go</font>

416
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,740
play whirlyball<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are only about</font>

417
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:50,400
five of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the country one of</font>

418
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,470
them's in Ann Arbor still but give it a

419
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,820
shot it's great fun you get in these

420
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bumper cars you're raising your</font>

421
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:03,780
hand ah there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Atlanta you could</font>

422
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:07,230
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50th nanog whirly ball game and I</font>

423
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:10,350
could even collect the money for you I'm

424
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:14,010
quite good at that part managing that so

425
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:17,159
I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have many more stories to</font>

426
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:20,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">share there were so many good times it</font>

427
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:24,360
was such a great great experience to be

428
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,570
part of the beginning which was regional

429
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tex it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great to be part of the end</font>

430
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:33,149
of the beginning which was the next

431
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:37,189
