51
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,200
because I were to really dull but I

52
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,690
someone of the merit people was kind

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,880
enough to send me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a note with some of</font>

the breakdown of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the participants and I</font>

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,250
thought this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one was kind of interesting</font>

56
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,958
there were 474 people registered which

57
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,790
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of right in the you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

58
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,040
right within<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standard deviation of</font>

59
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,620
the mean so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's the</font>

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,970
size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good size conference but</font>

61
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">i found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of interesting there</font>

62
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,209
there were 21 countries represented at

63
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,280
nanog the<font color="#E5E5E5"> north american operators group</font>

64
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,780
which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us that you know the</font>

65
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,220
network's kind of a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing even</font>

66
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,500
though we're calling it<font color="#CCCCCC"> north american</font>

67
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,080
network hopper industry and you know

68
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,670
that represented every continent except

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,019
for Antarctica I mean is there no like

70
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,950
is there nobody for men all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

71
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,930
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can stir up</font>

72
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,219
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was kind of interesting</font>

73
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok one more statistical stuff because</font>

74
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,519
this one's kind of interesting so we r

75
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,719
us talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about we want to get new and</font>

76
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,030
young people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our big</font>

77
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,829
things you know to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> an organization</font>

78
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,590
like non-vital you have to have young

79
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,599
people newcomers young people so we

80
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">measured the number of newcomers and it</font>

81
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,170
turns out that we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get about</font>

82
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,239
thirty percent right around you know

83
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,638
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third so this time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

84
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,859
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 28 and change twenty-eight percent</font>

85
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,180
newcomers so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that shows us</font>

86
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,859
that we have new people coming like

87
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,620
there's a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

88
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:06,450
go into that but so it's showing us that

89
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,400
nanog is kind of its pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much alive</font>

90
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,459
and vital so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,950
so that's it for the statistics that's

92
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,659
it that's as far as i could go um I

93
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,380
didn't have any like XL pie charts or

94
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,940
anything um so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing first</font>

95
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,979
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do is thank our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hosts LX pretty awesome conference don't</font>

97
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,690

98
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,690
great

99
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,050
I mean I seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they set a</font>

100
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,760
new standard for what a what a social

101
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,890
event would be with that thing at the

102
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:44,320
aquarium that was awesome so one more

103
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">time that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was great I also want to thank</font>

106
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,630

107
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:58,660
really fun I mean so we held had a good

108
00:04:52,630 --> 00:05:03,400

110
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,909
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people are involved in</font>

111
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,890
pulling this off and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

112
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,690
through just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those um first the</font>

113
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,990
first thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we this is the joint</font>

114
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,790
meeting with Erin and one of the things

115
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did with that we've been doing</font>

116
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,320
recently as we Susan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mark and I and</font>

117
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,610
others on the pc have been getting

118
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,430
together and trying to schedule this

119
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,770
time when we have both both communities

120
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,570
in the room and what we came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

121
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,740
this time was the two panels that we saw

122
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,450
and I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty good I</font>

123
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,890
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really enjoyed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so I</font>

124
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,430
want to thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the people involved</font>

125
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:43,030
with that for that and the Aaron people

126
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,810

128
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,590

129
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,240
the whole thing on and that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

130
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,739
been falling<font color="#E5E5E5"> to merit and I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>
