00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:14,009
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a deep dive into</font>

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,010
topic is submarine systems technology

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,038
trends and coping with relentless demand

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,510
and we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cause of</font>

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> relentless demand so we have as our</font>

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,570
first speaker david ross and david has

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,180
served as in the international

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,280
communication industry since 1970 and he

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,440
started at bell labs with the

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,250
development of technology for undersea

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,910
communication system so he has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30-year</font>

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,570
career into managerial positions at Bell

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,429
Labs AT&T and Tycho and at the end of

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,969
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 year he started his own company</font>

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> David Ross group so for the past 10</font>

18
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">years he's been leading his company his</font>

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,490
his firm's activity has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

23
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:20,729
220 undersea cable networks so we have a

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,919
real expert on our hands so mr. Ross

25
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,229
received his bachelor's and his master's

26

degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the University of Michigan</font>

27
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,110
in Ann Arbor so he's from this community

<font color="#E5E5E5">different talk because while she talked</font>

60
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology itself and focused</font>

61
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:40,280
on hardware and you saw lots of pictures

62
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:43,589
of electro optical equipment and

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,379
undersea repeaters and cable and ships

64
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,450
and so forth and so on I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

65
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">more about the commercial implications</font>

thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can read about to me at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your leisure but i'm going to start</font>

where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start all talks where we start</font>

all business plans where we start all

endeavors in in the world today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

76
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:35,219
is with traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay as when i was</font>

77
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:38,460
learning traffic engineering at AT&T you

78
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,919
know the motto was it all starts with

traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that's true and your</font>

networks today as well as everything we

do today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> today what we're grappling</font>

82
00:04:46,530 --> 00:05:01,559
with more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than ever is relentless</font>

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:02,880
enormous continual growth and back in

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,199
the days when we were tracking voice

85
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,889
traffic and we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talking about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this today at breakfast everything was</font>

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,419
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy it was very predictable that</font>

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:16,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">were very long planning cycles to a</font>

89
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:20,159
certain extent we controlled the timing

90
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:22,990
of when things evolved today we don't

91
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:26,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that control and most of us are</font>

92
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:29,240
struggling<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep up with the</font>

93
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,470
development of the technology and with

the provision of new<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems and network</font>

95
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,750
operators and network owners are

96
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,380
struggling with decisions about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,570
invest their money do the upgrade<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

facilities they have or do they build

new ones those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kinds of</font>

100

questions we're going to be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

101
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:55,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">today but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that drives all of</font>

102
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:58,010
it and this is a slide that I borrowed

103
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,790
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim strong atella geography with</font>

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,730
whom we do a lot of work and they're the

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:08,990
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the primary source for</font>

106
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:12,640
international traffic data and what it

107
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:18,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">shows is that growth has continued</font>

108
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:20,060
unabated for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years but if</font>

109
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,370
you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back three years in three years</font>

110
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,900
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and a decade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

111
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,480
two decades before that you'd see the

112
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:30,229
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of pattern just not quite as</font>

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:35,470
pronounced continual growth and in fact

114
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:43,070
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a worldwide economic downturn</font>

115
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:47,810
demand grew all over the world at a rate

116
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:50,500
that not only kept pace with the period

117
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,960
before the economic<font color="#CCCCCC"> downturn but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact</font>

118
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:59,240
accelerated and this is the world we

119
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:02,020
live in worldwide traffic is growing at

120
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,919
a rate of about sixty percent per year

121
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:10,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the reaction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that of course is to</font>

122
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,400
build more capacity and as it stated on

123
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:18,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide here when it's doubling</font>

124
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:21,020
roughly every 18 months to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 months the</font>

125
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,109
implication of that is that more

126
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,780
capacity is now added in a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

127
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:32,539
than the total that that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in service</font>

128
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,919
two years before so in 2009 in the

129
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,020
international plan

130
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,650
we added about ten terabytes of capacity

131
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:46,919
which is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than what we had in</font>

132
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:51,419
service in 2007 and we're seeing this in

133
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,400
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> region of the world not too long</font>

134
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,000
ago this was confined<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

135
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,690
major markets but as we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending</font>

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,050
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our time connecting places that</font>

137
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:07,440
had never been connected and for my

138
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,200
company that's most of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> endeavor what</font>

139
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,030
we're finding is that every place we go

140
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:16,800
the Middle East Eastern Europe South

141
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:18,510
Asia Africa they're all growing at

142
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,220
phenomenal rates and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

143
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,190
here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in many of these developing</font>

144
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:27,330
areas the rate of growth is well over a

148
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,880

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,779

160

basins and you can see here that there

161
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:27,089
is no place on earth where there has not

162
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,399
been very significant growth some of

163
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,230
this growth is from adding new networks

164
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,910
particularly in places that were

165
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,790
underserved or not connected before and

166
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:41,089
some of it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in the Atlantic</font>

167
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:44,459
has all been with upgrades to existing

facilities and this is the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

177
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:17,250
now in the Atlantic we have the most

178

competitive capacity market on earth and

179
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:23,310
I'm talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> strictly in the</font>

180
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:26,008
international forum here because we have

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:30,089
13 transoceanic cable spans that were

186
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,610

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that whole scenario but the result of</font>

193
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:03,479
2000 so all of the growth has been in

194
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,480
upgrades

195
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,610

199
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,510
period on systems that were by and large

200
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:28,000
developed for a third or two thirds of a

201
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:32,140
terabit and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question continually</font>

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,660
arises when will operators build new

systems and the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an economic</font>

204
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:45,640
one as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a technological one and</font>

it will cover both sides of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now the</font>

206
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,380
thing that's allowed those continual

207
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,770
upgrades is that the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

upgrades has continued to<font color="#CCCCCC"> advance and I</font>

209
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,100
know that you're reaping the benefit of

210
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much in the terrestrial</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the international business it's</font>

213
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,910
nowhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than in the Atlantic</font>

214
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:13,210
and I've shown here what for those of

215
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you who attend technology development</font>

216
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:19,720
conferences is a familiar curve that of

217
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:22,959
the development of capacity on a single

218
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:29,850
fiber in research labs over the past

219
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:33,100
decade and what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is two things</font>

220
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,800
first there has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been continual growth in</font>

221
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,220
the ability to put capacity on a single

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:52,120
growth of the demand itself the

226
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:58,020
implication<font color="#CCCCCC"> being that many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new systems</font>

while upgrades have continually been

out their 10 gigabit plant and replace

like a hundred terabits but the

another generation onto those systems

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,519
and we'll see what pair has to say about

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's that's what we're</font>

various supposed growth rates in the

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:06,800
time most likely given the current

288
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:09,270
growth rate in the 2014-2015 area and

289
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,979
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means is that some systems</font>

292
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,360
be running out of capability earlier

new systems quite soon

295
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,400
now why would somebody build a new

system if they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> upgrade our there</font>

297
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,430
are a number of reasons that people

<font color="#CCCCCC">now after the the downturn in which</font>

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:57,110
there's been a continual decrease in

343

prices and we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all deal</font>

345

348
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:19,009
in the world and operators have argued

349
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:24,320
for many years that they can barely

350
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:26,779
afford a new upgrade channel for their

how they would come up with the capital

355
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:45,649
these systems are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very capital intensive</font>

356
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,469
the average upgrade<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs tens of</font>

the Atlantic the investment for a single

00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,509
strand across the Atlantic is on the

365
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:13,629
order of 200 million dollars so it's

366
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:21,049
it's a big decision and it's being

367
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:25,549
worked against ever falling prices so is

368
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:29,090
it feasible and the answer is yes it's

369
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:31,249
all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers if you have the</font>

370
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation that we have today where</font>

371
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:38,359
demand is growing faster than prices are

372
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:41,899
falling which means that actual revenue

373
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:44,570
is increasing and if the demand is high

374
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:46,639
enough such that for any given operator

375
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,100
the demand

376
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,430
times the market price times their

becoming true that we're breaking even

381
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:13,450
on that calculation so if the present

trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add more capacity in</font>

437
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,410
particular from our perspective how you

have more capacity on existing cables

transatlantic is one area that excels in

452
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,750
terms of total capacity you can also you

453
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,240
look at the areas of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world where</font>

we are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design solutions for</font>

462
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,640
how do you get more bits across these

463
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,460
cables you obviously have to content

464
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,790
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation of a long cable that</font>

465
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,010

466
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,860
and tweak things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a pretty</font>

00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:19,020
firm starting point or playground that

468
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,000
you have to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then beyond</font>

469
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,310
that is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many bits can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get across</font>

470
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,530
a certain spectrum each cable has a

471
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:28,950
certain spectrum that is enabled by the

472
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:32,990
amplifiers on that cable and our job is

473
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:35,820
to try and utilize that the best we can

474
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:38,280
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone about</font>

475
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,490
increasing capacity in the past has been

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,090
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDM so essentially you just sent</font>

477
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,150
the bits faster

478
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,429
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more hits across but there's a</font>

479
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems with that now that we</font>

480
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,440
are reaching into the speeds of 40 gig

481
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,540
and 100 gig and probably above that a

482
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,420
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> components gets very</font>

would like to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially when they</font>

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,280

490

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">not as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good as it was a 10 gigabit and</font>

that has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign implications when</font>

493
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,389
you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy this on a cable</font>

494
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:31,330
that was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed for 10 gig but</font>

495
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:33,040
now you want to run it at 40 or 100 the

496
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,379
point number three that I have here is

497
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,210
the incompatibility with some existing

498
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,700
cables that actually goes more for the

499
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,530
terrestrial side on the terrestrial side

500
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,080
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Road ohms and other filter</font>

501
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:46,270
devices that define a wavelength grip

502
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,220
that you have to be on in the submarine

503
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,220
space we don't have to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

504
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,410
typically we have much more freedom and

505
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,120
as I'll show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> later I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that is</font>

506
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:59,860
going to be our path to even higher

507
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,560
capacities in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future we have</font>

508
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,959
increased sensitivity to chromatic

509
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,760
dispersion so chromatic dispersion is

510
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,470
the effect in fibers that makes

511
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,060
different colours of life propagate at

512
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,430
different times or different speeds

513
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,620
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a bit that</font>

514
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">is sent from one coast to the other the</font>

515
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,429
forefront of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit in the detail of</font>

516
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,960
that bit is going to arrive at different

517
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,190
times just because they travel at

518
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,250
different speeds and that's a huge

519
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem when you go to 40 gig and 100</font>

520
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,650
gig the last one I'm mentioning here is

521
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,600
polarization mode dispersion think about

522
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,420
the chromatic dispersion but now it

523
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,520
depends on how the field is evolving

524
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,980
inside the fibers the fibers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

525
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,840
perfectly round and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means some</font>

526
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,420
light will see different delays

527
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,550
depending on how the path evolves as

528
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,530
it's propagating and now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

529
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,690
mirror image<font color="#E5E5E5"> that arrives at a different</font>

530
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:53,450
time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again creates a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

531
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:56,809
problems as you go to shorter bits

532
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,120
so there are many ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can think</font>

533
00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about upgrading capacity one of them is</font>

534
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,399
as you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see to the right here just</font>

535
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:07,789
using the speeds of the bit make the eye

536
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,189
pattern shorter if you will press more

537
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:11,750
bits into the team time slot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

538
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,269
a lot of other technologies that you can

539
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,010
use as well if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go around clockwise</font>

540
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:19,279
here you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about having</font>

541
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,500
subcarrier multiplexing as we advancing

542
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,299
the technology for optical communication

543
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're actually starting to use a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

544
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:27,950
the technologies that were developed

545
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:30,320
years and years ago for radio

546
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,760
communication we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> now control that in</font>

547
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,820
the optical domain with the frequency

548
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,250
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with they're moving</font>

549
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,039
on further polarization we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

550
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">use that polarization to send signals in</font>

551
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:45,620
both of these polarizations and with

552
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,260
advanced receiver technology we will

553
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,239
choose to receive just the one we want

554
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:53,450
to receive that carries one signal and

555
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,490
we can use the other one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional</font>

556
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,039
capacity effectively doubling the

557
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,929

encoding technologies in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past we</font>

no light it's a sewer if there's light

this field is DSPs you know over the

573
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:43,309
last 10 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSPs have just evolved in</font>

574
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:45,559
phenomenal ways and most of what I'm

575
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:50,149
discussing here is enabled entirely

576
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:52,730
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Diaz piece so I want to step</font>

577
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:55,189
just take one step back and just discuss

578
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,230
encoding technologies a little bit I

579
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:00,260
think it's important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciating</font>

580
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:03,150
how these technologies can help you into

581
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,700
so to the left you see the on-off keying

582
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:09,840
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically that's the lights on for</font>

583
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:12,690
one lights off 40 and you can see the

587
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,110

588
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with intensity and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this 0 is the</font>

594
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:48,450

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chart below you'll see they</font>

actually have the same intensity always

00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:21,440
and the difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

a phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you go around that chart</font>

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,980
every simple that we transmit we now

618
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:56,990
up to higher capacities so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the upper right you will see a bpsk</font>

00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:11,190
essentially what a normal receiver sees

623
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,869
as the signal comes in you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can figure</font>

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what is zeros and what is</font>

625
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:17,980
that is sent into a DSP and that will

626
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:20,529
sort out the different phases of the

627
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,330
signal and it'll decode it back so that

628
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:26,409
you get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea rose and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ones out</font>

629
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:29,889
and below those red and blue clouds you

630
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:33,609
have two distinct clouds 140 and one for

631
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:37,178
once and the same picture repeats itself

632
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:39,539
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> qpsk except after the DSP now you</font>

633
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:43,389
have four<font color="#E5E5E5"> little clouds that each</font>

634
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:47,080
corresponds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pairs of bits that means</font>

635
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:48,729
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we use in qpsk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bpsk we get</font>

636
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,949
a doubling of the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits per</font>

637
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,169
symbol we can do polarization

638
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,239
multiplexing as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

639
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:58,029
that can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us another factor of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

640
00:33:55,239 --> 00:34:00,429
each polarization carries an independent

641
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:03,340
signal so now we up to a factor of four

642
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you can do subcarrier</font>

643
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,658
multiplexing you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack these</font>

644
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,309
spectrums very closely together within a

645
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:11,200
wavelength and you could get another

646
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:14,619
factor too so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a factor of</font>

647
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:17,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight and if you're transmitting 100</font>

648
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:19,629
gigabit signal you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply this factor</font>

649
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:21,579
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight and we can design equipment</font>

650
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:25,540
that propagates as if it was really a

651
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:28,510
12.5 gigabit signal very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to the</font>

653
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:36,879
can get the same propagation

face face modulation is coherent

657
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:51,308
detection and grant detection is very

658
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:52,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">critical for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these benefits what is</font>

659
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:54,879
important to understand about that is

660
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:57,490
that your normal detection detects light

661
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,859
whether it's on and off and it's called

662
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:02,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">a square law detection because you</font>

663
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:04,240
receive light it beats with itself and

664
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get an electrical field out of that</font>

665
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,890
and that's where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your squaring</font>

666
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,690
incoherent detection<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's linear and</font>

667
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,790
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that where we used to do</font>

668
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,160
dispersion compensation and the optical

669
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:17,680
domain that's why you have big spools

670
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,950
sitting in the landing sites to do you

671
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,140
know compensate for the dispersion since

672
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,470
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a linear translation from the</font>

673
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,720
optical to the electrical

00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,310

compensations in the electrical domain

676
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:33,710
and dispersion compensation is very

677
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,320
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the electrical domain it's a</font>

698
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,690
set a margin aside for that with

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,230
corrects for these deficiencies it'll

715
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,030
tell you how big they are right so in

716
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:18,470
every transponder now you have

717
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:20,240
essentially a performance monitor that

718
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:24,230
will sit and say well I had to

719
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,750
temporarily dial-up dispersion and you

720
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,460
can go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see that in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log and that</font>

721
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,109
tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> you well somebody fiddled with</font>

722
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,050
this cable right because there was a

723
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:34,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">change over some minutes and maybe</font>

724
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,650
there's some submarine out there that

725
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:37,310
that found a cable whatever some

726
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,320
fishermen found

727
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,299
it you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the trace because</font>

728
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,580
it had to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the compensation and</font>

729
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,220
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get a readout of what</font>

730
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:54,470
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the real optical domain as</font>

731
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:56,480
low as you can get in the stack so I

732
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:00,200
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out some particular</font>

740
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,390
make good receivers and we can do that

741
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,250
it also means since<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're low powers</font>

742
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,529
they're friendly neighbors for everybody

743
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,030
else on the cable right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means we</font>

744
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:29,540
can pack them very closely together

745
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:32,480
because they don't instigate a lot of

746
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:35,000
nonlinearities that will create problems

747
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,950
for its<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighboring channel so that's a</font>

748
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,840
key for us to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pack these</font>

749
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:44,029

don't have to launch a lot of power we

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,870

00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:07,730
many cases these upgrades are done

760
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:09,680
through these monitoring ports and then

761
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,630
we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide another monitor</font>

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,340
that you you have no effect over the

live with what's in the water and since

00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:46,240
this operates at low power is it's

relatively insensitive to dispersion

775
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,079
what is kind of a funny side effect of

a standard deviation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 0.03 DB very</font>

of a DB and you need to set margin aside

819
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,329
to allow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a normal system if</font>

829
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,660
you can see the one where there's a

arrow pointing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it that says a hundred</font>

00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:25,580
you see two little<font color="#CCCCCC"> peaks in that each of</font>

them effectively contains 50 gigabit of

between a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of 40 gigs just to show</font>

865
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,100
couldn't go in and change the cable but

866
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,690
we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the rodents</font>

867
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,069
with all the filters things that you

00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,820
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal with in a submarine</font>

869
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:10,700
cable and then in 2010 more deployment

870
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:13,190
on 40 gig as well as certification of

871
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,169
hundred gigs upgrades so depending on

872
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:17,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the particulars of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your cable the</font>

873
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,500
distances and so on 40 gig does 60

00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,810
submarines

875
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,360
a a hundred gig is around the corner

876
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:25,549
it's essentially a matter of of the

877
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:30,350
operators asking for it right and

878
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:32,180
wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to invest in them so I'm</font>

879
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,350
probably running out of time but I

880
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted to give you a little bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with phase modulation current detection</font>

883
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:43,070

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,379
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you can do and I'm very</font>

886
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,480
sense that we can't keep up with

887
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:52,009
upgrading cables ultimately I think he's

888
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,970
right but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and stop it</font>

889
00:44:52,010 --> 00:45:00,020
off as much as we can we have 40 gigabit

890
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:03,169
on a 50 gigahertz grid we have a hundred

891
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:06,380
gig on a 50 gigahertz grid and we can

892
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:09,950
see our way<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to doing much more than</font>

893
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:12,260
that getting up towards five or six bits

894
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:15,470
per Hertz which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the measure of</font>

895
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:18,110

896
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:20,689
on on 50 gigahertz grid gives you two

897
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:22,280
bits per Hertz and you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

898
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:29,120
move that up because that's the ultimate

899
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:30,830
capacity that you have on a cable David

900
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,450
talked about how cables have been

901
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:35,060
upgraded already there's some numbers

902
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:37,310
here on a number of cables that have

903
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,799
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed that today are running you</font>

904
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:43,009
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven eight times as much capacity</font>

905
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,780
as they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed for originally so</font>

906
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:49,630
capacity upgrades have taken place

907
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:54,470
already let me just touch on one aspect

908
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:56,300
before finishing up here is that once

909
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:59,270
you have a number of cables it's also

910
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:02,270
critical to use that assembly of cables

911
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:04,790
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most intelligent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way and you can</font>

912
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:06,200
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by creating by meshing them</font>

913
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,090
together essentially switching your

914
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,669
traffic around on the cable so that you

915
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:12,680
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the capacity the best if you</font>

916
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:14,780
have only two cables across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlantic</font>

917
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,370
and one breaks you need to be able to

918
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,130
put all that traffic on the other cable

919
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:21,109
now if you have six crossings like

920
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:24,290
Verizon has in this example that they

921
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:26,600
have described if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have twenty</font>

922
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:28,850
percent extra capacity on all of them if

923
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,170
one of the cables break you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can re-route</font>

924
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:32,600
that to the five other

925
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:34,790
so you need to set much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

926
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,680
smaller fraction of your capacity aside

927
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,720
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> upgrades so it's important to mess</font>

928
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,549
your networks and what we see happening

929
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,669
right now is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the large carrier</font>

930
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:46,730
messing around the world and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity</font>

931
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and changing situations where you have a</font>

932
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:51,680
cable break they will route the critical

933

traffic the latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 intensive traffic</font>

934
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,870

935
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,670
capacity that's not so latency intensive

936
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:01,190
maybe goes around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other world around</font>

937

the other way around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world those are</font>

941
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:12,190
terrestrial cables will fade over time

942
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'll be one big network but</font>

943
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:15,920
technologies will differ a little but

944
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:20,530
even that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is coming together</font>

945
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,530
to create one global network thank you

946
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:59,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay right I've been asked to sort of</font>

947
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:03,490
kick off a discussion session on

948
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:07,779
upgrades versus new builds with a

949
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:10,299
suggestion for an analytical way to to

950
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:15,119
look at when one might choose to build

951
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:15,119
rather than rather than upgrading and

952
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:22,049
for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who aren't accustomed</font>

953
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:26,470
to to looking at this kind of a diagram

954
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:30,910
this is a plot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the incremental cash</font>

955
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:32,259
flow the investment and return on an

956
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,118
undersea system now this is a

particular system but what it shows you

959
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:44,680
is the very large negative cash flow

960
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:47,079
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes place when you first build</font>

money before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you collect a diamond</font>

situation very quickly when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you turn the</font>

967
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:08,559
system on and then slowly because the

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,940
demand continues to increase faster than

969
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:18,029
the prices fall typically the

970
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:20,589
year-over-year the revenue will increase

971
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:22,839
until the system has been in<font color="#CCCCCC"> service for</font>

972

a number of years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there are</font>

things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen out here and this is</font>

974
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:29,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">where you start to encounter some very</font>

975
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:32,500
serious need for upgrades because the

976
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:36,880
demand is growing exponentially and you

977
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:40,569
have to choose between building in

978
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,880
investing in those upgrades or building

979
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:47,038
a new system which<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give you a lot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">more potential for new capacity and</font>

among the things that happen out here

00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:57,309
are number one the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> prices continue</font>

983
00:49:53,140 --> 00:50:01,328
to fall and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a kind of a</font>

984

downturn there you may run<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

further and then there's a there's a

third factor that's more of a

993

1002
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:54,529
once a system gets to be seven eight

a new system and so the market share<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:10,579
existing systems tends to drop and so in

1018

00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:57,799

that's sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commercial view and</font>

1034
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,640
were talking about performance being

1035
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,250
worse at higher speeds and it showed

1036
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,859
seventy percent loss or something at 10

1037
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:39,380
gigs and me at forty and ninety percent

1038
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:47,020
loss it<font color="#CCCCCC"> one hundred and what is that</font>

1039
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:50,270
loss exactly be does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no work</font>

1040
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:53,900
so the reference that was made there is

1041
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:56,210
the to the simple fact that to receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1042
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:59,270
bit you essentially need the same energy

1043
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:03,950
everything else equal in a receiver so

1044
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:06,080
when you go from 10 gig to 40 gig the

1045
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,980
average power that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need is four</font>

1046
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:11,240
times as high so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> six DB</font>

1047
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:15,410
disadvantage that you get when you move

1048
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:17,299
from 10 to 100 gig you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times as</font>

1049
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:19,819
much power because you have the same

1050
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:22,100
energy per bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 times as many bits</font>

1051
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that gives you a tend to be penalty</font>

1052
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:27,160
overall so that's what it the references

1053
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,160

David can can add to this most likely as

1070
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:18,470
well i'll give you my<font color="#E5E5E5"> impression of that</font>

1071
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:21,019
is that the cables are you know first of

1072
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:24,618
all generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> left alone in the sea so</font>

1073
00:54:21,019 --> 00:54:27,410
that helps them they do hang on riches

1074
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:30,799
and so on and come in contact with rocks

1075
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:34,069
and so forth at the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> and currents</font>

1076
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:35,839
can cause some disruption<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1077
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:37,759
typically the interruptions are more

1078
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,220
from very sudden events like earthquakes

1079
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:44,210

first undersea cables fiber-optic cables

1085

were installed only in 1988 so there

isn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long history with these</font>

1088
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:17,920
installed you know their cables are

1089
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:20,430
still very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much intact and the sea</font>

1090
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,220
bottom is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a benign place</font>

1091
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:28,120
cables tend to lie directly on the

1092

bottom if the if the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> is soft</font>

1093
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:34,630
they'll actually kind of bury themselves

1094
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:37,990
in the seabed and they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1095
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:41,220
disturbed by very much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> pair mentioned</font>

1096
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:44,200
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a possibility of having</font>

00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:59,470
they've gone beyond their economic life

1102
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:01,150
in their original intention they're

1103
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:06,089
being pulled up and redeployed in other

1104
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:13,150
places seemingly without loss of

1105

performance so Jeff the effector talked

1106
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,690
about is called strumming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cable kind of ships back in the</font>

1108
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:20,230
late strumming is one of the wonderful

1109
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,760
things I can have but I'm a little

1110
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:24,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprised at some of the assertions with</font>

1111
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,200
the lay press because as you probably

1112
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,359
know desktop studies are pretty

1113
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,430
extensive when you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy a cable</font>

1114
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,290
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do a fairly intensive study</font>

1115
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:36,490
of the ocean bottom and you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like avoid volcanic or geological</font>

1117
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:40,120

everything collapsed in on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1121
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:48,670
cables I've actually I'm not familiar

1122
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:51,010
with cables hanging over ridges as well

1123
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,600
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the effect of the weight</font>

over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i appreciate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1126
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,530
reference point on that but can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

1127
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,840
me how many wet systems are currently

1128
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:04,930
how many 40 gig systems are wet right

1129
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,880
now and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many might be an ITP and I</font>

1130
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:09,100
TP is intent to proceed basically

1131
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,360
there's an agreement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the cables</font>

continue they provide some money to fund

00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,540
materials purchase and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the deal</font>

1135
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:23,009
gets the old and they go into play the

1136
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:26,170
cable I think as as I said in my talk

1137
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:29,740
there are no 40 gigabit systems in

that have bits running it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 gigabits</font>

1152
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:14,529
that where they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got 40 gigabit</font>

1153
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:17,320

available they're out there

1165
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:56,380
demonstrating via upgrades that the

1166
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,340
technology will work the laboratory

1167
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:02,680
demonstrations that they have reportedly

1168
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:04,390
but no one can point to a system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1169
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,940
they've deployed that that's in and

1173
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:16,578
me just add one comment to that is that

1174
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:18,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">as we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about there's no cables</font>

1175
00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:21,349
that were designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a 40 gig cable</font>

1176
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:24,470
yet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> David is talking</font>

1177
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:26,569
about the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put up was intended to</font>

1178
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:29,540
show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are 40 gig</font>

1179
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:32,540
wavelengths running<font color="#CCCCCC"> undersea since 2008</font>

1180
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,130
carrying commercial traffic so it's way

1181
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,619
beyond the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage of laboratory</font>

1182
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:40,099
experiments and demos and things like

1183
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:42,740
that the the fact of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business is</font>

1184
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:45,650
that you often don't get to deploy until

1185
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,270
you have done demos and trials and often

1186
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,859
customers are more willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1187
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,200
share some of that information that

1188
00:59:48,859 --> 00:59:53,119
natural deployments and I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1189
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,040
share names but on some of these

1190
00:59:53,119 --> 01:00:02,690
deployments but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just are not allowed</font>

1191
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:04,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh thank you everyone the undersea</font>

1192
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:06,349
cable world is always fascinating to me

1193
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:08,328
I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy listening to these talks</font>

1194
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:10,700
even though I know I'm never going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1195
01:00:08,329 --> 01:00:12,109
lay an underground underwater fiber and

1196
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,290
I'm just as<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad that I'm not going to</font>

1197
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,290
