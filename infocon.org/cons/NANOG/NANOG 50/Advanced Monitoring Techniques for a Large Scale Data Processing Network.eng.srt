problems and solutions and fun that

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,949
we've had building the data network for

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,240
Collider at CERN in Geneva and the team

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,920
is rather hoping that some of our

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,470
experiences and solutions will be of

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,090
interest to you guys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world</font>

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,820
here the Atlas experiment itself is very

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,829
very large if you look across at the I

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,840
can't see whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> co sees these small</font>

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,899
it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it produces lots</font>

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,660
and lots of data<font color="#CCCCCC"> it weighs a great deal</font>

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,780
and the picture on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top right shows</font>

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,750
you the kind of reconstructed image that

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,850
the detector produces once the data has

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,219
all been sent out and reconstructed in

24
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,060
80 terabytes per second which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,090

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,729
triggers to reduce it down to something

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,770
slightly more usable which is what we

28
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,369
start to see it ethernet level arrives

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,460
at 160 gigabytes per second we look

30
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,350
basically a partial events so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,509
gigabytes per second of this goes to

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,229
about four or five hundred not 200

33
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,640
processors and then we give the thumbs

34
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,710
up or down as to whether or not they're

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,500
interesting and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next level will then</font>

36
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,689
fetch the entire event to come down and

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,490
there we've send it out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 22</font>

38
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,798
thousand processors<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again we give</font>

39
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,929
the thumbs up or thumbs down and we cut

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,299
it down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a manageable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 400 megabytes a</font>

41
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,640
second which goes out the magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

42
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,890
about that is it's about the limit that

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,990
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> record onto disk before</font>

44
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,759
sending it out on the grid to the rest

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,110
of the world any<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,360
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not enough computers left</font>

47
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,100
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world to do the analysis because</font>

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,049
don't forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us there's</font>

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,369
further experiments doing the same thing

50
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,890
in real time around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data flow part</font>

51
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,449
we put the control structure and around

52
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,949
that eventually when the build-out is

53
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,420
finished we'll put our monitoring at the

54
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,980
moment

55
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,140
run it over the control structure but

56
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,599
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> things start to get really busy</font>

57
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,089
then will migrate outwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font>

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,700
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a total of about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8500</font>

59
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,590
ports in this system we also have a

60
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,410
small problem we have demanding

61
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,870
customers just like you guys do the

62
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">network was dimension to meet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called</font>

63
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,700
requirements so we cunningly built it

64
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,170
larger than we were asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we</font>

65
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,060
would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a maximum average link</font>

66
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,280
occupancy of less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than sixty percent</font>

67
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,450
which meant that at least in the plan

68
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we would go home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sleep</font>

69
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,670
peacefully at night unfortunately this

70
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,650
is actually seen as a challenge by the

71
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,510
physicists because to them sixty percent

72
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,819
occupancy means they got forty percent

73
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,880
for free and so what they will normally

74
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:57,649
do is just turn up the wick until you

75
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,630
saturate something something breaks and

76
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,760
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they back off just slightly so</font>

77
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,359
you're running permanently at maximum

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,149
demand so now we can't distinguish

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore between what are real problems</font>

80
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,860
because we're oversubscribed somewhere

81
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,730
or rather than to subscribe somewhere

82
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,290
and the self-inflicted injuries and we

83
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,410
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do this to protect</font>

84
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,358
ourselves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also to help the community</font>

85
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,310
get the best out of the system and the

86
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:28,070
only way we can accomplish<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

87
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,769
basically by monitoring everything so

88
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,140
what what is out there well we did the

89
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,700
the easy thing we looked around what was

90
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,890
doing in what was being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

91
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,720

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,488
associates spectrum they've used it for

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,650
10 20 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now they're quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with</font>

94
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:45,739
it and it really is good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for tracking</font>

95
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,540
component failures we discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

96
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,299
quickly however that's a very good

97
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">system it takes all of the data it</font>

98
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,489
stores it very very very well and then

99
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:58,760
hides it from you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble there is</font>

100
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even at a fairly low polling</font>

101
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,569
intervals of about five minutes the

102
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,150
report gateway is already a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if</font>

103
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,858
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a drop for any time we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

104
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,019
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the system to catch up just to</font>

105
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:10,940
find out what's been going on and we

106
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:13,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered to our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs that there's no</font>

support<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all if we want to poll at</font>

108
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,918
less than five minute intervals and we

109
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,930
were thinking more like a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds</font>

110
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if a query made a compromise and we</font>

111
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,410
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this at 30-second</font>

112
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,380
intervals

113
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,510
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we almost</font>

114
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,570
immediately ran into a block because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

115
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,159
discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the we were getting</font>

polling drops as you can see in the

117
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,390
graph at the bottom the system would

118
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,250
just sort of give up and go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lunch</font>

119
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,450
CA did what they could but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

120
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,820
they said you know when you're running

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,930
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that speed you're on your own but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

122
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">from our point of view we couldn't</font>

123
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,620
accept five minutes because it's been

124
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,060
used in a feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop nobody's going</font>

125
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change a parameter and then wait five</font>

126
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,660
minutes to see what the hell's going on

127
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so he said no we have to have the</font>

128
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,270
speed and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out what the</font>

129
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,940
problem was we essentially ended up

130
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,680
writing our own polling engine so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

131
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,300
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it was second guessing what</font>

132
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,880
spectrum was doing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to find out</font>

133
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,070
what the root of the problem was and we

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,659
did in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact find it but by that time we</font>

135
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,580
had a wonderful polling engine which is

136
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,980
fastness reliable it works there's no

137
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,260
drops and the good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

138
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,060
point of view is that it takes all of

139
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and it stores it both in an</font>

inland database and<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disc for rrd</font>

141
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,219
files so that all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want right</font>

142
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,859
here and right now is in memory which

143
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,140
makes a visualization really easy we

144
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,700
solved the bug it was an interesting one

145
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,190
it may amuse you one of the earliest

grade software in the edge switches he's

148
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:44,320
absolutely right what happened is in

149
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:47,470
this instance was that SNMP request to

150
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,599
the switches will were provided were

151
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,840
being responded to in some particular

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,070
cases by delays and these delays were

153
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,810
coming from switches which had chunks

154
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,400
enabled in the switches and the delays

156
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,109
matter and the delays could be anything

157
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">from one up to five seconds now</font>

159
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,680
file spectrum concerned was a bit like

160
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,090
mah GERD on it went to sleep and it

161
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,980
would wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> as some time in the future</font>

162
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,049
whenever it felt like it and they never

163
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what that was but at least</font>

164
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:23,440
HP fix their problem given the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

165
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,270
we were over running therefore what the

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,180
spectrum support we had to reconsider

167
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,150
our options sorry going the wrong way

168
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,680
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided we put spectrum one side</font>

169
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">will keep it for what its good at which</font>

170
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,139
is failure alarms we looked at cacti

171
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font>

174
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,430
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get in a plug-in which</font>

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,770
will do multiple overlays of plots but

176
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it can't handle on our our DS and it</font>

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,330

178
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,748
can't use it with an external discovery

179
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,508
so we gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> that up buried inside Cathy</font>

00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,460
in fact his spine which is a very stable

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast polo and if we'd known that</font>

182
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,049
then we would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have used this</font>

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,120
for our own<font color="#CCCCCC"> poll engine and added our</font>

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,550
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good product but for the to meet</font>

186
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,549
the monitoring everything we also need

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,250
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about the host CPU stats so sis</font>

188
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,529
admins had decided a long time ago they

189
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">were going to use nagios they'd looked</font>

190
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:26,270
at lemon it was fairly it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

191
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,460
very flexible so my guess was their

192
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,240
choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately it has poor plot</font>

193
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,549
visualization at least the instance of

194
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,900
it that we have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> CERN does pulling</font>

195
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,139
plots out of nagios is a bit like

196
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,969
watching paint dry we also wanted as

197
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,779
fellow<font color="#E5E5E5"> collectors you can buy an airflow</font>

198
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:46,279
collector they're not cheap but the and

199
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:48,409
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they don't do proper date</font>

200
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,139
data archiving and we wanted archiving

201
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,719
so for post-mortem analysis and we

202
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,029
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd also need something for</font>

203
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,620
environmental stats because there's no

204
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:59,270
point getting excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

205
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,430
switches dying if it turned out some

206
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,568
clowns<font color="#CCCCCC"> turned the power off and</font>

207
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,569
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

208
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,279
environment starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> further for that and</font>

209
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,889
so you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here already we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a large</font>

210
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,080
selection of data sources for monitoring

211
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,689
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we pull it all together well</font>

212
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,849
what I want is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shopping because</font>

213
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:18,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I don't want is multiple interfaces</font>

214
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:21,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have to learn it and train people how</font>

215
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:24,080
to use so how do the pros do it well

216
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,469
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the spectrum visualization here</font>

217
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,378
and at the top left you've got the auto

represent to our users the architectures

them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works the problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

if you actually do an edit of any of

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> components the whole thing</font>

collapses and you get the pictures on

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top right if you add to that the</font>

233
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,388
fact that you can't overlay traffic onto

234
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:07,860
the links basically it's really not

235

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want and we had to look</font>

236
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,339
elsewhere we pretty soon came back on a

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,180
you can overlay the the traffic volume

as a color code onto the links and in

00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,509
that out to the users so that people on

267

shift could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good idea that their</font>

00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,379
ears but at least the network was

270
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,059
perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy and so we came to the</font>

271
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,009
architecture of the final system where

272
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,860
at the bottom you see our SNMP polling

273
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:44,040
engine we have a set of databases which

274
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,529
are central and all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our other systems</font>

275
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,029
feed into these databases and on the top

276
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,800
we have the various visualization

277
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,050
packages which feed off of the databases

278
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,990
and so we look forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a nice quiet</font>

279
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,949
easy time while we develop this ready

cooling system but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have a</font>

287
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,370
power failure in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer room so</font>

288
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,860
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened is things got very hot</font>

289
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,390
very quickly in our in the

290
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,250
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> room that we have</font>

291
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,480
temperatures<font color="#E5E5E5"> were rising about one</font>

292
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,340
degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> % 1 degree centigrade per minute</font>

293
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,990
and so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you have a</font>

294
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,230
problem like that is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a tested</font>

295
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">fail-safe plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and clearly we didn't we</font>

296
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,620
dropped the ball on that when everybody

297
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,969
thought somebody else had done it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in</font>

298
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,590
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> the monitoring worked perfectly</font>

299
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,320
it's getting hot it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting real hot</font>

300
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,530
it's awfully hot in here guys and nobody

301
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,620
noticed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> about an hour the</font>

302
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,180
post-mortem was interesting and there's

303
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,070
a word of warning to you guys as well

304
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,500
the very first thing to fail was the

305
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:56,550
fiber links they go at about 40 to 45

306
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">degrees ambient and therefore if you've</font>

307
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,589
got yourself mission-critical links you

308
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,880
better have a copper back up someplace

309
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:06,060
nobody actually expected that we would

310
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,520
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit this kind of this kind of</font>

311
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,369
problem because Intel's got all this

312
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,380
nice thermal management problem and if

313
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">things get hot then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it skipped cycles</font>

314
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,420
and eventually will stop working

315
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,530
altogether and that's true if the

316
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,599
motherboard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're living on</font>

317
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,420
allows it to and our vendor had

318
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,980
suppressed all that so these would run

319
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,449
at a hundred percent until he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

320
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:32,220
in flames we also got fan controls which

321
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,460
is supposed to speed up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> increase the</font>

322
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,920
the cooling as things get one and they

323
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,990
would have if sysadmin hadn't discovered

324
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,990
earlier that if you run the fans at full

325
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,090
speed the vibration on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the motherboard</font>

326
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,220
causes the head<font color="#E5E5E5"> bounce on the disk which</font>

327
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,620
means that latency goes up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

328
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,940
use it as a file server so they cut the

329
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,740
speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate really down so that the</font>

330
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">latency would be fine routers they've</font>

331
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,510
got a nice cut they've got a nice system

332
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,730
for load shedding when things get hot it

333
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,140
never worked because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power supplies</font>

334
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,380
and the fans went long before that

335
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,670
kicked in beware of ups if you have ups

336
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,560
in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> room then you also</font>

337
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,349
need an uninterruptible<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooling supply</font>

338
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,359
we didn't have one and the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font>

339
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,970
just about<font color="#CCCCCC"> sa messes we had a</font>

340
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,730
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> system of smss put not your</font>

341
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,690
trust in this one guy was asleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

342
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,730
other guy his inbox was full my machine

343
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,960
was charging in the kitchen and in any

344
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,550
case it didn't matter because the

345
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,290
messages were too long for the buffer

346
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,349
and you couldn't read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> magic numbers</font>

347
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,610
that you needed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we judge we</font>

348
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,850
dodged a bullet on that one because

349
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:43,230
things did come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to life p I need a</font>

350
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,790

<font color="#E5E5E5">opening panel of our network browser</font>

352
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,110
which gives us an overall system summary

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,890
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first time I'm seeing what I</font>

354
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,930
really want excuse me because here we

355
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,590
have the architecture laid out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

356
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">see at a glance all the various profiles</font>

357
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,310
are all looking roughly the same except

358
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom which is burst</font>

transmission out to the system

360
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,410
everything is fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for the first</font>

361
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I have an overall picture of what</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I go back inside but</font>

363
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,210
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just the core I don't see</font>

364
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,550
house what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want when we looking at</font>

365
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">a house well every tool will produce a</font>

366
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,479
single plot it's usually auto scaled and

367
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,860
we're interested in that of course but

368
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,840
we also want to see the load as a

369
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,510
percentage of capacity because as I said

370
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,430
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a capacity quite often and</font>

371
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,430
we're also interested in the discards to

372
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,709
see how hard TCP is working and we'd

373
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,050
love to see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them overlaid</font>

374
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,520
together so we can collect set of peers

375
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:43,920
and see if they are all pulling the

376
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:46,439
weight correctly and so we do this we've

377
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,300
integrated this into into our work panel

378
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,250
and I like to spend a few minutes just

379
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking through this system here with</font>

380
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,840
you I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on the slide over</font>

381
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,489
here so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to those are on the</font>

left<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to have to have a problem</font>

383
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:02,280
here here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have our aggregated overlay</font>

384
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,469
which shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the instance of the</font>

385
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular peer group that we chose from</font>

386
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:11,130
the menu here and in the mini<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the sub</font>

387
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,990
menus here we see many plots which will

388
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,000
display any of the parameters that we

389
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,120
want typically we would put load here

390
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,850
errors there and the auto scaled version

391
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:25,310
so we see something if anything

392
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:27,880
is going on the display itself is based

393
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:31,008
on it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time slot that we see here</font>

394
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've chosen the most you the the most</font>

395
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:35,810
useful peer groups here but if we wanted

396
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to cut things down and filter it even</font>

397
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,589
more than we can put in a regular

398
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,920
expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here and this is the route</font>

399
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:45,110
look and feel of our system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

400
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,019
particular case we're pulling<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

401
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,540

402
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,910
window is this one up here which tells

403
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,029
us which database will be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at so</font>

404
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,469
we can now change that and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

405
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,660
we're not going to pull up the the s

406
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,970
flow statistics and so we have this

407
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,230
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same look and look and feel</font>

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the s flow of course he's going to</font>

409
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell us not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a question of how much</font>

410
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,050
traffic there is but who's doing what to

411
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,839
who and why which will help us with

412
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:14,240
debugging and by again changing this

413
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,209
time we're looking at the statistics for

414
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU system and in the mini plots</font>

415
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,859
here we can pull out any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usual</font>

we want to know about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host cpus and</font>

419
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,399
we can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for any of the class of</font>

the processes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see there and it's</font>

421
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,649
the same look and feel and then the we

422
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:39,529
can also then pull in the environmental

423
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:43,009
stats<font color="#E5E5E5"> just by and again it's the same</font>

430
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,149
dynamic pages with real-time traffic

431
00:16:56,569 --> 00:17:01,759
everyone does those<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going to</font>

good for seeing switch to switch traffic

435
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,220
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I explained do we can't</font>

436
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,500
incorporate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host details the browser</font>

437
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,079
which I've just walked through will give

438
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,309
you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hoes details but you have to</font>

439
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,470
dig for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you have to know what</font>

440
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,149
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for and you have to be</font>

441
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much of an expert to understand</font>

442
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,740
what it is that you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> even then</font>

443
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:26,239
but i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the detail when</font>

444
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,390
something goes wrong because what we're

445
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,530
dealing here with is is a process there

446
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,030
is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a factory automation</font>

447
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,129
system if we

448
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,690
garbage out at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom I don't want</font>

449
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,340
to spend my<font color="#E5E5E5"> time on that because the</font>

450
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,560
odds are<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's come from garbage in</font>

451
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,000
at the top so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on where</font>

452
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,950
the real problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and for that I need</font>

453
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,990
to correlate things that are going on

454
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,090
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire system and when it is</font>

455
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">going wrong I want to see the neighbors</font>

456
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,110
to see if it's an isolated case or if

457
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,260
there's a whole class of devices that

458
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">are in a problem and when I look at this</font>

459
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,379
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see a different view in a</font>

460
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,660
different different level of detail

461
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,280
depending on my viewpoint how the level

462
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,230
of abstraction that I'm comfortable with

463
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,550
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to fly through it</font>

464
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,650
because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff out there</font>

465
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,270
and I want navigation visible eres it's

466
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,670
all about musics what I want right

467
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,650
because what I really want is Google

468
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,600
Earth in my network right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

469
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,910
tried it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I built a network the size of</font>

470
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,280
Greenland but it wasn't very practical

471
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,290
because the coordinate<font color="#CCCCCC"> system is based</font>

472
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,410
on geography and it's not based on logic

473
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,240
so and in those<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> li you couldn't</font>

474
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,920
do dynamic update requirements so we

475
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,710
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for some display software</font>

476
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,190
that would do this and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle of</font>

477
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:36,800
choice is<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3d which is an enhanced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vrml</font>

478
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,510
it comes with a freebie viewer and it's

479
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:43,940
free for a reason it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

480
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:46,180
all and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went looking for something</font>

481
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would handle up to a million</font>

482
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,260
simultaneous instances and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it</font>

483
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,510
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> October player and this is the view</font>

484
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,250
that now we have constructed so the

485
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:58,430
green circle in the background is our

486
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,950
control plane and brought in the to the

487
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">foreground is the the furniture which</font>

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,430
are the main architectural structures

489
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,800
it's the farms of processes in the

490
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:10,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">square boxes and it's the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core</font>

the at this top level were your see in

495
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,180
these aggregates of all of the traffic

496
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:26,600
that's going from one of these building

497
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:29,810
blocks to another if i was to zoom in at

498
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,929
the for example the center core here

499
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:35,690
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see windows here</font>

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,680
receiving a lot and underneath<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

bars of weathering

505
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,830
we're in the state of happiness or

506
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,070
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something wrong and we ought to</font>

507
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:52,860
worry about it and if i zoom in even

508
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:56,129
closer then you have this nice little

509
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,050
icon here which is a graphing icon and

510
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,870
this will pull up any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the statistics</font>

511
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> structure that I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

512
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,090
at so i can pull out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system any</font>

513
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,590
of the particular ports any i can pull

514
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,050
out all of the stats that you've seen

515
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,990
before whether its environmental traffic

516
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:16,919
or whatever it's all there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

517
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:20,640
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it in detail if we fly into one</font>

518
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:23,450
of the inclined to one of the big big

519
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,120
computer rooms<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this top-level</font>

520
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,830
picture here is the distance view and we

521
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,959
have an amphitheater of racks of

522
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,879
equipment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see instantly the</font>

523
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,120
moment I walk in or fly into this room

524
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,790
that there's one or two or three racks

525
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,530
which are showing some high level of

526
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,960
activity this isn't a simulation by the

527
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,520
way this was done during Saturday

528
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,870
night's run and it was emailed to me

529
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,820
over the while I was here and I can see

530
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,669
that there's some areas here which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font>

531
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,470
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit congested so I can fly in and</font>

532
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> then gives me the second picture</font>

533
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and now you're seeing the the</font>

534
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,560
detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all the individual processes</font>

535
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,930
as I'm beginning to see the windows

536
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,659
there and at the bottom I've flown right

537
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:08,250
in and I can look at one specific

538
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:12,510
processor and say well are you having a

539
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:15,300
nice day or not yeah so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion I</font>

540
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,490
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you the video of how</font>

541
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:21,139
this works if only I could get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

542
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,140
to work for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a look</font>

543
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,190
I may need to resize this<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I may need</font>

544
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,190
to kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

545
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,240
while I'm plane you can think about

546
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,240
questions

547
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is a screen capture that</font>

548
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,799
was done over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weekends run as well</font>

549
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:14,509
just a couple of seconds there to see

550
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,789
the view so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just flown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in to look at</font>

551
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:18,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">the core everything is fine there you're</font>

552
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:20,570
noticing up at the top here there's some

553
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">slight congestion there it is yellow</font>

554
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,039
it's not red here we have some

555
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:27,469
congestion in the xpu farms the rest of

556
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,119
the system seems fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's go and</font>

557
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:33,139
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look up in here so we fly into</font>

558
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">this area there and immediately you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

559
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:37,279
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is the guy that's got the</font>

560
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem so you fly into him and it's one</font>

561
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,549
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sub detectors which is putting</font>

562
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:42,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">out a little bit more data than we would</font>

563
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:45,408
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so we pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the the plots and</font>

564
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:47,418
we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's nothing terrible it's</font>

565
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:50,059
that we can ask the guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they're</font>

566
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:53,359
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out more than they normally did</font>

567
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:55,129
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's not fatal data</font>

568
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,958
taking will go on perfectly happy like

569
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:59,359
this let's go and see what the

570
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:01,579
repercussions of that are so we fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

571
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,708
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room here we have these icons</font>

572
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:05,690
there we discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> when navigating in</font>

573
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:09,859
3d it's very easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get yourself lost</font>

574
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:12,169
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we needed a quick way home to</font>

575
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:14,649
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we recognized and this is</font>

576
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:18,190
flying<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the the XP you from the</font>

577
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:20,958
<font color="#CCCCCC">third level processing farm here's the</font>

578
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,969
here's the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flying into</font>

579
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:24,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you see how the detail is</font>

580
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:26,869
increasing as we're getting in towards

581
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,549
it and then we see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font>

582
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:33,468
everything is fine because this is the

583
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:35,509
receive of the top of rack switch and

584
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:37,190
it's completely and utterly saturated

585
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:38,989
which means we can't do any better than

586
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing at the moment which is fine</font>

587
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:43,940
so everybody's happy TCP is working its

588
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:45,619
guts out keeping up with it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

589
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,419
cannot do any more than we're doing and

590
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:50,168
so it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem at all</font>

591
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,169
thank you very much

592
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:59,549
thanks Brian we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

593
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,769
please do announce yourselves so we know

who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so Tim Brown cisco systems</font>

595
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:06,539
just to really quick questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you</font>

596
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:08,070
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system side it</font>

597
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,450
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're doing a lot of polling</font>

598
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,009
as opposed to messaging was there a

599
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,950
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that decision or are you in</font>

600
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:15,929
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing more messaging based back to</font>

602
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:19,980
for that what was your rationale behind

603
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,450
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> that approach versus trying to</font>

604
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,070
message the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day because it seems like in</font>

605
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,440
more large-scale implementations that

606
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,879
that I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see or look at I see a</font>

607
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people kind of shifting to a</font>

608
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:30,689
messaging based approach where the host

609
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:33,029
themselves are the elements themselves

610
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,710
kind of message yeah in one of the other

611
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:36,149
experiments they did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

612
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,820
have tighter control over the

613
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:41,518
applications they've instrumented the

614
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:45,059
transport layer software and they've

615
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:48,869
gone that route we are slightly more of

616
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:50,820
a individualistic shall i say experiment

617
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:54,389
we are dealing with physicists here not

618
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:56,309
company men sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh so there there was</font>

619
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:59,488
no possibility whatsoever to instrument

620
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:00,690
the the application level they were

621
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:02,580
desperately trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font>

622
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:06,239
work just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be ready on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time let alone</font>

623
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:09,449
do subtle things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we</font>

624
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:11,669
were put into a defensive situation and

625
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,080
therefore we<font color="#CCCCCC"> polled everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

626
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:16,320
in fact it's very very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

627
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,029
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this system we spot anomalous</font>

628
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,649
things that the application guys aren't

629
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:23,580
aware of for example we see linear

630
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:25,168
growth intra in in traffic the

631
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,730
application guys completely unaware of

632
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:28,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">it because he has a bug in his system</font>

633
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,970
he's reporting back statistics to

634
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,470
somebody and instead of instead of

00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:41,999
him everything is fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network will</font>

638
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,230
eventually fall over however right the

639
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,639
second question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was looking at your</font>

640
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,649
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools that you investigated</font>

641
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:48,629
earlier in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deck and one tool</font>

642
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:49,949
I didn't see on there and it doesn't

643
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:52,259
didn't surprise me but I was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

644
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,789
surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it hasn't received more</font>

645
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,769
attention from the operational community

646
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:58,679
is a tool called graphite which I

647
00:25:55,769 --> 00:26:00,600
believe portions of it were talked about

648
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,190
at google recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what</font>

649
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,769
they're using it for if they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

650
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,029
but did you look at graphite at all or

651
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:08,369
no we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

652
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:10,169
they seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of problems in</font>

653
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:13,228
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traditional rd based</font>

654
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:15,269
approach see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom line was we were</font>

655
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:17,340
up against<font color="#E5E5E5"> rock and a hard place this</font>

656
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:19,619
business with spectrum took a year to

657
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,059
get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of it right just</font>

658
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,459
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> we tried every known</font>

659
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:25,259
combination and eventually we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

660
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,599
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and said look we really have</font>

661
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:30,090
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deliver something yeah and I</font>

662
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,889
hadn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even gotten any press except</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

663
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,968
like the past month or so so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

664
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:38,488
this this was all being put together

665
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:40,440
started about two years ago and the the

666
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:43,950
data came online about a year ago for

667
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,169
the first time reasonably heavily so we

668
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,669
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of luxury to go tour</font>

669
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:55,669
the market great thanks very much

670
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:59,609
occasion morning Wes<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard occur Sparta</font>

671
00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:03,179
I'm a big fan of visualization I'm a big

672
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:04,859
fan of graphs the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've</font>

673
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,239
had a hard time with over the years is

674
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:08,879
that I keep falling in and out of

675
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:10,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually using it and I think that comes</font>

676
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:12,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">from mostly from an operational kind of</font>

677
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:14,369
sense for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you can spend all of your</font>

678
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:15,960
time playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> around in and zooming in</font>

679
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,039
and out of things and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had spend</font>

680
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,749
all of your time doing that and you get

681
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,339
nothing else done and then I fall back

682
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:21,989
into you know working in the real world

683
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,668
and and looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the nitty-gritty</font>

684
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:26,129
all the time and I forget about my

685
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:29,399
visualization tools and so some of my

686
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:32,639
question I think is a how long has this

687
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:34,859
been in production and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much have you</font>

688
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:38,339
used it and can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me a real world</font>

689
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:40,499
feedback for is you know how much of

690
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">your day time in fact you've been</font>

691
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:44,609
looking at this versus you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

692
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:47,399
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> other data it's a really cool system</font>

693
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:49,109
I'm very impressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

694
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,059
number of aspects to this and I

695
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:53,249
sympathize<font color="#E5E5E5"> and agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it with a</font>

696
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:57,049
number of your points the workhorse is

697
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:59,759
the the multi-window browser and that

698
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:01,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's one main user of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs me</font>

699
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:05,279
and it sucks up about two hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

700
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:07,228
life every every morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it's</font>

701
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,259
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant for the for the long haul in</font>

702
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:13,049
the sense that I intend to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of my life the the database</font>

704
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:17,460
structure that we have is a platform

705
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:18,940
onto which we will put an expert system

706
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,680
which will<font color="#CCCCCC"> then dig</font>

707
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,810
into there and pull the interesting

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,169
so I need the visualization tool so it

711
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,389
can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable with knowing what the</font>

712
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,670
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> really looks like as it is</font>

713
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,020
operating what they call normally which

714
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,720
is in fact it goes through an order

715
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:41,080
magnitude every few minutes as things

716
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,820
evolve as for the 3d it's purely in the

717
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,100
prototype<font color="#CCCCCC"> stage at the moment and that</font>

718
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,679
is looking forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the moment when</font>

719
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,419
the developer tool the developing team

720
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,430
has all gone on to better things and

721
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,500
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> left with non-experts looking at</font>

722
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system now the guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up who</font>

723
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,880
will be doing this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future they've</font>

724
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:00,670
all grown up with their iPods and their

725
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,340
3d games and they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font>

726
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:06,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">down in front of a menu-driven menu</font>

727
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,870
drop-down system that requires them to

728
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,020
be expert in everything if it's not made

729
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:12,310
simple and easy and intuitive they're

730
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,200
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch it and they won't be</font>

731
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,590
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is looking</font>

732
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward rather preparing for that day</font>

733
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,949
yeah I agree you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to train for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

734
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,620
18 year olds the problem is is that

735
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,970
after you've shown them is visualization

736
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,040
you have to teach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do next</font>

737
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,420
and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that I run into all</font>

738
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,220
the time as I often look at the same

739
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,470
graphs and said yep that's still read it

740
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,210
was read yesterday we need to add more

741
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,830
fiber and it'll be read for a long time

742
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,870
from now but very cool system thank you

743
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:43,199
thank you we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one more</font>

744
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:47,050
question hi babak<font color="#E5E5E5"> past are about blue I</font>

745
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:51,070
broke the mic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I wanted to</font>

746
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:54,490
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you went about setting up</font>

747
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:58,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">baselines for all the metrics that</font>

748
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:03,370
you're monitoring application tied to

749
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:05,140
network usage tied to cpu you know all

750
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,899
of those types of things how did you go

751
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,910
about getting all the different

752
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:13,360
resources within the organizations that

753
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:15,580
are using those applications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font>

754
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,429
to give you the kind of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

755
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,399
identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bass lines ah because it's</font>

756
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,410
all in one experimental team all of the

757
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,660
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the monitoring</font>

758
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:28,330
data is is all goes to one control room

759
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:31,340
and nobody's hiding it from anybody else

760
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,780
the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue is digging</font>

761
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,179
through it fast enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

762
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,190
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> or is not going correctly so we</font>

763
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,680
don't have any there's no firewalls

764
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,950
between the datas each of these each of

765
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,950
these tools goes to the only the expert

766
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">group in of question so the</font>

767
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,790
environmental guys they use their p vs s

768
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,760
and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own look and feel</font>

769
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interface to it we just plug into</font>

770
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,720
their database and bring it into our

771
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,189
visualization system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can correlate</font>

772
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,740
with all of the other data that's

773
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,300
flowing at the same time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this makes</font>

774
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,910
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good selling point because of the</font>

775
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-stop shopping if you like so we</font>

776
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a problem there's no</font>

777
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">boundaries between the data is as far as</font>

778
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,649
the the rest of the suppliers are

779
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:19,989
concerned which is not the case for you

780
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:19,990
guys clearly thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryan</font>
