00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
good morning my name is Jeff Houston I'm

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,629
with a penny this was a lightning talk

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,740
but we've got some time so I can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:15,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit slower if you want um you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Kelvin anyone know that um the reason</font>

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,810
why it runs a two point three degrees

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,689
Kelvin<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that's the echo of the Big</font>

10
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,740
if you sort of stick your hand out there

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,050
in real space you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these little</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bubbles of microwave energy just going</font>

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,610

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,120
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the only thing that just sort</font>

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">of radiates in the dark v4 radiates in</font>

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,739
the dark if you stick your router in an

18
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,420
unadvertised part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address space</font>

19
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:57,750
and just listen you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on</font>

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:03,480
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> one packet every two seconds</font>

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:06,090
being being that packets toxic in fact

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite like that if you're lucky</font>

23
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,320
enough to have an IP address in the

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,199
bottom half of a /a<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know anyone from</font>

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,939
a dot one to a dot 128 anyone got one of

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:25,320
those come on hands up loser because

27
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">conficker hits the low half of every /a</font>

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,729
at about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rate of the high</font>

29
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,258
half so if you're in the low half you

30
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,939
get about one packet ever so five

31
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,869
packets every second Bing Bing Bing Bing

32
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,689
Bing Bing Bing all port 445 right so

33
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,720
most of this background radiation in v4

34
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,639
is incredibly toxic it just basically

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,920
aims at all those windows losers out

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,079
there and it runs it about if you total

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,170
it all up at<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 5.5 gigabits per</font>

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,639
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the entire v4 space and</font>

39
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,969
there are some 24s that are just

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:03,060
incredibly toxic who owns<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 10 / 24 I</font>

41
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:04,439
do that's real that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100</font>

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,840
megabits per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just complete</font>

43
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,030
crap oddly enough that's not all

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,190
configure that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> set but you</font>

45
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,850
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you own v4 it radiates in the</font>

46
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,720
dark now the real question

47
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:19,090
well that's before what about v6 because

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,310
if we're so good and we're bloody expert

49
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,250
have been actually generating toxic crap

50
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,590
in v4 how well are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we doing in v6 and</font>

51
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll v6 really be considered a mature</font>

52
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,630
technology until<font color="#E5E5E5"> it radiates as well so</font>

53
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,940
I thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font>

54
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,970
out exactly what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in v6 and</font>

55
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,090
has it reached maturity yet now

56
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,210
fascinatingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have this huge play pen</font>

57
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:46,680
inside v6 because some time ago back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

58
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:49,510
2006 all the rirs got given / twelves

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,570
you know in v4 / 12 is kind of ho-hum

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,149
bit boring but in v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> its enormous isn't</font>

61
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:57,280
it huge amount of space<font color="#E5E5E5"> and oddly enough</font>

62
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working hard in</font>

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,810
allocating v6 addresses over the last

64
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:06,010
four years so hard that out of that / 12

65
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:09,490
have allocated a phenomenal 1.59 percent

66
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:12,310
of it so in other words 98.4 1% of that

67
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,440
block is entirely vacant so I thought

68
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,440
I'd advertise it did anyone notice

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,239
congratulations the only one in the room

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that actually noticed you're right</font>

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,050
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody noticed someone actually</font>

72
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,550
advertised the / 3 in v6 over the over

73
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> winter last year did anyone notice</font>

74
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:36,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that well done only two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you was that</font>

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,270
one of you too by the way someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

76
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,549
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was wondering who the hell it was</font>

77
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:46,240
interestingly also not everyone who gets

78
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,790
v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> stress space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertisers v6 address</font>

79
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,840
space so that when actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

80
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,150
difference we did 709 allocations<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.5</font>

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">nine percent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us / 12 but there are</font>

only 323 advertisements in<font color="#CCCCCC"> other words</font>

83
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,330
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> two thirds of the space is actually</font>

84
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:08,079
advertised the rest is not this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

85
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,000
fascinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anyway um Martin saw it</font>

86
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,780
no one else did I did advertise this in

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,910
June it was advertised by a 75 75 it was

88
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,970
purely passive it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really hard</font>

89
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do spoofed source addresses in v6</font>

90
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,710
unfortunately i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know why to make</font>

91
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:25,390
it a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun so anyway here's what</font>

92
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,630
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually a graph of the</font>

93
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk</font>

94
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:32,170
the traffic the scale is linear and what

95
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,450
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows is around 500 kilobits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> per</font>

96
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,590

98
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,619
ICMP it's not UDP and it's not TCP that

99
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,510
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different when you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that v4</font>

100
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,140
you'll find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the configure part</font>

101
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,090
of the world it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp sins and in</font>

102
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,610
the other half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your / aid in the high</font>

103
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,770
half it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually all UDP just fishing</font>

104
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,190
around but there's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little icmp</font>

105
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,349
whereas in v6 this is almost all ICMP so

106
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,240
half a megabit per second in a / 12 and

107
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,890
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> was trying really hard full</font>

108
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,890
points for effort they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed</font>

109
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,250
a peak of 3.5 megabits per second and

110
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:16,150
sustained it for a whole second well

111
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,280
done guys you're doing really well talk

112
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:22,120
about the blind leading the misguided

113
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:26,650
too stupid places that's what v6 is all

114
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,440
about how the hell can I get in an

115
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,190
unadvertised address space a destination

116
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,960
unreachable now think about that

117
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,910
someone's obviously sent a packet to

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,430
some crap place that doesn't exist and

119
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,560
the router in the middle says ooh I

120
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know about that I'm going to send</font>

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you back an ICMP destination unreachable</font>

122
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,020
but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it I do think about</font>

123
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again it really is a double</font>

124
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,590
msconfig they don't know where it's

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,100
going and no one knows where the packet

126
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,950
came from and guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what three-quarters</font>

127
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,720
of the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this so three</font>

128
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,400
quarters of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark traffic is just the</font>

129
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,590
blind leading the blind to all the wrong

130
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">places and the rest is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a mere</font>

131
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,719
smattering of UDP and TCP so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

132
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,580
start to split this up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one actually</font>

133
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,060
fine when I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analyze this on the</font>

134
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,950
/<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20s is that there really is only one /</font>

135
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,500
20<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's causing all of this dark</font>

136
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,909
traffic so that big red peak in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

137
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,040
middle and this is logarithmic so it

138
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:28,120
stands out like a sore thumb is where

139
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:32,380
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this traffic is going to hmm this is</font>

140
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:35,560
NTT East most of the dark traffic i see

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,110
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to an unadvertised block that</font>

142
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,800
was already allocated

143
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:46,440
and two NT<font color="#E5E5E5"> T now what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntt do with</font>

144
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,750
this block it uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for IPTV and do</font>

145
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,350
they charge for traffic in this address

146
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,760
block because it's used for TV who could

147
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,430
possibly think that people would

148
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,370
reprogram their boxes to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

149
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,110
inside basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sideband not me</font>

150
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,030
and not all the rest of those other

151
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,680
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who then take their configured</font>

152
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,140
laptop into a public space and leak

153
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,880
traffic like crazy so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

154
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,800
this traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually leakage coming</font>

155
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,810
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> NT T and if I look at all the</font>

156
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,460
rest of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the rest of this</font>

157
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,280
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually leakage from</font>

158
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,710
allocated space it's just folk who don't

159
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,130
quite figure out that routing doesn't

160
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,289
work properly in v6 there is no such

161
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a private network I might just</font>

162
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,710
get over it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even if you don't</font>

163
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,690
advertise your address space you're

164
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,299
still going to leak like crazy there is

165
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,680
no RFC 1918 space in v6 so what we

166
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,130
actually see when we set up dark stuff

167
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,500
is a huge amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic leakage so</font>

168
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:47,880
let's try and split the two this is

169
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:53,700
trying to oh come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what I was trying</font>

170
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:59,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">to show was there's this red line I give</font>

171
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:01,440
up I get down to one packet every 38

172
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,840
seconds in v6 of dark traffic and

173
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,810
basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find is is almost</font>

174
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,960
nothing coming through in v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dark</font>

175
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:12,120
traffic in v6 that's truly dark going to

176
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,669
addresses that don't exist is actually

177
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,280
nothing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually fine when I listen</font>

178
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,740
in a / 12 is one packet every 30 6.8

179
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,750
seconds and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that packet count is</font>

180
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,580
actually still ICMP in remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

181
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,580
blind leading the blind know where that

182
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,719
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> all I really saw now I started to</font>

183
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,099
look at this a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more because there's</font>

184
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,170
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few packets you can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

185
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,550
at every last one now this is

186
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:37,380
fascinating 1126<font color="#CCCCCC"> syn packets hello are</font>

187
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,120
you there I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you are</font>

188
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,590
you're probably stuffed up the dns i'm

189
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to send a packet into the dark</font>

190
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:50,160
land cool a cynic now hang on I'm dark

191
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,760
this is not real someone is sending me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

192
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,540
sinner

193
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:58,080
where did they get the sin from who the

194
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,110
hell can't configure v6 hands up

195
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,730
everyone every last one of you you just

196
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,650
can't quite get these numbers right

197
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,860
because there are far more cynics and

198
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:11,069
sins this should not happen and best of

199
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,500
all and I love it there are 148 data

200
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,390
packets somehow those two machines

201
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">managed to exchange a cynic and then</font>

202
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,810
forget they ever existed to each other

203
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,410
and I'm seeing the data packet as a

204
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:25,109
result whoever's doing that well done

205
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,719
Wow um is anyone here from University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

206
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:31,020
Pennsylvania you've got to explain this

207
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,930
packet to me it's a ripper this is a dns

208
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,930
tcp data response without a handshake

209
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,729
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the result someone's</font>

210
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:44,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">just decided to launch into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ether</font>

212
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,930
then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp probing same source</font>

213
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,540
address no<font color="#E5E5E5"> proceeding cynic just probe</font>

214
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,520
packets coming from the harbin school of

215
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,439
engineering in china i believe and

216
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,470
they're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fine old time there and</font>

217
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,930
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing too here's to raid 0 going</font>

218
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,760
completely bizarre same source addresses

219
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,040
just probing through destination

220
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,040
addresses having a final time most of it

221
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,990
length 0 and this one I like this one I

222
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,199
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is this whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dual</font>

223
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:18,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">stack problem how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people run dual</font>

224
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:22,130
stack how do you know you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got your v6</font>

225
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,330
correctly configured how do you know

226
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy obviously didn't</font>

227
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,380
because what's going on is that he's

228
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,470
stuffed up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address of the mail</font>

229
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,180
server in v6 and every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> he tries to</font>

230
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,010
send mail he tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send it to</font>

231
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hurricane electrics mail server well</font>

232
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,910
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all well good and fine except</font>

233
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,200
he's got the address wrong so I get the

234
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:46,199
syn packets so he decided to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh 780</font>

235
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,450
emails and he tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

236
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,240
seven hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty times but</font>

237
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:55,410
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack he never noticed</font>

238
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,360
you know it tried TCP syn syn syn<font color="#CCCCCC"> and v6</font>

239
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,230
0 obviously be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is out for lunch i'm</font>

240
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,950
going to use v4 how many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

241
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,800
your v6 is working in

242
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,810
snack because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can bet you most of it</font>

243
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,329
doesn't because what's going on is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

244
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:13,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">we see this huge amount of v4 catching</font>

245
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:16,120
over the errors in v6 that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> typical</font>

246
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,300
example there someone's got the DNS

247
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,610
completely stuffed to 2892 queries into

248
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,979
dark space and again i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> answering</font>

249
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,990
these things but because they're dual

250
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,420
stacked whoever sending the packets of

251
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,580
never notices because the fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

252
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,469
v6 patches up all of these kinds of

253
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,490
errors and the other thing of course

254
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:39,250
dark ICMP this is his echo request 7800

255
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,440
pings pings into absolutely nowhere and

256
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,800
93 other just completely

257
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,240
packets so what do you see inside v6 to

258
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:53,380
actually look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it v6 isn't toxic you</font>

259
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,880
can't address scan let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through some</font>

260
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these numbers because I kind of like</font>

261
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,100
it remember the age of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the universe 13.7</font>

262
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,630
billion years so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do a little</font>

263
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought experiment you know I have this</font>

264
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:08,350
address scanner and it can scan ports at

265
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:10,600
a rate of 0 1 million a second how long

266
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:16,780
would it take to scan all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the v6</font>

267
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:19,150
addresses in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> / 48 any guesses 55</font>

268
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,500
billion years in other words a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

269
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,709
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> over six times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the life of the</font>

270
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,560
universe you cannot address scan<font color="#CCCCCC"> and v6</font>

271
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we see no address scanning there at</font>

272
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,640
this particular point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> other words</font>

273
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:34,270
what we actually see is that routing

274
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,830
does not create security and that most

275
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,060
of the work with most<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic we</font>

276
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,730
actually see is actually leakage from

277
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,459
private use contexts private networks

278
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,350
aren't private and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other thing is no</font>

279
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,180
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> can type in a v6 address and get it</font>

280
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,920
right as far as I can see they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

281
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,140
don't actually understand to get those

282
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,670
hex digits right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and most of those</font>

283
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,160
errors because of dual stack go

284
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,750
completely unnoticed it just looks like

285
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">your machines a bit slow but because</font>

286
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,740
most machines are virus ridden with

287
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,959
configure anyway no one notices in the

288
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">first place that it goes a bit slower so</font>

289
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,190
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as I can see the v6 traffic</font>

290
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,350
actually really isn't all that bad but

291
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,990
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens in v4 in terms of toxic</font>

292
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,520
traffic doesn't translate<font color="#E5E5E5"> into v6 we're</font>

293
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,390
not seeing virus scanners because

294
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,460
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work the same way</font>

295
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,840
address scanning actually doesn't work

296
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:23,510
so v6 isn't secure but we are going to

297
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">find is that as b6 matures the way in</font>

298
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,189
which toxic traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to appear</font>

299
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,410
in v6 is that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use crawling</font>

300
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,240
through DNS in order to do the

301
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,610
rendezvous because blind address

302
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,910
scanning isn't actually going to happen

303
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you very much</font>
