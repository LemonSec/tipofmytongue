1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,900
so good afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone my name is</font>

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,850
joy muscles and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for verisign and</font>

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,359
i'm here to present on half of the

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,330
verisign root root zone team going to

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,349
tell you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about Vera signs</font>

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,488
role in management of DNS SEC for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,350
root zone and going to make you sit

8
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,180
through a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinda like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a vacation</font>

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,270
slides show show you some pictures that

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,660
were taken at verisign earlier this year

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,120
when when we convert it over to the

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:51,169
validator bull zone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have one a</font>

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,930
book<font color="#CCCCCC"> ettore graph just share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you so</font>

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,989
briefly verisign is responsible for the

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,180
zone signing keys in the root zone

16
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,459
typically a sign zone would have zone

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,799
signing keys and key signing keys the

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,290
the KSK responsibility falls so I can

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,330
and right after my talk we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">from Mehmet from I can and he'll tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,970
a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about about what they</font>

22
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:19,320
do the CSK is a 1024 bit key with

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:22,770
sha-256 this key gets rolled over every

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,658
three months and Vera signs

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,390
cryptographic business operations unit

26
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,220
is responsible for generating and<font color="#E5E5E5"> main</font>

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,220
maintaining all of the the key material

28
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:40,740
so every three months there is a GSK

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,829
ceremony with in verisign there are

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,530
approximately six employees who are

31
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,110
designated as trusted persons they are

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:54,720
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ceremony the ceremony</font>

33
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:57,509
takes from 20 to 25 minutes previously

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,280
these ceremonies were held in Vera

35

<font color="#CCCCCC">output of a of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GSK ceremony is</font>

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,780
something that we call a key signing

43
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:29,019
request and this is the bit that gets

44

sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can so my initial feedback from</font>

46
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,700
talk was a little bit light so I thought

47
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,230
I'd thrown this nice chunk of XML to to

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,780
beef it up a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit this is a</font>

49
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:41,049
snippet of what the key signing request

50
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,820
actually looks like as you can see a lot

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,570
of lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML markup and send then</font>

52
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:50,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's some time periods and some date</font>

53
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,340
time stamps and<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS and so on it's</font>

54
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,989
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a bit longer than this</font>

55
00:02:51,340 --> 00:03:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just a bit that would fit on the</font>

56
00:02:52,990 --> 00:03:04,270
screen so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can holds the the key set</font>

57
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:08,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASX ceremony of which there have</font>

58
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:12,730
been two already and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main output of</font>

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:16,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to sign the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zs case and the</font>

60
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,560
KS case also since since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zs k is</font>

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,060
rolled over three months these

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,269
ceremonies are obviously held every

63
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,000
three months the output<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their</font>

64
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,850
ceremony is something called a signed

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,430
key response which is confusingly has

66
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:33,910
the same letters as the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> KSR just in</font>

67
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,850
a different order so the signs key

68
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,850
response contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> our our cigs and those</font>

69
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:45,760
are then added into the to the root zone

70
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:48,670
data so in terms of generating the the

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,220
root zone twice<font color="#CCCCCC"> twice a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day at verisign</font>

72
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,780
a new root zone is generated and this is

73
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,040
not new with DNS SEC it's always been

74
00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:00,130
this way there are numerous checks on

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,160
the contents of the zone most of them

76
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,940
are automated but a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are</font>

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,000
manual one of them it's done man

78
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,770
newly is that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the changes all the</font>

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,410
non DNS exchanges between the the

80
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:18,260
current zone and a candidate zone must

81
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,260
be correlated to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authorized change</font>

82
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,240
zone signing occurs within a secure

83
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,450
facility there's a number of signing

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,280
servers that pull in the zone data to be

85
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,700
signed it gets signed then it gets

86
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,900
pushed back out so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is due</font>

87
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> security policy that you're not</font>

88
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,609

89
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,640
anything into the signing system it has

90
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,200
to it has to poll for it every time the

91
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,729
zone assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all the signatures</font>

92
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,520
are generated freshly and after after

93
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the zone has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signed they get they</font>

94
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,090
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed back there are a number of</font>

95
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,150
validation tools that are run on the

96
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,609
sign data one of them is written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

97
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,460
one of them is written in by<font color="#CCCCCC"> meat by me</font>

98
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:09,600
in in Perl and I'll have a talk about

99
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in a second the output</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,980
tools are sent to folks in the in their

101
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,190
res ops team the resolutions operations

102
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,890
team who inspect that and then manually

103
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,169
approve the zone to be published at that

104
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:31,409
point it gets pushed out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the DNS</font>

105
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:33,599
stealth masters and the ftp site so the

106
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,240
tool that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote to do the validation</font>

107
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,730
of the root zone is is available it's

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,800
open source and available in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> URL</font>

109
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,950
there this is a it's a pretty good tool

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,280
for small zones like the root zone you

111
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,479
may not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run it on zones with you</font>

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,659
know millions or maybe hundreds of

113
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of entries but it does</font>

114
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,380
basically two things first it does a

115
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,450
crypto validation of the candidate zone

116
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,020
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that the signatures</font>

117
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:03,000
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid and the does a summary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

118
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,150
comparison<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the candidates own</font>

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,069
and the the current zone telling you how

120
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:18,500
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys are added or removed</font>

121
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:19,910
signatures changed and so on so next I

122
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,220
just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share with you some some</font>

123
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,319
photos that that were taken on July

124
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,690
fifteenth which is the day that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

125
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,190
zone was converted from unvalidated will

126
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,169
to validate able this is you know kind

127
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,310
of a big deal as you might expect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

128
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:33,289
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit to some of the</font>

129
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,830
people at verisign who worked really

130
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:38,060
hard on this this is Pete barber who

131
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,979
some of you may know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think he's been</font>

132
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,610
to an an auger<font color="#E5E5E5"> too he works in the</font>

133
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,750
naming resolutions operations team and

134
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,220
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did for this</font>

135
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,289
project was to develop these very long

136
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,389
and detailed checklists but all the

137
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:54,199
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that need to happen in transition</font>

138
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:56,330
from a non DNS SEC zone to a to the ders

139
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:01,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then from the doors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the valid a</font>

140
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:03,948

Ramesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a very long name sorry</font>

142
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:10,069
Ramesh Brian was sort of the lead

143
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,380
engineer for the resolutions operations

144
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,840
team and Ramesh actually wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,169
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think his rationale here is that</font>

165
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,940
in case something went horribly wrong he

166
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,349
didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any fingerprints</font>

Matt who many of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you can</font>

171
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,979
see he's holding a printout<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the root</font>

172
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,350
zone and I think he's gone through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

173
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,779
manually verified every signature with

his trusty HP calculator and given his

175
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:53,760
thumbs up that that it's good and ready

176
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:58,000
to go and here's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

hanging around<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas's cube as he's</font>

their phones with their brokers deciding

whether or not to to sell their company

183
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:16,770
see how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all going to play out here</font>

184
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:16,770
in a few minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably would be</font>

so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give a talk</font>

186
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,829
without throwing in a graph here's

187
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:28,689
here's some data from July fifteenth

188
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,920
actually a 48-hour period we're right

189
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,570
around the the maintenance window which

190
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,719
you can see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> red line</font>

191
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:38,380

192
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,839

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,900

196
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,209
it signed yet is it signed yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

197

198
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:55,420
readies it ready and I think the

199
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,640
official sort of time is about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2050</font>

200
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:03,699
UTC was when the validator bo-zone was

201
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:06,939
actually published so<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally just a nod</font>

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,979
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really great idea it did a good</font>

job of allowing us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,490
you know watch things very carefully as

210
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,860
as it was deployed and of course we

211
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,810
didn't during this transition we didn't

212
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,080
discover any and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he brokenness or any</font>

went back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normal levels we would</font>

227
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,450
expect this to go up more slowly over

228
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:29,589
time as more what people can figure

pretty much based on various aspects

257
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,730
first of all transparency is very

258
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,819
important because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a key that</font>

259
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,830
everybody will be trusting and for that

260
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,490
we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to be as transparent as</font>

261
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:39,900
open as it's possible so there's no

262
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:42,900
question on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is working on</font>

286
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,550
secure sites but the secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites as</font>

287
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,400
well build within the specifications of

288
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,130
skiff facilities which if you have ever

289
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,010
worked with the US government<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects</font>

290
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,000
it would be familiar with we have some

291
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,830
tier mentality and tears are basically

292
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,710
just separating the duties and the

293
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:18,770
people that can enter inside and perform

294
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:21,470
some work these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some pictures</font>

295
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,000
that you can find regarding skips and

296
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,120
internet and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually our</font>

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,910
facility the wall basically has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mesh</font>

298
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,590
inside so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not well another</font>

299
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,800
drywall that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

300
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:37,850
as well you're in some areas we are also

301
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:41,240
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> concrete walls and some high-level</font>

302
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:45,190
security iris scanners we also use in

303
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,800
the systems and we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> highest grade</font>

304
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,810
the safes that are available in the

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,990
role but I was the ceremony

318
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,670

exceptions depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the situation</font>

326
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:48,360
like power goes on what we do sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

obviously internal witness is our second

<font color="#CCCCCC">I can staff role which is a person that</font>

takes notes of every act everything

331
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,860
that's happening and basically that

332
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:06,850
wedding that goes into our audit logs

333
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:09,490
and system administrator is a separated

334
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:11,679
separate duty basically he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

335
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,589
responsible of all the audit cameras all

336
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,250
the streaming cameras we as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

337
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,839
stream our ceremonies so and then we

338
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,849
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the safe security controllers those</font>

339
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,909
are the people that has no facility

340
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,770
access but they have access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> safes</font>

341
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,390
that are in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will quickly</font>

342
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,720
mention about this so this is like a

343
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:35,380
diagram that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was generously Peru created</font>

344
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:39,700
by one of our essays so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see in</font>

345
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:44,350
this room I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> SCA and I as I with an</font>

346
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:47,440
eye w have enough power to enter the

347
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:50,050
tier 5 where you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the saves however I</font>

348
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,180
cannot open the safe I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SSC a</font>

349
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,730
security safe security controller to be

350
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,160
with me as well as there is a cabinet

351
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,470
that's actually a full<font color="#CCCCCC"> 42u cabinet that</font>

352
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,630
you see

353
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,880
in left hand side I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no access to</font>

354
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,789
that so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can disable the alarm it has</font>

355
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,409
to be sa who can control that but I say

356
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:08,299
cannot enter by themselves there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

357
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:10,789
cannot also enter to that level by

358
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:15,139
ourselves so we separated the duties

359
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:18,140
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that multiple</font>

360
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:22,460
duties multiple personnel needs to be

361
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:26,150
present in order to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything and</font>

362
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,820
basically out bro there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS egg</font>

363
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:34,909
practice statement that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find in</font>

366
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,408
of got excited now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forget the</font>

367
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,210
address which I shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be but</font>

368
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:45,799
auditing and transparency as I said we

369
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,070
will be audited everything has been

370
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:51,879
transparent but we are doing has you

371
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:55,220
know we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have any secrets</font>

372
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,250
trusted community representatives you

373
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,669
all know you can see some of them in if

374
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,890
you have any questions to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

375
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:06,830
some names here that if you want to ask

376
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,570
them how what they think about this and

377
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,750
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go around the</font>

378
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,780
different meetings and made some public

379
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:19,580
announcements regarding their look and

380
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:23,480
feel for the ceremonies those roles are

381
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:26,120
I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically explained you probably</font>

382
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard the news in the ABC at CNN and</font>

383
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,239
some other TV channels that there is no

384
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,000
way to restart<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet you all know</font>

385
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than I do there are no no</font>

386
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,380
ink guardians of internet there's no

387
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,659
such thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought I would mention</font>

388
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,090
say that but there are some creepy

389
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:47,780
officers but crypto officers is that we

390
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:52,480
gave this duty to operate the h SMS

391
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:57,110
which is where the KSK is being stored

392
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:01,970
to be basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> our whole giving the</font>

393
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:03,770
rights of operating this<font color="#CCCCCC"> HSM into some</font>

394
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,169
cards into some smart cards and those

395
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:09,210
smart cards are located<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the facility</font>

396
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:11,039
in some safe deposit box

397
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,260
the boxes that are in those safes

398
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,020
however only the people who has access

399
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that is the crypto officers so we</font>

400
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">have crypt officers for locations seven</font>

401
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:25,289
for each<font color="#E5E5E5"> location and we need minimum of</font>

402
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:28,678
three in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to operate and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font>

403
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:30,360
recovery key shareholders and we need

404
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,960
five of seven in case of a catastrophic

405
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,918
issue let's say h SMS all went bad

406
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,049
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some kind of problem that all</font>

407
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,000
that they are all having and if you need

408
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:44,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">to recreate the key we would need the</font>

409
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,700
recovery key shareholders<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

410
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:50,850
could probably mention the fact that in

411
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,029
case of losing both facilities we could

412
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:59,090
also use them but it's very unlikely to

413
00:20:54,029 --> 00:21:02,970
lose LA and Virginia at the same time so

414
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:06,480
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some technical be skipping</font>

415
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:10,890
some of my slides be real fast and all

416
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,070
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so about the the ceremonies</font>

417
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:18,299
we will have for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ceremonies today we are</font>

418
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:20,820
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be having one ceremony in East</font>

419
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Coast and then one ceremony on east west</font>

420
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:27,720
coast and then we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to continue</font>

421
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:31,668
repeating that some milestones since

422
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,020
last year last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> July August the</font>

423
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:35,580
project was finally announced and this

424
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,658
is the website that i forgot few minutes

425
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,760
ago its<font color="#E5E5E5"> route dash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns at the org and</font>

426
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:44,789
january through may we work with those

427
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,559
as Dwayne have explained first ceremony

428
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:51,390
has happened in Culpeper Virginia and

429
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,580
basically this is a picture that we took

430
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,490

whether we were we will be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

sign in route and this is the second

444
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:36,989
ceremony with similar faces that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

445
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:40,289
see in this meeting as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well again they</font>

446
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,179
made me very eyes to it and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

447
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:48,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route DNS SEC team just includes a</font>

448
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:50,460
very sign and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees and they</font>

449
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:54,918
have put so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much effort in this so it's</font>

450
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:58,200
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it to recognize them and ARPA is</font>

451
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:01,500
sign since<font color="#E5E5E5"> March and right now the keys</font>

452
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,710
are being managed by verisign and right

453
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,970
now we're working on a model just

454
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:14,789
similar like<font color="#CCCCCC"> route and that's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up soon and e.164 the darpa sign by</font>

456
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:22,429
ripe as you know and other our children

457
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:25,500
are signed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN since april as well</font>

458
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:28,470
da stop mission you can go to this

459
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,380
website to<font color="#CCCCCC"> submit and learn more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

460
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,950
the routine sx submissions and there are

461
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,840
this is this changes like every hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

462
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,630
something because a lot of interest

463
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,939
happening in the nsx so i think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

464
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:46,200
not the latest but this is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

465
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:49,110
as close as to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest status right</font>

466
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,159
now about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the which the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> t all these have</font>

467
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:56,178
the CTR DNS SEC implemented and you can

00:23:53,159 --> 00:24:02,639
start your validators visit our website

ceremony will happen in Culpeper

471
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:14,100
Virginia November one we will start at

472
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:16,470
one p.m. eastern time if anything

473
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens that day some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people cannot make</font>

474
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:22,940
it etc we will use the

475
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:29,080
update of second and it will be live web

476
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:29,080
cast as well string so any questions

477
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:44,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right you remembered your what</font>

478
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:48,769
that was good and next sun state is this

479
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:57,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">heartache</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good</font>

480
00:24:48,769 --> 00:25:01,809
ah you bring young pc oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font>

481
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,809
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary but we'll figure it out</font>

482
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:13,070
okay whatever test

483
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:20,029
I chest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can cigarette listen yeah</font>

484
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:20,029
the slides yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

485
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,980
to have the slides I'll see if not I

486
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,980
have to

487
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,340
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tested early</font>

488
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,660
ok how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a good fiscal</font>

489
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,450
there is

490
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright hi my name is where our decree I</font>

491
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,680
work for sparta which got<font color="#CCCCCC"> bought out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

492
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,380
too long ago by a company called<font color="#CCCCCC"> cobham</font>

493
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about what</font>

494
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,440
you just heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the route was signed</font>

495
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,690
you now know that everything's done very

496
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,100
securely in very big bolts and a lot of

497
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were checking it right when the</font>

498
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,770
route was signed and then they probably

499
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:24,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">went now what because what happens next</font>

500
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,860
how are we actually going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

501
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:29,220
wonderful spiffy<font color="#CCCCCC"> signed route now that</font>

502
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,750
we have it so for those of you who how

503
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:38,010
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people understand d in a sec really</font>

504
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:39,450
well here you got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few so here the</font>

505
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,950
prerequisite for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is you have</font>

506
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,380
to understand it at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

507
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,420
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your 30-second recap to get</font>

508
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,580
you through the prerequisite the route

509
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,080
publishes a couple of keys which<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

510
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,840
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about there's a key signing</font>

511
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,080
key and a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> z citing zone</font>

512
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,899
signing keys and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are used to</font>

513
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,520
generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> cryptographic signatures on all</font>

514
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,290
the other data so the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> signing key</font>

515
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,030
creates a cryptographic signature for

516
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,560
the route for those own signing key the

517
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:08,160
zone signing key creates cryptographic

518
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,290
signatures for everything else now when

519
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have children like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the route has a</font>

520
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,730
number of children they need to publish

521
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,080
NS records and glue records and things

522
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,720
like that that you probably are familiar

523
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,730
with in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that they are now</font>

524
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,250
publishing what's called a delegation

525
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,740
signer record or a d/s record so there

526
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a d/s record for example for org</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

527
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,350
that's a cryptographic hash of orgs key

528
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,909
so org has keys and calm will have keys

529
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,370
and net will have keys and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

530
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,860
that in a minute or it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much</font>

531
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,600
the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example they publish</font>

532
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,580
a key signing key for the org which

533
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,740
signs the zone signing key which signs

534
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,710
everything underneath it and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

535
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,670
publishes a d/s record for<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana gorg</font>

536
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:53,310
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not there at the moment</font>

537
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:55,710
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that in a minute too so i'm</font>

538
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:58,530
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to where the where we are</font>

539
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">today you know the root of signed the</font>

540
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,260
interesting thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

541
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,620
lot of politics surrounding the root

542
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,210
signature and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won't go into those but</font>

543
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,908
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually some people that said</font>

544
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

545
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:11,049
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never be deployed and because the</font>

546
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:12,580
route would never get signed well it has

547
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:16,840
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed so therefore there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

548
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,129
excuses left right the real benefit of

549
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,320
having assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> route is that it</font>

550
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:23,379
provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single trust anchor that</font>

551
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,539
everything else can link back up to so

552
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:27,699
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a number of tlds that have</font>

553
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">also been signed there's about 28 and</font>

554
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:33,129
that was in September some of which

555
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,559
aren't fully operational yet some big

556
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:39,158
ones have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been signed including org busy</font>

557
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:41,229
jus us and then there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font>

558
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:43,629
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have announced plans but</font>

559
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:46,029
haven't quite gotten to actually rolling

560
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:47,889
out yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> includes calm and net</font>

561
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:51,970
both have published dates where they

562
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:53,408
will they will spin up on September 7th

563
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,869
according to sex spider which is an

564
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:59,019
interesting website that tries to

565
00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:02,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">collect how many zones out there are are</font>

566
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:05,830
actually in production they currently

567
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:08,169
have 25,000 production signed sounds

568
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:13,228
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a decent number and</font>

569
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:16,330
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go up over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time now</font>

570
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:18,460
that's on the publication side who's

571
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,199
using it is the real question who's

572
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,479
actually consuming those signatures and

573
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,779
checking them there actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

576
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:32,109

580
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,869
statistic so what you do with statistics

581
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:42,969
when you forget them as you make them

582
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:45,249
even more fuzzy than they were before so

583
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:48,519
I know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 75% and my memory says</font>

584

us too to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it worked so that</font>

599
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:22,399
you guys could be next so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

show some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty pictures next and in</font>

601
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,770
these pretty pictures there's some

602
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,110
important things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know I took a web</font>

604
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,490
drew pretty pictures from the traffic

605
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:40,190
though each line that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see is</font>

606
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:42,350
one dns lookup<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it's the result</font>

607
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,690
of loading one web page in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page</font>

609
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,990
the lines are also color-coded so orange

610
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a query basically the client or the</font>

validating resolver requesting something

612
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,930
blue is an insecure response meaning it

613
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,700
there's no valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> dateable data to go</font>

615
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,660
incorrect it's just that there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

616
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,250
way to check it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> green was</font>

617
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,720
secured so obviously we're hoping for

618
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the world to eventually get to green</font>

619
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,530
there's also a few red lines which are

620
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,650
truncated meaning they had to switch to

621
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP which is common for querying keys so</font>

622
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:21,560
the first one is I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can all</font>

623
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:25,970
see this really clearly right that's our

624
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:30,350
website that's WWE NSA tools org that's

625
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:32,510
loading one<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't put a whole</font>

627
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:38,030
i will say that that was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new</font>

628
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,500
instantiation of bind starting up and it

629
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,940
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the priming so if we</font>

630
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,260
remove the priming queries it gets a

631
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,730
little bit simpler you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

632
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,250
almost all the responses are green and

633
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,740
in fact the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only blue ones there are</font>

634
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,480
actually back to the client because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

635
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,780
client wasn't checking DNS SEC the

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,010
validating resolver nearby was actually

637
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other interesting thing as long as</font>

638
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,120
I'm here the bubbles on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom that</font>

639
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,650
only have arrows going up that was in

640
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,959
the process of where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped TCP dump</font>

stopped my web browser restarted

642
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,430
everything I was still getting answers

643
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,500
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous slide and so you still</font>

644
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,640
get occasionally stuff coming back some

645
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,700
of which are green and some of which are

646
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,350
blue so that's a fairly simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page</font>

647
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,020
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are grouped the</font>

648
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,100
boxes are organizational zones that that

651
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:31,080
example here's a more interesting

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,159
website because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the small one we</font>

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:39,059
external images and things like that CNN

655
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:41,490
on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand is significantly more</font>

656
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,710

658
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:49,559
much you can go zoom in on that on your

that org is not publishing one so

687
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:54,480
there's a gap there in the communication

688
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,059
it's actually not possible to validate

on validation in your resolvers or

setting up a side by side validating

712
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:52,350
there's a link there that you can follow

722
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,850
to one of the ones that do and then

into your notebook if you want obviously

729

to fetch more keys fetch all the records

and be able to validate them and it

748
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,660
requires a UDP fragmentation or falling

operators what are the users going to

793
00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:00,258
see you know if you turn on validating

00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:02,670
resolvers what are they going to see

795
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:04,799
really they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see much in</font>

796
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,809
fact if you go do validation today

797
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:08,880
you'll you can type these in by hand to

798

and try them on your laptop right now in

803
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,089
because I messed up that signature

804
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,709
intentionally it's a test zone I went

805
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:27,599
and modified the signature if you're

rest of them they're only doing the one

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,350

855
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,380
really cool bootstrapping that we can do

856
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,540
and we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> away some of the really</font>

857
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,780
scary you know aspects of delivering

858
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:24,310
email and things like that secure

859
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,660
cryptographic lookups I think it's one

860
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the most powerful things that we have</font>

you to do that so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can trust the</font>

links there's people working on rather

870

than<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you type in HTTP your bank com</font>

871
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,020
you should be able to jump directly to

872

https without going

873
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,520
to the HTTP redirect that is so insecure

874

that everybody knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and the one</font>

875
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,350
that really scares<font color="#CCCCCC"> me now if you're like</font>

00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">me I get about 4,000 mail messages a day</font>

878
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:12,220
would you ever notice if somebody took

879
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:14,830
one of those MX records and kick spoofed

880

it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> snarfed all your mail and it went</font>

you ever notice it's probably happened I

884
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,600
bet nobody here you know would have any

886
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,220
the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'm most curious</font>

about getting DNS SEC deployed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> is MX</font>

fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well but you know the most</font>

895
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,930
important thing is start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a little</font>

896
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,580
bit of thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what types of</font>

897
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">things could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you stick in to DNS that</font>

898
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:55,299
might be useful in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> for though</font>

899
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,980
and then go find<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody that likes to</font>

900
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,450
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IETF n and we'll design</font>

901
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">something at a committee just for you</font>

902
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:03,910
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally here's the other</font>

903
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,250
interesting thing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people say</font>

904
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,440
well but all of my users they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

905
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,300
fine they're sitting behind you know all

906
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,630
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure in my enterprise and</font>

907
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,040
it's already secure we do you know

908
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,930
there's no way that they can be spoofed

909
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can put up a validating resolver that</font>

910
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,490
that will help you're right but do your

911
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,900
users ever stay at work unfortunately

912
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:26,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them there I know some of</font>

913
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,270
you probably tried they do go home they

914
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,160
do go to coffee shops they do go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

915
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:34,180
conventions like Nana which doesn't have

916
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,830
a validating resolver and they do check

917
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,580
email from their phone which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even</font>

918
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:41,770
a device you control so in the long run

919
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,810
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get security all the way to</font>

920
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,090
the client we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look into a</font>

921
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,220
longer term approach which would be to

922
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,850
validate directly in the end application

923
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:56,589
itself so here's a quick pro and con

924
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:59,049
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> of validating in a nearby resolver</font>

925
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:02,350
versus<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it an application in a</font>

926
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:04,290
nearby validating resolver you refuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

927
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,480
give them the answers

928
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,610
they can still be spoofed locally even

929
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,880
if even if Nana was validating resolver

930
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:13,260
all of you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> operating wirelessly well</font>

931
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,670
you're asking your questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> in securely</font>

932
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,320
so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get insecure answers</font>

933
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,450
if one person here is out there you know

934
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to redirect all your DNS lookups</font>

935
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:24,210
and the other hand if it you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

936
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,680
application then you get security all

937
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,670
the way there you can do the magical

938
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,890
things that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier</font>

939
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">like auto key acceptance and things like</font>

940
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:34,830
that it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> provides for much more</font>

941
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:36,150
useful error codes specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

942
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:39,210
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the person the domain</font>

943
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:42,750
doesn't exist so here's what I like to

944
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:45,030
refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the positive negative these</font>

945
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,440
are two screenshots from our Firefox

946
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,050
application before and after we

947
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,800
instrumented it with DNS SEC and i went

948
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a website that does not exist DNS SEC</font>

949
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,260
tools org you can't read that so here's

950
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:59,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the readable version now this is</font>

951
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,160
interesting if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go look at what</font>

952
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Firefox coders had to do when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there when</font>

953
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,819
you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you couldn't get a DNS lookup</font>

954
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:08,040
right the best you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is you couldn't</font>

955
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,390
get the DNS lookup you don't know why so

956
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,460
if you go look at the error messages

957
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,140
that you get you get all these fuzzy

958
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,480
things like hey did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a mistake</font>

959
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,730
while you were typing are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

960
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it exists as you know we can't say</font>

961
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:21,300
that it does or doesn't are you able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

962
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">browse other sites as your firewall</font>

963
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,220
being a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem you have no idea what</font>

964
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:30,420
the problem was on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand if you</font>

965
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:33,029
were not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a a record with DNS</font>

966
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,240
SEC we can tell you positively it does

967
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,800
not exist which means that that we were

968
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,109
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduce the error code list down</font>

969
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,580
to something very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple did you</font>

970
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,710
make a mistake typing that's always

971
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,890
still possible because the domain you

972
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:48,210
typed does not exist now that is much

973
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,100
more user-friendly and it's an

974
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,470
interesting side effect of doing Deanna

975
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:55,560
seconds we can get much better error

976
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:57,450
codes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally I have a whole</font>

977
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of applications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i can</font>

978
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">demonstrate for you i'll do those in a</font>

979
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,970
minute

980
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,960
I'm not going to do them right now

981
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:04,970
because I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how much</font>

982
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I have left here in a minute but we</font>

983
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">have seven minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have</font>

984
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,359
Firefox and openssh and mail apps w get

985
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and NC ftp some of these applications</font>

986
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,970
were actually submitting the patches

987
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:20,450
back to and they've already accepted it

988
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:21,799
like NC ft P&L ftp w get said that they

989
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,470
did but it's not currently in the

990
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,700
repository we're looking into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

991
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:28,129
have a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of zone maintenance</font>

00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,899
tools like zone signer and roller d and

00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,730
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that allow you to help</font>

00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain your zones and then we have a</font>

995
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,690
lot of debugging tools to that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

996
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:38,330
might look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into and our web page</font>

997
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,650
discusses all of them and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

998
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:43,190
we have a validating library for

instrumenting in applications here's an

00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,230
SEC is too big to fit all the way down

1002
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,030
in the end application well this is

1003
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:56,360
running on my phone this is a screenshot

1006
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,069
it's actually validated that our site is

install it for application application

1013

developers here's some resources from

1014
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,899
our library we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a library</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called lib</font>

1017
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,090
we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more complex one if you</font>

1018
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,240
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into nitty gritty</font>

1019
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,680
lookups and some things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

1020
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,810
the interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've noticed</font>

1021
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">after doing a fair amount of research is</font>

1022
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,620
a lot of applications are poorly written

1023
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,990
and figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> that DNS would never change</font>

1024
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:40,970
because they were written based on 80s

1025
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:43,490
code books and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

1026
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,509
weren't written on modern thought chains

1027
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,669
that said maybe you ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1028
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,130
default statement in a case statement to

1029
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,600
check unknown error conditions and that

1030
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:54,020
makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit tricky for for</font>

1031
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:57,620
some applications finally here are some

whether you're a zone producer and then

1046
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,529
iono has the website for where to get

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,379
time is right to sign your zones and to

1053

turn on validation to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your users</font>

and to makes use of secured concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fingerprint and you</font>

1060

either don't check it or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

that's what we're going to do now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:12,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route actually is signed so please</font>

1066
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:19,419
do turn it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and play with it because</font>

1086
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,830
we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually submit patches to them</font>

1087
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,870
at one point last I checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we're</font>

trying to decide what validating library

they they really thought was the best

1090
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,759
one to use there's actually more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

1091
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:31,390
one out there no I understand if you

submit anything to openssh<font color="#E5E5E5"> reza patch</font>

you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a long wait before it</font>

1094
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,340
actually goes in but if it's not

actually here right now he could

1110
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,820
probably comment on it but they did sign

1111
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,799
previous to org being signed and the

1112
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,600
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a big</font>

which ones don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll let you put them</font>

the good news is that's approve
