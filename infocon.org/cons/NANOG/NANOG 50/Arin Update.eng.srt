1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:09,959
ok good morning yes I was a whirly ball

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:22,740
irregular don't doubt about it let's see

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:35,190
if we can get this going okay that's

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:41,010
nice now which one's project<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

5
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:44,610
sorry yes no it's okay the version of

6
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,050
your bucket okay so the first thing

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,420
people ask me when I stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of a</font>

8
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,959
room like this is you have a sports<font color="#E5E5E5"> coat</font>

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,960
on drawn

10
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,810
you

11
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,430
it's a big part of our community so

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,649
let's go what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have intense been</font>

13
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,210
happening first a reminder 4-byte asn s

14
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,150
can I ask a question here because we've

15
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:57,030
been flogging this foolish for a while

16
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:59,700
who here doesn't have a 4-byte asn<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

17
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,649
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not problematic because you</font>

18
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,259
probably already had nasan let me ask a

19
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,280
more important<font color="#E5E5E5"> question who doesn't</font>

20
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:14,820
support peering with 4-byte asn bgp

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:16,950
speakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we at some</font>

22
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:22,530
point figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to fix that I guess</font>

23
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,149
I'd say fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt so so the reason I</font>

24
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,970
ask is the statement at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

25
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:31,050
this you know we've issued 69 4-byte asn

26
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,269
s 42 of them have<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back and all of</font>

27
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,900
them have said matt said his router

28
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:40,560
won't support 4-byte asn<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can't</font>

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,320
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any other conclusion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i</font>

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,209
presume everyone supports 4-byte asn s

31
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,579
if you do not support for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs it's</font>

32
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,470
very important we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have enough</font>

the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> done if we count enterprise okay</font>

36
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,579
a lot of organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that want to have</font>

quicker and we get mum queries a lot

for BOTS we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had any success for</font>

correlation with that some people

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,340
suggest it's a PC startup or Mac start

77
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,200
up someone's device driver or dll but in

there in everyone's end computer that

certainly wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intent of the</font>

operational who is database if you're

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,660
doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that you definitely</font>

89
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,240
we replaced who is with the restful

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,890
interface major an upgrade very

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,170
efficient more consistent with the

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing documentation no not the</font>

93
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,630
existing practice just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing</font>

94
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,370
documentation the pilot is available if

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we have</font>

96
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,280
documentation that describes the changes

97
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,550
we put a listener on port 43 for

98
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,309
existing queries and it passes things

99
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,980
through it uses restful technology we

100
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,170
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually turn on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write access via</font>

101
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,120
this so again if you're writing back end

102
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,370
systems or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> pam's or provisioning</font>

103
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,620
systems you should begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at this</font>

104
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,930
this is the interface we'd prefer you to

105
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,640
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> over Swit because we all know how</font>

106
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,140
reliable<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swift's are they work all the</font>

107
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,380
time except when they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

108
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,580
they work very quickly and very poorly

109
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,960
so we'd really like this you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

110
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more state information you are</font>

111
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,669
far more granular control if you have

112
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,760
feedback on this I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to make</font>

113
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,830
sure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> darren's engine</font>

114
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,080
department gets feedback on what you

115
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of the restful interface if you're</font>

116
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,830
not getting good responses then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,060
to know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because well</font>

118
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,190
obviously we're not serving the

119
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,830
community I think we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good job</font>

120
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,300
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the interface is useful we are</font>

121
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,560
working out quirks and the reason that

122
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,440
we haven't turned it on is we're

123
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,320
actively seeking feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole point I see Aaron coming up</font>

there's a listing service if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

you can list it in listing service

none realistically we've still got

addresses when they satisfy their need

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,830
day when too happy parties show up in

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,969
transfer their resources per the policy

<font color="#CCCCCC">nooope templates part of changing Aaron</font>

218
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,980
online required actually having a schema

for our database that actually reflects

223
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,000
didn't actually reflect reality and so

224
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,640
we had to tweak<font color="#CCCCCC"> the templates a little</font>

225
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,680
so the Twitter the swip templates that

226
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use actually get processed a little</font>

227
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,069
differently if you're submitting

228
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,260
templates all the time you might want to

229
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,870
go read about these because we did have

it's called to let your certificate

authority interface with ours so you can

have a hierarchy and you can run your

particularly important about people

serving a federal agency you might hear

300
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,760
them asking now about v6 because they're

301
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,100
interested if you're a vendor you

302
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably have federal customers asking</font>

implementation slides and experiences

334
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,210
policies so we've also been busy to

335
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,830
share of policies we have implemented

336
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,890
the following three policies in

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,350

342
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,110
requirement that's built in this is

343
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,480
something important folks for people

344
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,150
running filters these are changes to

345
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,580
minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allison allocation size and it</font>

346
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,650
changed the MMA transfer policy made

347
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,930
easier but it also has clauses

348
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:19,490
specifically thats a return your unused

349
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:22,130
resources adopted impending the waiting

350
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,800
list for unmet ipv4 requests there is a

351
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,990
theory that there could be people who

352
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,760
need addresses who don't think they were

353
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be able to get them on a market</font>

354
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are just going to wait maybe where</font>

355
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,260
professors will be returned and we

356
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,000
should have a waiting list this

357
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,280
implements the waiting list it's a

358
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,410
fairly complex policy it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

359
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,390
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun to implement because that</font>

360
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,430
will match up if you're on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting</font>

361
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,189
list for ipv4 addresses when we run out

362
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,930
and a block gets returned there's an

363
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,870
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> to determine who ends up</font>

364
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,010
getting that block or pieces of it it's

365
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a bit for the staff to</font>

366
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,819
digest that luckily<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still have</font>

367
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,900
addresses so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a need for waiting</font>

368
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,780
list right now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have it</font>

369
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,939
implemented timely early next year

370
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,620
current draft policies so I know a lot

by Aaron don't affect you obviously they

376
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,710
do as you can see by the prior slide let

377
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,750
me give you an idea of what's coming up

378
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,760
that you might want to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in if</font>

379
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,490
you can't stay remote participation is a

380
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,350
great option increasing the ipv4

381
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,710

right now staff has discretion of

393
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,120
whether we do a resource review in

394
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:05,720
certain circumstances this would make it

group helps coordinate global policy and

403
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:29,110
helps make sure that we when we bring a

416
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,950
of how we coordinate global policies I

417
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,039
ask everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay attention to this you</font>

444
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,039
probably should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be addressed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

the federal government<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh Kevin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

mini snet can't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot</font>

447
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:21,279
anyway just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting senile the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this the</font>

448
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,490
federal requirement for ipv6 which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

449
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,409
delighted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see to have you looked at</font>

450
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,360
it to see if they were careful enough to

451
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:31,000
avoid agencies weaseling their way

452
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,229
around it by doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricks like they did</font>

453
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,149
when they were required to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6</font>

454
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,429
connectivity to their backbones a couple

455
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:38,168
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago specifically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm worried they</font>

456
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:40,809
will bring up their public facing

457
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:44,049
services with slightly different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

458
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:45,039
only names so that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't</font>

459
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,299
have to have them working very well

460
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,980
because I figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody's going to</font>

461
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,210
really be touching them so they can sort

462
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,580
of hide them and forget about them and

463
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,500
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about ipv6 beyond</font>

464
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,299
getting it to swear somebody downloads a

465
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,330
web page once and they declare victory

466
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:59,590
right so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is as people might</font>

467
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,620
know if you were involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the federal</font>

468
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,330
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US government in 2005 at</font>

469
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:08,110
a memorandum that said you have to run

470
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,610
ipv6 in your backbone and 2008 all the

471
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,769
agencies had to prove that so they all

472
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,418
brought up their IP connectivity long

473
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:16,690
enough to do a ping print it out the

474
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:18,970
ping test and then shut down v6 to some

475
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:25,210
extent given the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of security</font>

476
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:28,029
equipment firewalls some routers CPU

477
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,730
code paths that actually was prudent in

478
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:33,370
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a</font>

statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> says on an ongoing basis</font>

480
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:39,039
they will have their services available

481
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:43,240
by ipv6 additionally there's a second

482
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:46,269
requirement which is by 2014 internal

483

services will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on ipv6 which I</font>

485
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:54,668
still defining those so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a go</font>

486
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:56,610
taste ipv6 and walk away this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

487
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,110
federal government said it's moving

everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay attention does</font>
