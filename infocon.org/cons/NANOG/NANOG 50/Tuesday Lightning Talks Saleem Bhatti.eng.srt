00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,800
at MIT and they looked at the

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,710
effectiveness of DNS caching at edge

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,809
sites and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did a trace driven</font>

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,819
was that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very noisy a lot of it was</font>

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,860
retransmissions or<font color="#CCCCCC"> errored packets but</font>

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,620
with the trace driven emulation they saw

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to have a</font>

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,490
because that same paper found that

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,090
examining the DNS traces there was

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,360
little spatial or temporal locality in

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:23,369
the dns lookups that they found in those

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,770
traces those who were that was a trace

26
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,409
driven emulation so we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,759
actually do the experiment at San Andrew

28
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:36,630
so we took our entire school network all

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,350
the clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> and servers and shoved their</font>

30
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,289
a records and various other records down

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,770
through various TTL values across four

32
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,110
successive weeks so we started at 1800

33
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,079
seconds then we moved to 30 seconds 15

34
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,380
seconds and then down 20 seconds we also

35
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,789
configured or all the client systems not

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,070
to have any caching on the on the host

37
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,960
host themselves and we also configure

38
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,119
things like Firefox and ie not to cash

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,068
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would get a full</font>

40
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,068
picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of load that you</font>

41
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,230
might get if you had

42
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,999
TTL for an entire site of course you

43
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,340
wouldn't really do this are my

44
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:17,138
motivation for this was this work I'm

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,819
doing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Island p and supporting</font>

46
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:21,879
mobile hosts which would perhaps be a

47
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,560
handful of hosts or certainly not the

48
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,590
whole site<font color="#CCCCCC"> but anyway doing the whole</font>

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,870
site was a nice way to get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

50
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,159
just of information on how we got the

51
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,840
data and process it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to</font>

52
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,030
spend too much time on this other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say that the what I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:41,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some graphs to start off with of</font>

55
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:44,469
what happened and we took a TCP dump of

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,590
all the DNS packets and then we bucket

57
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:49,840
bucketed them into one second buckets

58
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so basically have one second</font>

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,780
buckets you count the number of queries

60
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,209
in the bucket and therefore you've got a

61
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,599
request rate in requests per second and

62
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:01,030
then I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of simple spectral</font>

63
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,839
analysis on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well so here's a</font>

64
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:08,530
basic summary of the stats we've got

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:13,659
four datasets 1800 seconds 30 seconds 15

66
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:18,870
seconds and 0 seconds and this column

67
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:20,858
<font color="#CCCCCC">here the fourth column</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shows you all the</font>

68
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,979
number of all the packets that were

69
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:30,370
captured during that seven day period

70
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:32,949
oops right on there and as you can see

71
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,859
this is pretty noisy because as the TTL

72
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:37,989
goes down you would expect the number of

73
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:41,079
DNS packets to increase because it's

74
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:44,259
been the DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries being a response to</font>

75
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:46,209
being cached for less less time but in

76
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:48,339
fact it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes up and then it goes back</font>

77
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">down again and that's just to do with</font>

78
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,250
the noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you get in the DNS data</font>

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,560
so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at all of the of</font>

80
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,530
the packets captured if we select some

81
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known host so then in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

82
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,989
our group of all the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we run</font>

83
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,549
67 servers within our school we get

84
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,259
these numbers on the right here and

85
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:12,489
there you see what you might expect as

86
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:15,728
the TTL decreases the number of DNS

87
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,070
queries you see hitting our servers

88
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,110
increases but in fact you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

89
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,180
with these numbers if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare this</font>

90
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:26,440
final column to the column<font color="#E5E5E5"> just before</font>

91
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:29,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> regardless of whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your DNS detail</font>

92
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:34,150
of 1800 or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 the total number of good</font>

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:37,360
a requests still remains a small

94
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,239
fraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the actual total load on the</font>

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,550
dns server and this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact found in</font>

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,870
the MIT paper that they found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

97
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:49,360
good queries were much smaller a very

98
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,520
small proportion of the total number of

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,780
queries hitting the dns server so

100
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,969
overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going down to 0</font>

101
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,640
TTL the load increase is significant if

102
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,730
you compare it to say 1800 because it's

103
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,830
doubled but overall for the total load

104
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,190
hitting the dns server it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font>

105
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:12,760
increase overall here are just some time

107
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,650

here it's accentuated in this graphic

115
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,810
because it's a log scale but it was it

116
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,260
was actually not a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> proportion of</font>

117
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,660
that week this is what you get at 30

<font color="#E5E5E5">and take some basic stats means etc you</font>

take say 1800 seconds as a baseline here

126
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,430
we had a mean request rate of three in

seconds 20 seconds again it can be seen

as

134
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,030
we can increase compared to 1800 seconds

135
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,750
that it's it's it's more than doubled

136
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:39,030
but overall it's for the total load

to what's possible with with your modern

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,860
distribution of the requests rate so

146
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,929
what I do is I take the one second

147
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,570
buckets and I count<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of times</font>

148
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,900
a bucket of a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> value occurs</font>

149
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:14,760
and I plot that and so I get a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

150
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,549
poor man's periodogram so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

151
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,590
the plot we have for 1800 seconds again

152
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,160
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read this graph as follows it's a</font>

153
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:26,520
log-log scale on the Left we have

154
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,380
normalized<font color="#E5E5E5"> request rates so it's a</font>

155
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,870
request rate normalized over the whole

156
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,030
week and along the bottom we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

157
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,220
query rate again on a log scale so for

158
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,340
example how you would read this point

159
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,490
just here is that saying that twenty

160
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,299
percent of the requests for that week

161
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,190
we're at one request per second or less

162
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,470
so twenty percent of the requests coming

163
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,750
in request for a coming in how you would

164
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,760
read this point here that's saying that

165
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:58,110
about one percent of the requests were

166
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,610
at 10 requests per second or less this

167
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,700
graphic in the bottom right hand corner

168
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,290
is a cumulative distribution of this

169
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,530
thing in the top left hand corner and

170
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,840
again a good point to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take here is on</font>

171
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,510
the bottom axis here is the value 10

172
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,030
what that's saying is that about ninety

173
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:18,240
percent of the queries you were getting

174
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:22,049
in for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,800 second TTL were 10 queries</font>

175
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,990
per second or less<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

176
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,680
at the other TTL value so starting at

177
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:31,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">the top top row that is 30 seconds 15</font>

178
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,810
seconds 0 seconds if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at those</font>

179
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:37,830
graphs you can see some differences as

180
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:40,079
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> move down from 30 seconds 15 seconds</font>

181
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,729
20 seconds but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a huge</font>

182
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference in terms of</font>

183
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,639
I love request if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

184
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,910
cumulative distributions in the right

185
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,040
hand graph you can see this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 is a</font>

186
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,760
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that's still about ninety</font>

187
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,779
percent of the packets coming in are

188
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:02,910
coming in blocked up as ten queries per

189
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:06,000
second or or lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what is</font>

190
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,490
possible if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have dns TTL set to zero</font>

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,470
well as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said my motivation was to use</font>

192
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,570
it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support mobility for this thing</font>

193
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,339
i'm working on called island p in fact

194
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,620
there has been previous work looking at

195
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,449
using dns mobility and related to

196
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,399
ireland p well then we've got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

197
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:25,319
slightly crazy ideas we want to try out

198
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,329
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> island p if we can get low TTL</font>

199
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,170
values to be usable<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

200
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:34,609
through those in in detail but who would

201
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually use low DNS TTL values today</font>

202
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,220
who's crazy enough to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well we</font>

203
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,350
have some crazy yahoo people who were

204
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:47,339
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 60 seconds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i come i uses a</font>

205
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,990
20-second<font color="#E5E5E5"> tto and then at the moment</font>

206
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,990
again just in case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe the</font>

207
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,440
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got our chaps last night to</font>

208
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:58,380
run the whole site again just for you 40

209
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,420
seconds today there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things you</font>

210
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,699
wouldn't do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't this would only</font>

211
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,699
be for edge sites you wouldn't set 0 TTL

212
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:08,670
s44 records higher up in the server

213
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:11,639
hierarchy you would also not do things

214
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:15,139
like use low TTL values for your NS

215
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:18,389
records and for services like email etc

216
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:21,779
you know MX records you need to keep at

217
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:23,370
a higher TTL in fact we did try them

218
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,560
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low tto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have some stories about</font>

219
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:31,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but that will have to wait for</font>

220
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:33,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">another talk so summery 0 TTL for DNS on</font>

221
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:35,459
edge site doesn't seem to be introduced

222
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,219
as much load as you might think and

223
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,888
seems usable and therefore frequent

224
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,010
accesses to DNS servers when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

225
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:47,190
load low TTL seems practical what we

226
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,250
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is see what happens now when</font>

227
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,520
you have secure dynamic dns

228
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,500
update and you have authenticated dns

229
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,240
records what's the additional load on a

230
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,420
server when it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with the</font>

231
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,480
crypto overhead associated with secure

dns<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like to say a very very big</font>

233
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,780
thank you to us this admin group who are

234
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,750
managed to persuade<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the</font>

235
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:11,060
operational settings for what the

settings are<font color="#E5E5E5"> our operational dns server</font>

237
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,869
down to 0 TTL thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention if you may or may not have</font>

239
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,960
time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions but if you want to</font>

240
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">prove yourself that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running at</font>

should find you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get 0 back thank you</font>

244
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:47,479
other any questions no up service so I

245
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,400
was uh Evans<font color="#E5E5E5"> from ISC I was a initially</font>

246
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,040
kind of skeptical of your results until

247
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,020
I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are setting child nodes</font>

248
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,640
rather than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ANA Stella gations and</font>

249
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,900
names or addresses I'd this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

250
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,699
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question but I did want to</font>

251
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,040
emphasize the fact that the DNS would

252
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,570
absolutely collapse if lose if the

253
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,730
infrastructure are here to her hair not

254
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:10,820
cash across the global system yeah

255
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:14,420
agreed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question on</font>

256
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,680
methodology so I've been looking a lot

257
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,160
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where people do</font>

258
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,300
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like science right and</font>

259
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,030
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's can be really dangerous</font>

260
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,250
and in this case what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font>

261
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,589
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are you avoiding finding what</font>

262
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,610
you're looking for in other words you

263
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,260
have a certain kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of confirmation</font>

264
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,300
biased in this whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right because</font>

265
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,710
you want you want it like like the list

266
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,270
people have this to write or they'll

267
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,580
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build a system and</font>

268
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,699
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find data that confirms</font>

269
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,680
what they want it to be right and so the

270
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,450
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> science puts controls on that right</font>

271
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,819
right right so do you have anything

272
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's controlling that she'll say no</font>

273
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,190
it's there's this thing called

274
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,930
confirmation bias in other words right

275
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,970
when you're when you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

276
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,540
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you look real hard a lot</font>

277
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,390
of times you can find it

278
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,569
you're saying do we have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

279
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">show that the load is unacceptable no</font>

280
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,410
it's more like a control on your process

281
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,850
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean do you like there's no</font>

282
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,140
control like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do a real</font>

283
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,800
experiment because there's no control

284
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:14,819
right yeah what so we we thought about

285
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and what we were concerned about</font>

286
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,740
was what would happen on a real

287
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:22,530
operational system so it's very hard I

288
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,060
think to run a control experiment in a

289
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,689
real operational system what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

290
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,310
want to do perhapses get lots of users

291
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,290
using the labs doing a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

292
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,170
thing and then we could be able to

293
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate a control data set okay now</font>

294
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,689
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just impractical your point is</font>

295
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,640
well made but i think it's a it's a

296
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,260
difficult thing to do so we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

297
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,100
next best thing we could do was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

298
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:51,720
change the operational settings assume

299
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:55,880
that on a week by<font color="#E5E5E5"> week basis that the</font>

300
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,770
usage of the system is similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

301
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,630
based on that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that if we</font>

302
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,000
change the TTL that's the only parameter

303
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:05,430
we're changing and so we can make

304
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,260
comparisons across the week now in fact

305
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,790
you will have seen from the time domain

306
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:14,189
data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not true we</font>

307
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this little outage here at 1800</font>

308
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:20,400
seconds there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little peek just hear</font>

309
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact a class test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Iran and</font>

310
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,300
said they were hammering the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server's a</font>

311
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:28,680
little bit so it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to put</font>

312
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:31,560
the control in I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told I'm on</font>

313
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,630
time so thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

314
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,630
much something<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>
