00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:09,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so this is the the more</font>

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,280
operational experience side of the ipv6

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,889
deployment we were lee and i were trying

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not overlap even though our panelists</font>

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,029
could have easily and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that</font>

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,490
overlaps so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our first speaker is John</font>

7
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,400
Rizzo ski I don't know how to say it

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,549
he's a cheap ipv6 architect at comcast

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,470
he works closely with<font color="#CCCCCC"> CableLabs on</font>

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">docsis and packet cable specs which I'm</font>

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:44,760
sure is just tons of fun anyway come on

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:47,070
John<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good morning folks so what I'd</font>

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,019
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do today is is tell a little bit</font>

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,969
about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our real experiences with</font>

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:57,180
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> ip6 related technologies as part</font>

16
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,180
of our trials as I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you</font>

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,890
are aware and hopefully recall we

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,170
announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier this year that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,369
that we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> conduct a number of</font>

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:11,280
ipv6 related trials they many of them

21
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,070
are are actively underway we still have

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,700
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of get underway but</font>

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,080
were nonetheless were very close one on

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,659
kind of having all these different

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,298
activities in flight and I think that's

26
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's important to note and it's also you</font>

27
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,840
know we feel is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to to</font>

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,280
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and share some of that those</font>

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,810
experiences here with you so real quick

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,490
you know you know some some background

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,229
information here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we started the</font>

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,059
program of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Comcast over five years ago</font>

33
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,150
we've taken a very incremental approach

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,909
to enabling v6 today the entire the

35
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,380
entire background is as capable v6 our

36
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,890
back office systems have been fully

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,119
upgraded support v6 and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,340
network is large and capable of

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,439
supporting native ip6 and really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,270
piece that remains<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us is to kind of</font>

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">systematically go through and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

42
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,869
enable it perform any any software

43
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,200
upgrades but from from a hardware point

44
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,340
of view you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we you know we</font>

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,699
believe we have what we need there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,090
kind of kind of take v6 to the next

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,089
level here

48
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,579
the initial focus of the program which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe was actually very important to</font>

50
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,500
how it panned out for us is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we</font>

51
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,060
actually focused initially on device

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,620
management right you know enabling the

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,380
networking infrastructure so that we

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,400
could manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices using v6 we found</font>

55
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that after all that work it was really</font>

56
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,920
in at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our case there's an</font>

57
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,459
incremental opportunity for us to extend

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,970
that and now start to take v6 to you

59
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:46,340
know you guys so that's kind of where we

60
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,250
are now<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these trials and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell</font>

61
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,300
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about them before I do that a</font>

62
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,370
little bit of background it's more

63
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,410
background here so case anybody's wasn't

64
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,750
aware you know when I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> back here we</font>

65
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,650
were in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco or Austin we</font>

66
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,940
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the things that we</font>

67
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,940
had set up from a portal point of view

68
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,640
we added<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new sites here and</font>

69
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,430
basically the top two are our portal for

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,279
the for our v6 activities and the bottom

71
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,170
was are essentially you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> proxied or</font>

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,060
translated versions of the content that

73
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,170
resides on the original versions or the

74
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,900
or the origin versions of those sites

75
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,690
one very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> point to note we we</font>

76
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,390
recently closed the registrations for

77
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,570
the trials but prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to doing so we had</font>

78
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,329
over 7,000 people sign up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate</font>

79
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,090
which we were very happy about we

80
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought that was a very important data</font>

81
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:44,230
point and hugely relevant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to at work</font>

82
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,549
so again background<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little bit more</font>

83
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,260
more background here but uh you know

84
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font>

85
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our underlying infrastructure was</font>

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,200
able to support you know it was parody

87
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,940
we have between v4 and v6 for us you

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,780
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the preference is you know</font>

89
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,250
it for the ipv6 to be native versus you

90
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">know other types of techniques I think</font>

91
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,440
we all you know understand or very soon

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,060
will understand more about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

93
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,320
the pros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cons of the different</font>

94
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,709
approaches are but<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our point of</font>

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,019
view our you know our preference is to

96
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:21,019
use to leverage native connectivity to

97
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,000
offer to offer services to folks and

98
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,049
again you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know one of the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,020
main goals of what we are

100
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,940
after is to you know enable it you know

101
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,120
again verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everything is working</font>

102
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,650
as designed and identify gaps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

103
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,180
sure that you know we don't there are no

104
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,789
surprises right and we think that that

105
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,340
really it's important for everybody who

106
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:43,068
is deploying v6 to do this sooner rather

107
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,378
than later these<font color="#E5E5E5"> findings are there</font>

108
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:46,280
they're like diamonds in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rough there</font>

109
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:50,960
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font>

110
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">out now and not a year from now and of</font>

111
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that extends into the</font>

112
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,479
home you know the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us is to make</font>

113
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,830
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we go into you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

114
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,419
extend services to folks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

115
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">more about this later that we understand</font>

116
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the impact into subscriber doing is</font>

117
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,490
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be right we have to make sure</font>

118
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,650
that that are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the you know</font>

119
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,780
guiding principles of the program of

120
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,150
comcast is to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we that it</font>

121
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,729
is seamless right so our our goal is

122
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:20,120
into is to really actively try them you

123
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:21,680
know disrupt or break things and yeah so

124
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what's going to go alongside with</font>

125
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,259
that is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get is to make sure</font>

126
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in addition to having the</font>

127
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,319
infrastructure ready and available that

128
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,370
we have content and services available

129
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,930
or v6 as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of switch</font>

130
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,020
gears a little bit talk about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

131
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:40,130
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charles 624 was something that we</font>

132
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:42,680
had added to our activities after our

133
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,529
initial announcement we had done some

134
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,169
preparation work you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font>

135
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:51,710
know you know the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> spring time</font>

136
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:54,740
frame that led us to really pay a lot

137
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,349
more attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 64 I won't bore you</font>

138
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,759
with a lot of details on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 is I</font>

139
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">think most everybody in this room knows</font>

140
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,810
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is but essentially it is the</font>

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:16,279
bum rap for a variety of reasons and

145
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:20,120
I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> guilty of offering it the bum</font>

146
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:22,550
rap it's a on occasion as well so the

147
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,949
deal is for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know we saw that</font>

148
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,840
there is this you know enormous amount

149
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:32,839
of opportunity here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know</font>

150
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,859
leverage 624<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add to the things that</font>

151
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,990
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn as a relates to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a be 60</font>

152
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,759
you know and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence by you know</font>

153
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,289
some home routers that have it on by

154
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,899
default and supported many popular

155
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,009
operating systems etcetera<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc the fact</font>

156
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:50,059
that it's on by default is actually

157
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:51,469
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key point here and the real</font>

158
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:54,409
deal I think for everybody in the room

159
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:55,789
here is and I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Martin</font>

160
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,949
would probably agree with me here is

161
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:59,779
it's a it's out there whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

162
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you whether you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to acknowledge</font>

163
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,740
it or not it's happening right so you

164
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,889
know you might want to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

165
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,589
actually doing something to to to handle

166
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:12,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know we did and I'll tell you a</font>

167
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:16,369
little about that so we basically

168
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:18,949
deployed a handful of Linux page 64

169
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:21,199
relays currently there are four running

170
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,599
they'll be a fifth running here

171
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,619
hopefully in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Atlanta area before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

172
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,289
end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year and one of the things</font>

173
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:33,499
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had learned about the you know</font>

174
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,240
the use of the Linux platform is the

175
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:38,089
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time we went to go turn it up</font>

176
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,249
it was about a 15-minute maintenance

177
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:42,559
window because the kernel panic

178
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:44,659
basically brought everything to a

179
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:47,119
screeching halt for that night so once

180
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:48,949
we get everything squared away you know

181
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:51,709
and this was a again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux based</font>

182
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,610
platform the actual turn up of these of

183
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">these relays was actually very</font>

184
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,300
straightforward there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely some</font>

185
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,849
tweaks to be had to make for you know

186
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,769
different client you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you</font>

187
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:04,128
know client-side<font color="#E5E5E5"> our home gateway side</font>

188
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:05,990
64 invitations but<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day is done it</font>

189
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:09,759
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good you know fairly</font>

190
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:12,319
straightforward and honestly the

191
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,930
reduction in latency was substantial

192
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,579
right it was easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty percent so the</font>

193
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,319
message you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my point of view</font>

194
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,459
is is you know if you're not if you're

195
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,079
not thinking about the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> suits for</font>

196
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,369
relays and you have lots of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

197
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network that have you know</font>

198
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:28,789
equipment that supports<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you might</font>

199
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:30,409
want to revisit that and again it is it

200
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:33,708
is able<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it is enabled by</font>

201
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:35,899
default in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places and one of</font>

202
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,789
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did observe and you</font>

203
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:41,029
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is fairly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious but as part</font>

204
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,529
of enabling the 64 2.64 relays you know

205
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,870
because they are now on our network we

206
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,010
actually were able to achieve some of

207
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">our you know</font>

208
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,670
further achieve some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our objectives</font>

209
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,890
in that now we had native traffic more

210
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,300
native traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> a substantial increase in</font>

211
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,040
native traffic across our across our

212
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,140
network which was which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

213
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,819
important to us and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's these</font>

214
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,180
are things that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be valuable for</font>

215
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:05,570
everybody to to learn about so sick

216
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,780
sardine a little bit about six rd<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

217
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,150
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much you know a lot of folks</font>

218
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,699
may or may not know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'sit's you</font>

219
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:17,840
know similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six to four but it</font>

220
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,730
offers a number of improvements one of

221
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges that we have 64 is you</font>

222
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,090
know the use of the anycast addresses

223
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,700
and the fact that there are like piles

224
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,020
of up and relays out there that yeah

225
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,030
some are some are managed better than

226
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,240
others but after the day is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part</font>

227
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:34,430
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why it's it's often</font>

228
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,500
frowned upon but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with six rd</font>

229
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,120
we have the you know we have a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

230
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,320
control you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I price of information</font>

231
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,640
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

232
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,810
information about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft and you</font>

233
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably heard about it earlier this</font>

234
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:49,699
morning again we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> encapsulated v6</font>

235
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:51,680
packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> or over over before but the key</font>

236
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,570
benefit the six rd and maybe it doesn't

237
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,640
apply as much to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it may apply to</font>

238
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,050
other folks here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really it was</font>

239
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,790
very fairly straightforward to deploy

240
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,729
for us it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar to the 64</font>

241
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,599
relays and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks who have challenges</font>

242
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,830
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> access network for ipv6 native</font>

243
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,080
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really something that you know you</font>

244
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:12,050
ought to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at at a bare</font>

245
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,840
minimum test and really consider for

246
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:19,219
your you know for your v6 deployment

247
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:21,320
program is uh you know it yielded some

248
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,390
of the same benefits that we had some

249
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,340
the same benefits that we had was 64 and

250
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,720
it helped us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase the native ipv6</font>

251
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:31,280
traffic across the backbone but one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that we did have to do is we</font>

253
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,360
had to we had to really do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

254
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,060
with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors and the open</font>

259
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,380
them out there we have to do some manual

260
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,910
configuration and that's where thing

261
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,470
because in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our in our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure and</font>

262
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,640
in a device themselves there are some

263
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,600
DCP bits that were not kind of aligning

264
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,370
but in fairness I

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:06,360
those things are going to very soon work

266
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:08,370
themselves out the huh<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok ok so I'll</font>

267
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,009
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly jump to the one point</font>

of your board of relays very important

performance and latency are all things

that you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll kind</font>

it's it's it's where we're going to

start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it one of the biggest</font>

challenges that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this front is</font>

308
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,269
really orchestrating all the you know

309
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,730
the software upgrades and figuration

310
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,769
which is in some cases business usual

311
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,569
but because it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit on the on the</font>

312
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,790
bleeding edge here you know where we're

313
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:49,740
taking a very incremental approach so

314
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:53,339
last but not least before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get thrown</font>

off here and Catholic is mad at me one

316
00:12:53,339 --> 00:13:00,269
of the biggest things that we see still

317
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:03,420
where we have some some some gaps is you

318
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:04,649
know content right yeah we we have to

319
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,689
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything that we do is</font>

his current fake title of the month is

basically means<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm AG people to make</font>

344
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:16,120
about just some experiences that

research and education institutions I'm

346

gonna call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed use for sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

347

348
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,350
over but we call them Edu's are having

349
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,570
with deploying ipv6 or more

350
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,070
appropriately adopting ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>

351
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,740
give an example of the UC Berkeley

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:33,330
wireless network so I did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

353
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,830
matrix here of ipv6 deployment

354
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,500
preparedness at this point along two

355
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,360
axes of service enablement and client

356
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,010
enablement and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

357
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,900
also point out is a lot of the regional

358
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,490
networks regional are any networks are

359
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,319
sort of down in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this area of regional</font>

360
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,840
and national<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any networks they're</font>

361
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,580
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good well off in terms of ipv6</font>

362
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,560
they can provide ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their clients</font>

363
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and clients and most of them have</font>

364
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,469
enabled ipv6 on their services so that

365
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:02,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">includes things like magpie max kalrind</font>

366
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:06,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cameron more net or net and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

367
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:10,510
ones like I peds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to nlr</font>

368
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,490
and es net so a lot of what we are

369
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving for is sort of a native dual</font>

370
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,880
stack type configuration that allows us

371
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the ipv4 address</font>

00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:25,279
and provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more gradual transition to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">use as most people now have enough ipv4</font>

376
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:32,029
address space we're not in big trouble

377

<font color="#E5E5E5">with that and we do want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to adopt ipv6</font>

379
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:38,089
the reasons you see here i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">divide the rest of the talk into two</font>

was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we what we did</font>

389
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,929
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past year is we abated an old</font>

390
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:06,079
captive portal system that was end of

391
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:09,439
life and had some problems it did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

392
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:12,559
support ipv6 and we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a big</font>

393
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:14,719
problem with rogue arrays in ipv6 um

394
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,269
being announced in our captive portal

395
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,579
system even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't Dino didn't</font>

396
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,979
support ipv6 so I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that in</font>

397
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,618
a minute but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did is we decided</font>

398
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:27,019
to roll our own captive portal system we

399
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:29,089
had this big problem with ipv4 address

400
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,069
burn rate because what was happening is

401
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,449
people would come onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network they</font>

402
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,949
would associate with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless</font>

403
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,539
network and they would get an ipv4

404
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,738
globally routable address even though

405
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,749
they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> used the network and they</font>

406
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:40,129
never authenticated to it so there was

407
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,899
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for them to have that address</font>

408
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:43,909
they just happen to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile device</font>

409
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:45,319
that had a wireless antenna and it

410
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:47,239
happened to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be turned on and happened to</font>

411
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the address so we wanted to get rid</font>

412
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:51,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and our solution was one-to-one</font>

413
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:53,478
nat basically you get an RFC 1918

414
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:55,609
address and then once you authenticate

415
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:58,039
that gets bound to an ipv4 globally

416
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:59,509
routable address and based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some of</font>

417
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">the presentations this morning you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

418
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:02,629
see a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit as to why we did that</font>

419
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,398
it actually allowed us to reclaim a lot

420
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:06,139
of address space but didn't give us all

421
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,638
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problems that you heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

this morning with regard to shared a

conserve even more address space it also

428
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:23,599
once you authenticate it turns on ipv6

429
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:25,549
as a bridge so basically the captive

430

portal bridges v6 connectivity to you

431
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,950
you get end-to-end native v6 if you have

436
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,260
systems that have connection sharing

turned on some cases unbeknownst to the

actual user of that system and all it

439
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,620
needs is a globally routable ipv4

440
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,409
address or in some cases even a private

445
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,510
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have your ipv6 default here</font>

446
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,830
send all your ipv6 traffic through me

447
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,570
and what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up with is a case where</font>

448
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,189
your ipv6 traffic is effectively blocked

449
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,129
and you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout and then fall</font>

450
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,660
over to ipv4 this happens a lot on

451
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,910
wireless networks in some cases even

452
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,230
happens on conference networks I'll let

an example of me having to get up at

456
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:26,340
somebody's breaking all of our ipv6

ended up doing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our ipv6</font>

459
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,070

460
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,280
natively which helps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of force</font>

461
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,560
out some of that bad rogue<font color="#CCCCCC"> 624</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff</font>

462
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,170
that gets the bum rap or that causes 6

463
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,780
24 in general to get the bum rap but we

464
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,820
also took the router announcement

465
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,840
priority field which has an incredibly

466
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:52,139
granular option of low medium and high

467
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,000
and we turned our routers so they would

468
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,550
announce our a's with the priority of

469
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,100
high and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would trump all of the</font>

other ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the default realm</font>

which is medium<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know why anyone</font>

472
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,680
would ever use low because of mediums

473
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,150
the default there's really no reason

474

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,280
want people routing through your device

rid of them from<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually causing a</font>

own 624 relay routers that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

495
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,840
to do a little bit more control over the

00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,059
traffic they know where it's going and

497
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,678
they can also selectively block ipv6

498
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:03,770
traffic making sure they send back

499
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,630
icmpv6 responses so that the traffic

500
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,850
will stop and failover immediately to

501
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,590
ipv4 since most operating systems will

502
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,230
do that they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeout if they see</font>

an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPM icmpv6 unreachable they'll</font>

504
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,279
immediately failover to ipv4 so that's

505
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,600
one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of stop that one or</font>

506
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,370
another way i should<font color="#CCCCCC"> say to kind of stop</font>

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,799
that 624 stuff from<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening if you</font>

509
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,870
Edu's out there the block IP protocol 41

510
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,908
which is the ipv4 tunnel side of 624 and

511
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">other types of tunnels that's a bad idea</font>

512
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:32,179
because you're dropping traffic on the

513
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,129
floor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're giving no signaling</font>

514
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,450
back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host that their traffic is</font>

515
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,610
being blocked on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor dropped on</font>

516
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,679
the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they have to now timeout</font>

517
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,070
and go back to ipv4 and that just makes

518
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,299
a big mess for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client I'll let you</font>

really much to it other than this is

521
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,980
sort of some of our experiences in

522
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,899
running our own sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 624 relays</font>

523
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,020
sometimes you've had universities which

524
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:55,820
try to leap their wraps to their<font color="#CCCCCC"> offsite</font>

providers sometimes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> offsite provider</font>

526
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,720
happens to be somebody big like Comcast

527
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,580
or someone else and then you end up

528
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,169
sucking in a lot more 624 traffic than

529
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,610
you thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were so comcast of</font>

their own 64 relays and that's helped

532
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,149
out a lot on to give us you know a

little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more symmetry in the 624</font>

540
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,529
say about this is we did have a set of

RA<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ApS that had a very very good</font>

549
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,690
that are maliciously coming in and they

550
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,730
decide to set their route priority<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

551

552
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,750
some of our traffic so we like our

access points that only

554
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,400
and switches that only allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> our a</font>

announcements from a designated port

556

which is where the upstream router is

557
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,090
that's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP snooping so</font>

558
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,290
it's basically our DHCP snooping for Ras

559
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,350
and there's already an internet draft

out about this these particular devices

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,810
gave them nice shiny globally routable

568
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:31,370
ipv6 addresses which they would try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

569
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:33,649
use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us are also even putting up</font>

570
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,239
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> teredo relays I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

571
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really not very interesting</font>

572
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,000
because you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find much</font>

573
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,560
happening in tirado because tirado is

574
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,060
supposed to be used as an absolute last

575
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,610
resort if there's no ipv4 connectivity

576
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,260
out there well it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out during</font>

577
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,370
breaks during this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said oh I'm</font>

578
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,860
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set up a trade oh right</font>

579
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,179
relay on Berkeley's campus and start

580
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,949
sucking in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trade Oh routes and see</font>

581
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,570
what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm now seeing with our</font>

582
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,100
native wireless network that we've set

583
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,870
up I'm now seeing a lot of peer-to-peer

584
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,189
what looks like peer-to-peer traffic I

585
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,419
don't really know what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm</font>

586
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually seeing a fair amount of traffic</font>

587
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through trade oh so that's kind of</font>

588
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,340
interesting that's not something I

589
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,570
expect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen but it is</font>

590
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,709
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kinds of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

591
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,510
learn about what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

592
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,430
network when you have these relays<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

593
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,860
you set up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 624 relays and the Teredo</font>

594
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:15,500
relays so that's basically it in

595
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,419
conclusion dual stack is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead a lot</font>

596
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,160
of us here in the edu community are

597
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,590
still trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do dual stack sometimes</font>

598
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,300
with some sort of ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat augmentation</font>

599
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,709
like we did with our wireless network in

600
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,240
some cases we're just doing straight

601
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,620
native dual stack which is what a lot of

602
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">us are doing in our residential networks</font>

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,639
at this point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> berkeley is hoping to</font>

00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that we have some management</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tools</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">network engineer hello thanks um I</font>

620
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,240
realized I did not put a background

<font color="#CCCCCC">familiar with what limelight has</font>

623
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,340
endeavored to do over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple</font>

624
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:31,760
years in the ipv6 space i'll briefly run

625
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:35,270
over our efforts there our initiative

626
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,158
started in the core<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

627
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,039
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should back up and point out for</font>

628
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,990
those that aren't aware limelight is

629
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:46,070
somewhat<font color="#CCCCCC"> unique as a CD in as it has its</font>

630
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:48,500
own core network<font color="#CCCCCC"> modeled very much after</font>

631
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,889
a traditional service provider IP

632
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,740
backbone where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd expect to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see and</font>

633
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,580
do see the traditional elements

634
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,000
architectural elements that are present

635
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">in that that's set up so we started out</font>

636
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,460
our initiative with what we consider to

637
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,590
be perhaps the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest portion of</font>

638
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,919
the ipv6 adoption process which is

639
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,840
getting ipv6 in the core that started in

640
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,659
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of 2008 and by the end</font>

641
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">of 2008 we had v6 in the core and we're</font>

642
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:20,750
routing ipv6 traffic over the next few

643
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,940
months in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning of 2009 we</font>

644
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,190
started bringing up v6 transit sessions

645
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,480
to those transit providers that offered

646
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,490
v6 routes as well as a significant a

647
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,870
relatively significant amount of v6

648
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,590
peering at considering what was

649
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:39,459
available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this work</font>

650
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:43,699
in the core was then followed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

651
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,890
enough edge work to culminate in a

652
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,960
proof-of-concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo with Netflix where</font>

653
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,640
we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver netflix watch it</font>

654
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,990
now traffic over v6 and this is a

655
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">service that's still up and running</font>

656
00:25:50,990 --> 00:26:01,100
today so getting to that point we had

657
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:03,140
what are probably traditional concerns

658
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,969
in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the ipv6 adoption</font>

659
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,590
process for anybody in the room which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

660
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,990
primarily make maintaining stability in

661
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,658
the existing production<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and we</font>

662
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">endeavor to do that by trying to</font>

663
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:17,190
carefully select what what routing

664
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,010
protocols we were going to use and

665
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:23,830
carefully making sure that our existing

666
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,809
edge architecture was primed to support

667
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,750
whatever mechanisms we had to put in

668
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:30,580
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deliver v6 traffic we were</font>

669
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,070
mostly successful in that we ran into

670
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,830
some bumps and I've got here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

671
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,210
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide a basic breakdown of some of</font>

672
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,799
the architectural and organizational

673
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,090
challenges that we face so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font>

674
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the art of the architectural ones</font>

675
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:45,158
first one of the bumps that we ran into

676
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">is in the process of selecting a routing</font>

677
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:51,600
protocol at the time our vendor only

678
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:55,149
offered a single topology mode of is is

679
00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:00,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we were using is is and the ipv4</font>

680
00:26:55,149 --> 00:27:02,799
domain there was a lot of interest and

681
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:06,940
determination to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we</font>

682
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,220
leveraged our knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

683
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,880
with is is and the v6 domain as well so

684
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,890
the the trick there is that in single

685
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,860
topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> mothers there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single SPF</font>

686
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,570
calculated for both v4 and v6 so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

687
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,270
v4 production<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you can definitely</font>

688
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">run into some turbulence if if you're</font>

689
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,580
addressing schemes aren't correct on

690
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,639
interfaces and SPF recalculations occur

691
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,110
so we got out fairly easy you know

692
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,399
they're a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of events where there</font>

693
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,418
was some turbulence on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network as a</font>

694
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:40,209
result of that and now the vendor has

695
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:45,789
finally caught up to providing dual

696
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:47,260
topology mode is is which it leaves one

697
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,490
and that you know for myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind</font>

698
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,080
of like well thanks I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have used</font>

699
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,600
that two years ago but you know now that

700
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,510
we're already completely integrated into

701
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,270
single topology is is if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a</font>

702
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,520
difficult proposition to think about

703
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,830
transitioning into dual topology and go

704
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,820
through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same challenges and</font>

705
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,779
struggles that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through in the</font>

706
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:09,189
first place with selecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp so</font>

707
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:10,779
and that falls under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general</font>

708
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,200
category of dealing with vendor

709
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:13,200
readiness

710
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:21,510
so one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we continue to</font>

711
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,330
run into issues with vendor readiness on

712
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network side and on the course ID</font>

713
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:31,178
one issue in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may be of</font>

714
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:34,510
interest to some folks is line cards

715
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:40,470
that that have cam space for both ipv4

716
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:44,760
and ipv6 space ipv4 and ipv6 routes

717
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:49,299
we've run into an instance where we have

718
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:53,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">cam space divided up to give us 384</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kv4</font>

720
00:28:53,049 --> 00:29:00,010

721
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:01,780
that's obviously problematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a core</font>

726
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:12,220
around 330 k routes approximately and

727
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,290
you realize that you've only got

728
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Headroom of about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> k more routes on</font>

729
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:21,970
the v4 side and then add to that that

730
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:25,450
you've got v6 prefix cam allocation for

731
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:27,970
128 k v6 routes which seems quite like

732
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:31,900
overkill if if we do v6 correctly and

733
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:34,510
leverage the the aggregation promise

734
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,340
that it offers so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an example of an</font>

issue that you know we continue to face

00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:44,260
even as we go forward with you know with

741
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll briefly go over some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font>

742
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,970
that we faced internally and these are

743
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,370
not unique I'm sure a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of folks here</font>

744
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">who are dealing with the ipv6 adoption</font>

745
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,590
challenge have have run into the same

746
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,090
some of the same issues we're lucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

747
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:09,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">limelite we're very forward-leaning we</font>

748
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:11,799
have to be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CD in space it's very</font>

749
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,570
focused on on evolution and adapting to

750
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:16,059
you know the emerging internet

751
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,668
environment to deliver services and to

752
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:21,160
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> money off delivering those services</font>

753
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:23,330
so you know management<font color="#CCCCCC"> by off was never</font>

754
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,400
really the problem i mean i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we had</font>

755
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:28,040
commitment from from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> highest levels</font>

756
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,840
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization very early that we</font>

757
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,590
would do v6 and we would you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

758
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,810
would we would lead in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that space but</font>

759
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:39,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we find out is that management by</font>

760
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,940
off and allocation of resources are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

761
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,200
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing and and I</font>

762
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,270
know that you know every organization

763
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,010
struggles with this it's you only have

764
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:48,980
so many hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the day and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so many</font>

765
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">personnel to to tackle tackle</font>

766
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,590
initiatives and so part of the issue is

767
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,720
that you know what we're all witnessing

768
00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:00,800
in terms of the lack of content

769
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,290
available in v6 by virtue of some of the

770
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,990
technical challenges that we face makes

771
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,700
it difficult to make a business case

772
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:10,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would then Alec</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that within align</font>

773
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:14,600
resources to in the organization to

774
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:16,190
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> b6 in a much more rapid way so</font>

775
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,320
that continues to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge and</font>

776
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,600
that's something that that I'm sure that

777
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,620
you know will continue to see as as a

778
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,669
challenge so for us it's really about

779
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,979
internally in our organization getting

780
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,110
ipv6 you know having<font color="#E5E5E5"> in folks in the</font>

781
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,650
organization who are ipv6 evangelists

782
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,879
and getting them to carry the message to

783
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,460
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> various parts of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization</font>

784
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this challenge is not going to go</font>

785
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:44,960
away you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't ignore you know the fact</font>

786
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:47,709
that that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have turbulence</font>

787
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,510
in delivering v4 services based on on

788
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,550
address exhaustion and what we're after

789
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,230
at limelight is quite simply just parity

790
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:57,710
between everything that we offer in the

791
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,150
vc force base and and being able to make

792
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,000
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that functions in a v6</font>

793
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,010
environment a v6 before environment with

794
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,440
you know something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carrie right now</font>

795
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,440
in the middle or any combination thereof

796
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,090
so

797
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:21,170
and then finally as part of that it

798
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,629
really what what I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to accomplish</font>

799
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:28,400
this your organizationally at limelight

800
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:32,360
is to really pin down where the demand

801
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:34,850
is and isn't from customers I know a lot

802
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,040
of customers know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should care</font>

803
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,959
about v6 they've been told that they've

804
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,360
read it they've heard it apocryphal<font color="#CCCCCC"> E</font>

805
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily be feeling</font>

806
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,419
the pain yet of not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live</font>

807
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,520
or v6 traffic in fact you know we're

808
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,169
pretty much sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not and</font>

809
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,120
when we do get inquiries<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

810
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:53,059
definitely try to lead that dance with

811
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,830
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make them aware of the the</font>

812
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,120
emerging challenges that are coming from

813
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">V for exhaustion if they're not already</font>

814
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:03,979
aware of them what we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to find out</font>

815
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:07,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">is is what drives their interest and and</font>

816
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:10,870
or lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interest in v6 adoption and</font>

817
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:15,919
and try to try to build a you know a

818
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:17,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful database for extracting we're two</font>

best focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> the energies in the</font>

820

821
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,770
best and fastest way possible for you

822
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,000
know for our critical customers and for

823
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,490
the services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they want to deliver</font>

824
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,020
so that continues to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a challenge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

825
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that will will</font>

826
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,730
continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on this year and that's</font>

827
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,730
about all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have so thank you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

828
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:47,030
next up we have Lorenzo khleevi from I'm

829
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:50,750
networking at Google he got to write his

830
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:52,879
master's thesis on ipv6 and ipv4 tunnel

831
00:33:50,750 --> 00:34:00,679
discovery and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet sounds pretty</font>

832
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">exciting hey so um I'm going to talk a</font>

833
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,890
little bit about what we've done and

834
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we found to work and what doesn't</font>

835
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:12,950
so for those who don't know we've been

836
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing ipv6 for a while we started in</font>

837
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,960
mid-2007 really we started with some

838
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,970
network engineering and software

839
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,560
engineering and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a year and a</font>

840
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:24,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">half we brought v62 most of our major</font>

841
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:31,009
services and they're available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

842
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:32,389
Google over ipv6 program so it's it

843
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,149
didn't took it didn't take that much

844
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:38,330
work to actually do this it was a with a

845
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:39,888
small team the strategy was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a</font>

846
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,210
gradual approach the idea is that if you

847
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,770
do it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hurry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to cost you</font>

848
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,389
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money you're going to have you</font>

849
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,918
might actually have to end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up folk</font>

850
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:49,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifting hardware and we just didn't want</font>

851
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so we took a very very slow</font>

852
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:53,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> measured approach we hadn't you know</font>

853
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:56,330
handful of people or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> less just</font>

854
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:58,069
slowly chipping away we got v6 ins and

855
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,920
requirements in when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we changed</font>

856
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,330
our hardware and when vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> approached</font>

857
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,040
are saying oh we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great new</font>

858
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:07,160
product that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does be sick we said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok not</font>

859
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,109
interested but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vendors that said we</font>

860
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,819
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> support ipv6 we said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well we're</font>

861
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:14,090
not going to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you unless you do</font>

862
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:15,920
so so we worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the outside in and</font>

863
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:19,430
when we started it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was basically nothing</font>

864
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,900
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there of any size so what we</font>

865
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,339
did was we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user facing</font>

866
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,730
services and we made them available

867
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,109
starting with ipv6 or google com you

868
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,850
know starting just at the load balancer

869
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:30,440
and then progressively going up to

870
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:33,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">software stacks until we reach the</font>

871
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,570
applications and and and that was

872
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,330
essential to actually get some user

873
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,920
traffic and make the software developers

874
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,470
understand this thing was real and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

875
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,730
this traffic was coming in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gave</font>

876
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:48,410
us a source of traffic that we could use

877
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:49,790
to actually run our services on so we

878
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,799
used a shim layer to protect our

879
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,450
applications we basically take the v6

880
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,339
address

881
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:58,660
rip<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the user modifiable bits and</font>

882
00:35:54,339 --> 00:36:00,400
hash it into multicast space which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

883
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,259
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really enabled us to</font>

884
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,940
advance without having all of our code

885
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,599
all of our applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> all our systems</font>

886
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:09,040
understand v6 this as a few undesirable

887
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,460
properties notably breaks to your

888
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,690
location but it really is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the key</font>

889
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that allowed us to make progress</font>

890
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,980
sometimes it's not perfect and one point

891
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,910
gmail was telling you your last login is

892
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:24,099
from this multicast v4 address so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

894
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,579
to make it as similar to v4 as possible

895
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,650
that way you don't you don't have to

896
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:32,320
retrain your NOC you don't have to do

897
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,359
anything and and dual stack everything

898
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,410
you can because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a stack it's</font>

899
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,869
going to scale by itself it's

900
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:40,029
operationally supported so for example

901
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:42,280
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is probably</font>

902
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,930
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you use one protocol one NGP and</font>

903
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,180
that's what we chose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you're using</font>

904
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:49,960
ice ice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using you know single</font>

905

topology is for everything we use before

906
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,079
to carry before and v6 to carry v6 we

907
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,759
don't want faith sharing between

908
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,310
protocols we want things to blow up

909
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:01,710
independently if they blow up and we

910
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:05,529
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to be very useful and</font>

911
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:07,000
implementations yes so they mostly kind

912
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,290
of work they mostly kind of say what

913
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,599
they do but they have bugs because

914
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:13,300
nobody's ever really kick the tires and

915
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,339
so don't expect stuff to work just

916
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's supported because it'll not</font>

917
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:19,839
likely it's likely that nobody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

918
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:23,010
used it before you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know put in a</font>

919
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,328
lab test it and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find the bug</font>

920
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,980
don't stop testing don't wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

921
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:29,500
vendor code maintenance release to fix

it find the next bug because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guarantee</font>

923
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,180
you that it's there and so repeat rinse

924
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,890
and repeat there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many more bugs to</font>

925
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:39,250
find and you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to fix them</font>

926
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,598
one by one and what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we found</font>

927
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,849
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you can produce</font>

928
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,980
a workaround it's actually acceptable

929
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:46,720
for production then put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

930
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,550
production because the bugs are really

931
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,950
hard to find you can only find<font color="#E5E5E5"> them at</font>

932
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">production so for example I mean these</font>

933
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,540
are a choice examples of bugs if a

934
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,000
firewall filter term has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1-bit match</font>

935
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,550
in bits 32 to 64<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a two-bit</font>

00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,310
platform this code

938
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:06,279
then it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work now I</font>

939
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:09,799
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to find that in your lap</font>

in a febrile rib get out of sync in

941

943
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,450
this may be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit easier but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

944
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:20,990
know it's hard to find duplicate address

945
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:24,529
detection is kind of a you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> medium</font>

946
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">sized headache on our vendor you</font>

947
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:29,120
basically have to deactivate the

948
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:32,000
interface configuration put it back when

949
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,529
you trigger dad and that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

950
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,360
problem right so we ended up disabling

951
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:39,230
it so again are you going to find this

952
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:41,660
in lab maybe but maybe not so what's not

953
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:44,330
working so so our infrastructure is

954
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,799
basically pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> stable at this point we</font>

955
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,600
were able to offer most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the services</font>

956
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,430
now it's in including<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube now it's</font>

959
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:58,670
have it and and so if it's a slow slow

960

963
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,430
happens is that typically operating

00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,710
systems will try pv6 first and then

965
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,589
they'll fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to v4 but in some</font>

cases the fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to before will be</font>

967
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,420
slow typically if the host tries v6 and

00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:19,430
it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a default route doesn't</font>

holds it very bad and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

989
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,350
due to home gateway behavior I mean

990
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,120
certain models of home gateways have

991
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,920
been known to turn on 64 with a private

992
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv4 address on</font>

993
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,380
on the land side nobody explained to

994
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,299
them that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible it's never going</font>

995
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:18,619
to work but you it's turned on<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

996
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:22,309
default you can't disable it so you know

997
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:24,770
and even if you have both native and 6

998
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:26,299
24 in your home your host might end up

999
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,069
using 624 because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font>

1000
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick the first River advertisement that</font>

1001
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:34,670
it chooses and this will break things so

1002
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:37,640
another thing hosts may choose to prefer

1003
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,190
624 over ipv4 well guess what before is

1004
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:44,480
more reliable because 624 it is at best

1005
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:46,490
as reliable as before and so this was a

1006
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,839
known issue in RFC 348 for most

1007
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,419
application developers have worked

1008
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,890
around it windows worked around it opera

1009
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,980
worked around it had never had this

1010
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:58,759
problem the mac is now working around it

1011
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:01,069
we expect those we expect those fixes to

1012
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,660
roll very soon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's broken</font>

1013
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:04,670
firewalls as those all sorts of things

1014
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">and basically again it's nobody's ever</font>

1015
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,299
really kick the tires there's a very

1016
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,880
very low level of background noise<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1017
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">is my favorite it's um it's um don't</font>

1018
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,430
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the MAC addresses I didn't scrub</font>

1019
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:18,230
them out but it's a home gateway

1020
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,640
advertising v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> which ability and telling</font>

1021
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:23,510
the hosts on the local net that they

1022
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,098
have a prefix of 0 0 0 0 / 64 that

1023
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,809
that's brilliant in itself it's not a

1024
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:28,220
unicast address if I were the OS

1025
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:31,730
implementation it wouldn't accept such a

1026
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,430
prefix but the OS accepts the prefix of

1027
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:36,500
0000 and it tries to connect and the

1028
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rooter sends back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no you don't have a</font>

1032
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:48,950
five more addresses to try so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1033
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,930
know waits for 24 seconds and this is

1034
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,149
completely broken a normal part in all

1035
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:57,020
parts of it but this is we saw this in

1036
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:58,910
real life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user had this issue so</font>

1037
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have some numbers of this we use a</font>

1038
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,799
variant of the JavaScript experiment the

1039
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,920
various other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are using we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1040
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:09,859
decently sized data set but there's a

1041
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,990
lot of noise in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data and we're not</font>

1042
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:13,670
exactly sure there's there's a lot of

1043
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:16,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">different effects in that may contribute</font>

1044
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:18,079
if you filter out the data and you only

1045
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,579
look at stuff that's very clean that we

1046
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,339
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

1047
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:24,529
these are the numbers so for the

1048
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:28,390
internet it's gone down from 0.09

1049
00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:31,969
percent to 0.08 to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

1050
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:34,219
and so other than other numbers are

1051
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:36,049
similar we have a blind spot for

1052
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:40,099
whitelist ISPs people that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1053
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:41,989
the Google over ipv6 program so for them

1054
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,459
if they have broken v6 they can't reach

1055
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:45,459
us and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> measure that</font>

1056
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:47,749
we plan to fix this by putting

1057
00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:49,609
measurements on a host that's not part

1058
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:52,069
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Google over ipv6 program host</font>

1059
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:54,700
without a v6 address<font color="#E5E5E5"> another network so</font>

1060
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:58,719
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measure that as well and</font>

1061
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:01,218
so the good news is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away Mac</font>

1062
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,589
she sort of excluded from the results

1063
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:08,029
you get into four nines territory which

1064
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:12,769
isn't too bad it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still the</font>

1065
00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:14,690
kind of level of reliability that that

1066
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:16,808
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you know that need to make</font>

1067
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:20,390
this call are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of uncomfortable with</font>

1068
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:21,559
but it's better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 30 and 39 s or so</font>

1069
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know half that you'd have you know</font>

1070
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,549
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you cancer the mac and as the</font>

1071
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,319
fixes role will see how real fast they

1072
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:31,099
roll out we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the numbers are</font>

1073
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:33,259
looking like over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but again</font>

1074
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:35,269
there is persistent low level brokenness

1075
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:37,190
the only way to fix this really is is in

1076
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:39,828
the OS stack because the home gateways

1077
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,479
never get upgraded you know they often

1078
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:44,089
they're on firmware upgrades available

1079
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:46,578
for them nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> oppressor himoto they</font>

1080
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:48,529
don't know what the problem is and even

1081
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:50,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know when they see this problem what</font>

1082
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:53,180
happens is oh google is down that's

1083
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:55,749
funny huh it's down all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for me</font>

1084
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,359
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wonder what that is but you know</font>

1085
00:43:55,749 --> 00:44:00,709
facebook yahoo being they all work so

1086
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:02,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably it's a google problem you know</font>

1087
00:44:00,709 --> 00:44:03,769
if it did<font color="#E5E5E5"> something wrong but i can't</font>

1088
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:06,589
call google because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know who</font>

1089
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:08,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">called and so whatever things we were</font>

1090
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:11,538
thinking about with other content

1091
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,900
providers is to declare on the quad a

1092
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:16,249
day in which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know major content</font>

1093
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,920
providers would get together and agree

1094
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:21,348
to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuates to the whole internet</font>

1095
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">for one day turn it on leave it on and</font>

1096
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:25,729
turn it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the goal of that would</font>

1097
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:27,829
be to get the user who has such a setup

1098
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:31,098
which is malfunctioning all around which

1099
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:32,430
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken to call their ISP and their</font>

1100
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:34,470
isp would know who they

1101
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:38,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">our and would say okay you have this</font>

1102
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:41,339
problem turn off v6 and you know that's

1103
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine they turn off v6 the zero point you</font>

1104
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,240
know zero five percent of users with

1105
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,640
this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> disable v6 fix the problem</font>

1106
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,140
and the rest of the internet you know

1107
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,660
the other ninety-nine point nine percent

1108
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,430
which doesn't have this problem can turn

1109
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,960
on v6 or leave it off it doesn't matter

1110
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,060
but it doesn't block other people who

1111
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,280
want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these six from using it so</font>

1112
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,220
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work hopefully will</font>

1113
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,230
you know black fixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the quad a will</font>

1114
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:06,390
help but you know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have other</font>

1115
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,070
ideas on how to find these people and

1116
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:09,810
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've found them how to report</font>

1117
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,130
them to their<font color="#E5E5E5"> SP because our privacy</font>

yours if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any ideas you know no</font>

1120
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:30,480
snow<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to switch</font>

1129
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just so I don't come off as the</font>

1130
00:45:53,520 --> 00:46:00,000
NAT guy of of I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

1131
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:02,100
quickly go over the fact that it since

1132
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,890
it says a panel for v6 adoption I mean

1133
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,790
in transition just to clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out</font>

1134
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,799
the fact that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing</font>

1135
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,630
transition as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II bursa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1136
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,700
job is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with the</font>

1137
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:15,600
engineering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> operations teams to</font>

1138
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:17,790
actually push native v6 out to the home

1139
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,819
user so and just give you a quick

1140
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">overview there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2009 we start rolling</font>

1141
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,270
on the backbone that's been completed

1142
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,450
we're now turning up every peering

1143
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:29,490
session we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year now pushing out</font>

1144
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:31,470
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems hope have every system</font>

1145
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,080
online by the end of the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1146
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:36,689
start a cable modem trials obviously

1147
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,990
we're a few years behind John so we've

1148
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:43,230
been playing catch-up ever since and I'm

1149
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:45,720
sure he'll hear some nice IM blow up

1150
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,070
next few months as we stumble across

1151
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,200
some of the challenges that he's already

1152
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">I run through all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so what we're</font>

1153
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,210
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is what so one of the</font>

1154
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,690
transition technologies already talked

1155
00:46:54,210 --> 00:47:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">about today was LSN service provider and</font>

1156
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:03,570
a score for theres also 6 rd both of

1157
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,090
these including other transition

1158
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:08,760
technologies clearly benefit from a

1159
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:11,760
shared address space so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1160
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,590
the ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> as asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a single block of</font>

1161
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,980
address space to be used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1162
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:19,619
purpose so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll do a quick history</font>

1163
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,440
lesson problem statement solution try to

1164
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,940
save some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for questions I'm sure</font>

1165
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:28,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">there'll be a lot of questions for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1166
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:31,740
whole session here<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so real quick</font>

1167
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:35,460
history lesson NCP to ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in</font>

1168
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:37,950
81 basically goal here was a flash cut

1169
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:40,140
which resulted in you know the internet

1170
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:43,589
well the network being<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken for for a</font>

1171
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:47,009
few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> flash for now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font>

1172
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:49,650
transition before to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 obviously we</font>

1173
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:51,560
can't turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the network for for a few</font>

1174
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:53,820
months that's not really practical so

1175
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,810
hence all the transition mechanisms

1176
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:58,800
we've been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all morning</font>

1177
00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so there were view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font>

1178
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">statement obviously I could be for</font>

1179
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,640
exhaustion is imminent

1180
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,980
you know it's arguable whether it's

1181
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,160
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen in q1 q2 q3 this is the</font>

1182
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:12,980
average of the of those the deployment

1183
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,230
is obviously ipv6 only deployment it's

1184
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,269
not really an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point v6</font>

1185
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:21,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">dual stack at least in my view point is</font>

1186
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:22,758
the only option<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and primarily the</font>

1187
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,920
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about this morning see</font>

1188
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:26,299
devices aren't aren't v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable today</font>

1189
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,680
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take us a few years to</font>

1190
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:33,140
get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the overall take away there</font>

1191
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,299
is providers must do something obviously

1192
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:38,720
we were very talked about today da6<font color="#E5E5E5"> rd</font>

1193
00:48:35,299 --> 00:48:39,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">EDS light large scale on that those are</font>

1194
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things we're going to be rolling out</font>

1195
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,730
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through the interim</font>

1196
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:46,220
point while we're doing v6 native as

1197
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,630
well and then the other problem that

1198
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,058
some of the large providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> were having</font>

1199
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:52,369
is we're running out of the 49 th and 19

1200
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:54,769
18 space or we have run out which makes

1201
00:48:52,369 --> 00:49:00,170
these transition technologies even more

1202
00:48:54,769 --> 00:49:02,868
of a challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy so Marla a</font>

1203
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:04,759
singer and Leo<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vigoda did a good draft I</font>

1204
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,920
believe a few ITF Segoe that's going

1205
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:09,049
through last call so hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if</font>

1206
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,970
we're if we need shade address space for

1207
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:13,519
multiple transition technologies and get

1208
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:16,180
us through the coexistence period what

1209
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:20,750
are the options available some of the

1210
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:22,009
240 /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 space the reserve space some of</font>

1211
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,099
the challenges there that we've already

1212
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:26,569
ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or some of the home gateways and</font>

1213
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:29,119
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we're talking about here</font>

1214
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is shared address space to be used in</font>

1215
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,799
the provider network not not out large

1216
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:35,930
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so it is going to look</font>

1217
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:37,940
like private address space internally to

1218
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:40,848
the service provider or large enterprise

1219
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,609
network some of the other options<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1220
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:45,349
redefine a user private space that

1221
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:48,549
hasn't allocated already so that's kind

1222
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:51,380
of what this this draft is seeking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1223
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:53,299
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> option is for operators to come</font>

1224
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,099
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say hey I got a piece of</font>

1225
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:57,019
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> space that I'll dedicate to this</font>

1226
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:58,130
cause and this operator has another

1227
00:49:57,019 --> 00:49:59,149
piece and we'll all get together and

1228
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,799
come up with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple hundred</font>

1229
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,750
maybe a thousand blocks that we can all

1230
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:05,180
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> internally to our networks and not</font>

1231
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,599
rat out obviously that has some

1232
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:10,220
operational considerations and is not

1233
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best case at least in our viewpoint</font>

1234
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:15,109
and the other option is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do nothing</font>

1235
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:17,230
in squat on space which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another</font>

1236
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:19,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">option that is being talked about in</font>

1237
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:21,840
and some in some networks so the

1238
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:24,450
recommended use is basically the least

1239
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,830
crappy of all these approaches is

1240
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,210
basically use to just go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take</font>

1241
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:30,279
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the address space that's out</font>

1242
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,290
there that isn't allocated today and

1243
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:35,590
dedicate it for coexistence transition

1244
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,940
technology usage benefits<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of</font>

1245
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:39,880
them are it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most predictable</font>

1246
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:42,280
outcome we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to run through a</font>

1247
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:46,330
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operational challenges we'd</font>

1248
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,380
have to with the others it our viewpoint

1249
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,240
it does offer the best customer

1250
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,440
experience because it's the least amount

1251
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,410
of development obviously they're still

1252
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,630
development needed but it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

1253
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:58,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through most</font>

1254
00:50:55,630 --> 00:51:01,660
efficiently and it does allow operators

1255
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:04,150
to focus on ipv6 deployment above all

1256
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,190
else because obviously we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1257
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:08,080
be staying here running before 10 years

1258
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:09,609
from now even though I'm sure it'll be

1259
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,150
little pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there somewhere</font>

1260
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:17,650
but obviously v6 is the way to go for

1261
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:20,500
for native internet usage<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1262
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:23,200
what is this real quick this is the

1263
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,910
definition is pulled from the draft it's

1264
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,439
basically reserved address space that

1265
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:28,359
could be used internally<font color="#E5E5E5"> to large</font>

1266
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,340
service providers or or large

1267
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:32,200
enterprises for the purpose of

1268
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,619
facilitating v6 transition or

1269
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,118
coexistence the recommended usage is it

1270
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:40,869
should not be you it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> only be used</font>

1271
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,820
between the CGN or LSN RSP net whatever

1272
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:46,450
you want to call it and then the CPE

1273
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:47,950
your router and that address space and

1274
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,660
it should not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used at home networks</font>

1275
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:51,790
because obviously that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would the whole</font>

1276
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:53,350
point of using shared address space is

1277
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:55,720
that you're not overlapping with an

1278
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:57,990
internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> private space within the home</font>

1279
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:03,730
networks some of the benefits

1280
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:05,290
flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's useful for both not</font>

1281
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,760
overlapping internally it's also useful

1282
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:09,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">for people that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of</font>

1283
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:13,600
artistry 1918 space as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well allow us a</font>

1284
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:16,299
transition and my overall view as it

1285
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:21,368
allows you to actually deploy native v4v

1286
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:23,260
64 until v6 catches up so loosen this

1287
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adjacent talking not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cox but</font>

1288
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,520
if you have native v6 before using

1289
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,250
darwin's theory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that</font>

1290
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,020
operating systems are skewed to actually

00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,090
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visa</font>

1292
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:36,240
over before at some point when all the

1293
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:38,430
content catches up and you'll see

1294
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,290
traffic rises to the point of critical

1295
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,700
threshold you're going to see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

1296
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,740
migration take place and then you can

1297
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,379
slowly phase out v4 from your from your

1298
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:49,740
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1299
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:52,280
security so having one block to apple

1300
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:55,109
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge is definitely beneficial</font>

1301
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,480
and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some supporters we've</font>

1302
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:59,640
had for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had some</font>

1303
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,770
interesting comments within actually

1304
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is the 02 version so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

1305
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:06,840
on on the third on the third version so

1306
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:10,640
we've incorporated a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the comments</font>

1307
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:13,230
we've already heard good feedback from

1308
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,270
operator community as well as vendors

1309
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:17,190
it's interesting most of the vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1310
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:19,500
against us but it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most</font>

1311
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:21,660
operators are for so I'm not sure what

1312
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,850
would hide read into that but it's kinda

1313
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,850
interesting and obviously time is of the

1314
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:28,529
essence if we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about q2 is</font>

1315
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:32,299
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna's gone obviously it doesn't</font>

so we have a we have five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes so</font>

does anyone have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions I've been</font>

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,950
with respect to content networks

1334

catching up I think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just actually</font>

1335
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:35,430
don't know where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we're kind of in</font>

1336
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,450
lockstep whether you know it or not

1337
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,859
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk more about that as</font>

1338
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:40,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> months progressive and I think</font>

1339
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:42,700
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see some thought leadership cup</font>

1340
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:45,549
from us um with respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to V</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6</font>

1341

transition second with the customer

perception that customers don't want it

1343
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:54,578
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it I think that so over</font>

1344
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:56,859
the past few weeks I building Cambridge

1345
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:58,630
anam go to Harvard Square a lot like it

1346
00:54:56,859 --> 00:55:00,038
around there and every now and then I'll

1347
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:03,609
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of walk up to someone to say</font>

1348
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:06,069
are you ready for ipv6 okay go what the

1349
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:09,308
hell are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font>

1350
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:11,469
think that from the cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and end-user</font>

1351
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:13,749
network perspective that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font>

1352
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:15,880
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> transparent to the users and from</font>

1353
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:17,200
the content perspective I think it's

1354
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,170
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be transparent to the users</font>

1355
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,180
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that unless we break it</font>

1356
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:24,789
you'll hear a lot from customers and end

1357
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:26,910
users so I'm not waiting around for

1358
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:30,609
customers to ask me for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will be ready</font>

1359
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:34,269
they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to use it the big big</font>

1360
00:55:30,609 --> 00:55:35,890
big thing with moving to<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 and this is</font>

1361
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:37,390
a personal opinion and I think it's

1362
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:40,269
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> an industry perspective as well</font>

1363
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:42,069
is that it has to be as good as v4 we

1364
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:43,808
cannot break the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet we cannot make</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">equal or better I'm hoping that it's</font>

00:55:46,029 --> 00:55:50,559
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be better um okay we only have</font>

or a big important part of the industry

1370
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:57,249
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing table you'll</font>

1371
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:59,348
