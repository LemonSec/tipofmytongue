00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:17,680
next we have a Tim come with Google on

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:25,289
enterprise q us<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh he is very updated</font>

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,289
air oh yeah oh you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use yeah</font>

5
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright my name is Tim Chang I represent</font>

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,340
the Google on corporate enterprise

7
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:18,720
architecture team so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

8
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,479
enterprise qos<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">agenda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show some challenges we had</font>

10
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,890
the solutions we came up with and some

11
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:32,130
best practices so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a note in</font>

12
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">case you didn't see the title</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

13
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,990
presentation so don't imply anything

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,970
about google com from this presentation

15
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:44,130
and after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root incident app I</font>

16
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,310
shall make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second note I'm Chinese but</font>

17
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,570
you know it's entirely yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I'm</font>

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:56,580
not uh don't associate I guess me with

19
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:59,309
any of the I root issues I was recently

20
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,560
at a security conference and the funny

21
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,020
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> was every conclusion of almost</font>

22
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,020
every prezzo was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese did it</font>

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:13,950
anyhow let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this brief I think the</font>

24
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:17,069
break is coming up soon so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

25
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,349
challenges so obviously the wine links

26
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">are bottleneck in terms of bandwidth</font>

27
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:26,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have limited when bandwidth</font>

28
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:30,569
to work with which makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> qos essential</font>

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,390
especially at these links obviously for

30
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,359
latency sensitive applications such as

31
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,190
real-time apps voice over IP or video

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,630
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very critical that you have the</font>

33
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">proper qos for this another thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

34
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,859
have many different apps that we

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,440
classify this becomes very challenging

36
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,150
in terms of actually having the

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,609
classification apple also another

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,200
challenge we have is we have different

39
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,470
agreements with different transit

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,379
providers as to how much traffic we can

41
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,040
naturally place in each different

42
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:09,859
classes of traffic or different queues

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,950
and obviously we operate a multi-vendor

44
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">network diverse hardware we're different</font>

45
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,070
q support for Q versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8q another thing</font>

46
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,340
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise is that we tend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

47
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:26,880
ipsec so Kos over IP 6 seems to be a

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:32,010
challenge performance is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important</font>

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,920
and obviously in terms of operations we

50
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,709
tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change our classification at</font>

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:43,109
least once a week<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two so definitely</font>

52
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:45,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is a challenge we have to solve so</font>

53
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,580
it's obvious that from the

54
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,100
classification<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint you want to do</font>

55
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,770
it closest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to edge as possible so this</font>

56
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,560
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best practices</font>

57
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">realistically this may not be possible</font>

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,530
right so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to trust or not</font>

59
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,140
to trust your end nodes it'll be nice to

60
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,610
trust the end nodes classification but

61
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,339
in reality is that you probably need to

62
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,070
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of construct some can</font>

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,680
Apple to classify traffic from your end

64
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,798
nodes especially when you have a very

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,870
creative<font color="#E5E5E5"> user base that have access have</font>

66
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,209
root access or administrative access to

67
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,400
your own box so presumably they can

68
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:28,440
classify all their flows as network

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:32,609
control so in terms of land switches

70
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:36,710
it's just some standard on cisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> akal to</font>

71
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:39,390
classify certain flows poor pays

72
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,960
classification by which I mean you just

73
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:47,310
classify on the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 ports it's</font>

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not ideal for many reasons but</font>

75
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,240
it may be sufficient for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

76
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,910
the answer here is as a trans out to

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,220
effect an most amount of good in the

78
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">short period of time we decided that we</font>

79
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:06,780
will classify at the wine edge router

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,150
and seven on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> land switches since</font>

81
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,239
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really where the congestion is</font>

82
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,000
happening right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

83
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:20,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that were we did was we pay very close</font>

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,380
attention to the classification<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple to</font>

85
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,230
make

86
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,230
sure is that granular as possible this

87
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:29,650
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to account for the fact that</font>

88
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lydia for classification is imperfect so</font>

89
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,280
just because something is port 80 does

90
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,860
not necessarily mean it's web traffic

91
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:41,979
right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an example of the</font>

92
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:46,270
level granularity we have we specify the

93
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,610
IP addresses as well as the port put

94
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:55,330
some cameras on them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> counter traffic</font>

95
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:58,380
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jean / commit scripts we use</font>

96
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:03,940
this extensively to handle various

97
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:06,610
issues via the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basic is very simple</font>

98
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,600
right you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different platforms on</font>

99
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:13,390
your network that use a ques vs. 4 q's

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:18,100
so you need some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> commit script</font>

101
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:21,400
to modify your classification<font color="#CCCCCC"> akal to</font>

102
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:25,420
tailor it to the specific platform this

103
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:31,599
is the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic but we also use the</font>

104
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">new scripts to modify the classifier to</font>

105
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,140
take care of cases where we have these

106
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:46,320
very specific routing instances on

107
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:49,599
certain subset of the routers and

108
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,540
another thing is this we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">police's and shapers right so this</font>

110
00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:00,190
becomes very problematic if you don't

111
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:03,160
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> commish grip so we do</font>

112
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:07,140
actually construct commit scripts that

113
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,000
actually takes input from interface tags

114
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,280
look at which platform is actually

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,470
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on and which when</font>

116
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,570
provider is actually the interface

117
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,990
connected to and based on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

118
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,420
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vega polices and</font>

119
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes we have shapers this is</font>

120
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessary for example if your physical</font>

121
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:31,530
drop is actually a giggi but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

122
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,530
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> purchase is actually just 50 legs</font>

123
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,359
right so at the end of the day on what

124
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,030
we end up doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right the</font>

125
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,360
business logic is actually encoded

126
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:47,000
inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chemist scripts and this is</font>

127
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a level abstraction it makes it</font>

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,530
easier for deployment engineers to

129
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,980
deploy qos and not really understand and

130
00:07:51,530 --> 00:08:00,500
deal with the complexity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

131
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:02,930
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> done by the conscripts so we like</font>

132
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said we have pleasers we definitely</font>

133
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">mark down certain traffic based on the</font>

134
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:15,169
business requirement for that particular

135
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:18,110
link some more syntax here what we

136
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:21,109
constructed in the firewall filter is

137
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,669
actually pre policer and post policer so

138
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,950
if you wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do some basic</font>

139
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,930
calculation to figure out how much

140
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:34,520
traffic was being marked down by a soft

141
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:39,200
policer this is some syntax on the

142
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,348
police<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER don't guess imply on these</font>

143
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,700
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that that these are</font>

144
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:50,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually actual so it's been modified so</font>

145
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,640
the operational aspects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kos this is</font>

146
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,469
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important we are network is fairly</font>

147
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,569
large so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effect changes</font>

148
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,290
relatively quickly and at the same time

149
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:06,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to have some</font>

150
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:09,380
statistical counters to look at we have

151
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:14,270
what we have changed this solution here

152
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:19,100
is not my creation but actually our

153
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:21,560
security team at Google we use they

154
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually built this a cogeneration</font>

155
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,680
program called Caprica so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a URL</font>

156
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,490
if you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

157
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,890
few slides I have borrowed from our

158
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,339
security team with their<font color="#CCCCCC"> permission</font>

159
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:40,100
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google matches its ackles</font>

160
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:42,840
from this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually open</font>

161
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,780
source recently under<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache team</font>

162
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,090
and pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the apples construct</font>

163
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">at Google uses this capital</font>

164
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:54,180
infrastructure so at a very very high

165
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,070
level essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have is you</font>

166
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,949
you have these<font color="#CCCCCC"> network definition files</font>

167
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,920
that essentially has IP addresses and

168
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have surfaced service definition</font>

169
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:10,829
files for example port 80 is ww is

170
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:13,980
actually port 8443 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL etc and what</font>

171
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,350
you do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create a policy file and</font>

172
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,300
then we doing generation you actually

173
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,710
have vendor specific code that actually

174
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:28,439
converts this metal language to a vendor

175
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:30,930
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> akal so this is a example of a</font>

176
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:36,630
network definition file as you can see

177
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:44,640
RFC 1918 is 10 / 8 and then 172 and 192

178
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:48,870
here so service definition file registry

179
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ford here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our example of how we</font>

180
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:57,840
construct a call for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2's classification</font>

181
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:01,790
here I'm classifying voice traffic and

182
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:09,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the meta policy language and</font>

183
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:13,380
this is the generated<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple next a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

184
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:16,820
or a qos over ipsec this actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font>

185
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,980
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently in the last few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months that</font>

186
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:23,550
which was very interesting we

187
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,220
essentially we have to use BGP to glue

188
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,800
most of our offices together even the

189
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,060
ones connected via ipsec so which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

190
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:37,410
we run PGP inside the ipsec tunnel and

191
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:40,170
for one reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> another the BGP was</font>

192
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,199
actually dropping as it turns out this

193
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,969
needs to be a junior feature where

194
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:49,080
despite the fact the routing engine

195
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:51,000
traffic or BGP is<font color="#E5E5E5"> president</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 it</font>

196
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,140
actually stuffs it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 which is</font>

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated with basically best effort</font>

198
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,119
this normally is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

199
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:04,499
until you have a service pick involved

200
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:09,149
where the host based traffic gets stuff

201
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:13,019
inside ipsec header and when it egress

202
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:15,769
out it has to goes out a real pic

203
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,149
interface that has a rewrite rule and

204
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:22,339
why is this a problem this is a problem

205
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:25,439
when the the inner<font color="#CCCCCC"> toss bite is copy out</font>

206
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:27,959
from the inside header to the outside

207
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:30,868
ipsec header but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> as soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

208
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:34,738
egress out of the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick back to</font>

209
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:37,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">to outgoing pick the rear I will</font>

210
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:40,290
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewrites it to effectively zero</font>

211
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,319
because as a source from the routing

212
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:47,488
engine the pack<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually associated</font>

213
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:51,988
with the forwarding class of basically

214
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:55,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">best effort there's a way to fix this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

215
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:59,910
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gina's tender or buff actually</font>

216
00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:07,110
allows you to classify hose base traffic

217
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:10,439
on the egress direction so some best

218
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,410
practices essentially you have to know

219
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:15,748
your applications how many types of

220
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:19,829
applications you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have what to classify</font>

221
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:22,589
in each class another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you have</font>

222
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:27,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your platforms and if you have</font>

223
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:29,249
dream<font color="#E5E5E5"> / robbers so don't expect to send</font>

224
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:33,749
10 gigs to traffic hitting the 100th

225
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:35,249
term with no 64 byte packets you'll

226
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:39,749
definitely not get the full pancake

227
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:41,939
throughput Cisco I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font>

228
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:44,429
are aware of tcam issues so just because

229
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:48,238
you construct a you can construct<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

230
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:51,509
policy language a file the don't expect

00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:57,389
degenerated<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco specific syntax to be</font>

232
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:59,239
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fit on the tee can write a last</font>

233
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,189
thing is pretty much test everything

234
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:04,079
this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important I always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

235
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:07,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">extra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic generator in the lab</font>

236
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,589
running bunch of tests so before you go

237
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,970
life make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

238
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,390
you tested everything and work out all

239
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,220
the issues and bugs and obviously

240
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,100
monitor everything we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> net flow</font>

241
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,020
running as well as well as counters from

242
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:27,920
the firewall counter that we actually

243
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:29,870
graph and in case you want to know it

244
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,069
will be more detailed on some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

245
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:40,640
mentioned here are some URLs and that's

246
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:44,650
pretty much it questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright nice</font>

247
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">and short thanks</font>
