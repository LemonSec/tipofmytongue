00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dave I have two stats so there were</font>

182
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,919
approximately 600<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages to the list</font>

183
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,620
since the last nanog and out of those

00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> communications committee moderated 6</font>

185
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,160
so it's a very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> number we try to</font>

186
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,130
keep our hands out of the pie as much as

187
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,220
possible there are three<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that had</font>

191
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,349
do those things the best place I would

192
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,760
think would be nanog futures which is

193
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,030
unmoderated so you can say anything you

194

<font color="#E5E5E5">I have done it after mine and Dave's to</font>

199
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,000

stuff you've heard so far if I don't see

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,539
anybody to Mike so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm guessing that</font>

202
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:49,030
means that there aren't any but I wanted

205
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,570
is is there a jabber room or some other

206
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,120
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for someone to raise questions via</font>

207
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,250
remote participation and the answer is

208
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,910
heck if I know so I figured I jump up to

209
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:10,960

jabber room but that's certainly

213
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:21,520
something that we would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about six years to find attendance of</font>

bubble if you remember back that far so

307
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,500
we're hoping that Nana becomes kind of a

another interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> stat that we've</font>

pretty close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a break even as you can</font>

320

327
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,790
in Miami which will be a fine place to

328
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,100
be in January in February although I had

329
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,620
to look this up in the the average high

330
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:59,459
temperature in miami in February is a

331
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,410
mere 77 degrees so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think oddly Miami</font>

332
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,219
will not be as pleasant a place to be as

333
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:08,130

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:41,550
there we go ok since we don't play

357

we do have somewhat limited time as

364

present<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything but instead of it</font>

366
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,679
once you try to do is give an overview

370
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,809
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start digging down into how</font>

371
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:23,890
things are really plan to work so you

372

important thing merits response<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

to do Merritt has the ultimate authority

their job<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to be responsive to the</font>

00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:30,279
the way it should be but the best have

00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:34,799
some implications for how<font color="#CCCCCC"> things work</font>

443

<font color="#CCCCCC">for us then I'll get evolution process</font>

444
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,519
started moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> toward self governance in</font>

445
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,979
2005 with the new charter<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the current</font>

446
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,389
charter operating under we've had a lot

447
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:47,200
of success since then we have a program

448
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:48,279
committee that is responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

449
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
conference content we have a

00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,489
communications committee formerly known

451
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,738
as the mailing list community committee

452
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:58,809
which manages the mailing list that

453
00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:01,720
performs its job of minimal moderation

454
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:03,879
while trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on track and</font>

455
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,950
we've created a marketing working group

456
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:08,918
which is doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful job of</font>

457
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,779
getting more sponsorship opportunities

458
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,940
for us

459
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:17,629
that means better brakes more beer more

460
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,629
gear and more more funds flowing in

461
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:24,139
still again and all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> August is</font>

462
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:27,419
an activity activity of merit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

463
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:32,849
ultimately it's their their money their

464
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:37,139
their risk their reward so you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

465
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:38,939
asking why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to change this we</font>

466
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:40,439
have a working governance model we've

467
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,089
demonstrated that clearly I think over

468
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,190
the last few years but we have a little

469
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:48,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit limited ability to act we've have</font>

470
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:53,279
been saying for the last three slides

471
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:56,460
merit distance activity they control the

472
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,629
money they control what happens again

473
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,570
that's nothing wrong with that that's

474
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:04,099
the way it is but we think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

475
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:06,178
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the ability</font>

476
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:10,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other question people have been</font>

477
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:12,359
asking is why we're doing this now well

478
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,999
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is that our kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of complex</font>

479
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:18,509
we started talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in January</font>

480
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:19,679
during the meeting in Austin and then we

481
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sat on it for a while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and tried to</font>

482
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out if we really still thought we</font>

483
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,429
we should do this we by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way is the</font>

484
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:27,719
steering<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee and bunch of people</font>

485
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked to another committee is</font>

486
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:32,759
in from the community so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

487
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:38,939
six of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a back room that's what 12</font>

488
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:40,769
to 15 of us in a side room I guess but

489
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,259
we've talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and got</font>

490
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:45,059
a lot of input and as we move forward

491
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:46,229
with this we want more more and more of

492
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we really don't want it to be</font>

493
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:50,519
driven solely by by the steering

494
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,668
committee it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be</font>

495
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:58,649
community effort anyways to continue

496
00:22:53,669 --> 00:23:01,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this the question as to why now we</font>

497
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:03,359
tried to time it so that work within

498
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:06,029
merits budget cycle which ends on june

499
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,559
thirtieth one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes people</font>

500
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:09,479
really upset is if you go to them with

501
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,099
new wonderful expansion or change plans

502
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:13,469
right after they've done their budgets

503
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,870
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we tried to do it</font>

504
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:18,059
beforehand

505
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:22,379
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be taken into</font>

506
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:25,830
account is that merit hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel</font>

507
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,300
contracts for ganas 50 and 51 as well as

508
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,129
the one we're at now in the previous

509
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,970
ones so that's two of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the few meetings</font>

510
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,320
in the next fiscal year that controls in

511
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,460
large part the timing of when<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

512
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,309
transition can happen so the green text

513
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,700
at the bottom we believe it's time for

514
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:47,928
Nana to become autonomous as somebody

515
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,179
put it it's like a kid growing up and

516
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:52,800
going out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world on their own I</font>

517
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,850
had a daughter just Gregor graduate from

518
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,309
high school the other day so I we go

519
00:23:53,850 --> 00:24:00,030
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like in great site good good</font>

520
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:01,710
sense so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create an</font>

521
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,410
independent legal entity with

522
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,030
independent funding sources our own

523
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,000
financial management<font color="#E5E5E5"> has control and</font>

524
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,490
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important at the bottom is a</font>

525
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,550
membership owns the organization and

526
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,890
controls what happens that's the theme

527
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:20,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've heard earlier but in this</font>

528
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:22,679
case it's our members whose goals are

529
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:27,929
this are the mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we gave at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

530
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:30,330
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here we go here's a brief</font>

531
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:34,760
flowchart of things are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

532
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:37,889
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they're going to happen today</font>

533
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,790
legal status now I was an activity of

534
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:43,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Merit network we plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move it to an</font>

535
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:46,620
activity of a new corporation called<font color="#CCCCCC"> nu</font>

536
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:51,389
nog inc which will become<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 501c3</font>

537
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,889
nonprofit which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a we don't</font>

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay income</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tax mb we can accept</font>

539
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:59,070

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:03,570
a board of<font color="#CCCCCC"> directors of this new</font>

541
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:05,220
corporation funding right now it's

542
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,379
activity-based which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

543
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,679
in for conferences and goes out to pay

544
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,470
for the conferences and other things we

545
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,380
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve build upon the</font>

546
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:19,950
sponsorship model and possible to move

547
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:22,740
it beyond a<font color="#E5E5E5"> per meeting type of thing we</font>

548
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,600
think we can get revenue from

549
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,250
memberships we think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

550
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,250
corporate sponsorships that are not

necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> tied to specific</font>

552

parts of meetings like a break or a

<font color="#CCCCCC">viewing gear there's grant money out</font>

554
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,330
there there there are definite ways to

00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,140
raise money<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are lot of</font>

556
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good ideas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think marketing</font>

557
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,380
folks will tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there have been</font>

558
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,740
people who have offered<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like this</font>

559
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,030
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past and we want to provide a way</font>

560
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,770
for people who want to give us money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

561
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:58,139
do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'll just add it's not in here</font>

562
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:01,790
but what that means for us is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

563
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,600
have with increased revenue from non

564
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,100
registration fees that means that we

565
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,040
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep registration fees at a</font>

566
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,790
reasonable level as perhaps the cost of

567
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:15,420
hotels goes up and the cost of cookies

568
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:18,840
goes up and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

569
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:22,050
financial reporting again with us have

570
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,990
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisory role what we see of the</font>

00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:30,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">finance is is same reports that you see</font>

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:33,020
here every three months four months my

573
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:36,929
understanding is that nana is not a

574
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:39,870
separate bank account or pseudo bank

575
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:42,750
account within merit but it's funded

576
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:49,260
like any other project and budget in

577
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:53,070
that way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on as by taking it into</font>

578
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,660
ourselves that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we will see</font>

579
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,669
everything and will be financially

580
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:01,530
accountable to to our membership which

581
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:03,270
we hope to be you guys staffing right

582
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,120
now all the hard work here is done by

583
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:08,879
the merit staff and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reiterate</font>

584
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,840
that I I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Garrett has done a really</font>

585
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:16,110
good job with all of this and the water

586
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,389
plans are no way reflection on the

587
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,850
people who make all this stuff here in

588
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,190
the meeting happen for for us again

589
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:28,889
without you<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would be in a bare room</font>

590
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:31,910
with no AV and no nothing no cookies so

591
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:35,330
we intend as it as a new organization to

592
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,040
have a limited paid staff

593
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,320
probably an executive director or

594
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,879
something like that maybe if we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

595
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,460
one or two other people to handle stuff

596
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,240
but to contract<font color="#CCCCCC"> out most of it really</font>

597
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need a full-time event staff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 243</font>

598
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:54,920

00:27:52,490 --> 00:28:00,680
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that so there's potential for</font>

600
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:03,440
efficiencies there we believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

601
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">right more slides so mission statement</font>

604
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,900
organizing conferences and have a

605
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,510
mailing list the goal is still to

606
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,770
provide forms for the education and

607
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharing of knowledge in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the North</font>

609
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,690
we have will have flexibility to do more

610
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">than that we can expand our education</font>

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and outreach programs we could find ways</font>

612
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:32,360
of expanding online forums like maybe

613
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:33,800

publications or certifications or things

617
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:48,530
like that these are things that moving

more towards they don't stay

professional organization because that

620
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,830
actually needs something an IRS speak

621
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,830
but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> but more of a group of</font>

toward education educating people that

624
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:08,780
we can accomplish if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> devote to that the governance so</font>

626
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:16,460
we've created a done profit corporation

627
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:19,960
do not Inc the name by the way is isn't

628
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,520
is a name it was intended by the way to

629
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,950
emphasize the transitional nature of it

630
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,510
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of us expects in three</font>

631
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:31,460
or four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will still be calling</font>

00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,030
up calling ourselves nanog if we can

634
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,590
work out the transfer of the

635
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,899
intellectual property assets that are

636
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:43,010
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that if not we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

637
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else but whatever we have a</font>

638
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:48,210
board<font color="#CCCCCC"> of directors which today is the</font>

00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,678
six elected steering committee members

640
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,740
as we grow we're going to mirror the

641
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,950
existing other committees so that people

642
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,720
doing work for merit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nanog meeting i</font>

643
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,710
will be the same people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the work</font>

644
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,850
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new dog sponsored meeting or not</font>

645
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,440
hosted whatever meeting we want to build

646
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,020
a membership-based by decoupling it from

647
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,730
conference attendance there's been

648
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:16,020
assumed about that on then I features

649
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,400
the last few days one thing I once

650
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,870
emphasize is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anybody has</font>

651
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,790
serious take part of the concept of

652
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:25,239
requiring a paid membership to be on the

653
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:31,840
mailing list so that's not going to

654
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:32,710
happen we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> intend to we don't think</font>

655
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,000
it would be appropriate either to

656
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,580
require membership to be here in these

657
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings one thing that may happen is</font>

658
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,610
that if you become remember you may get

659
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,260
a little registration discount which

660
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,309
might have offset the cost of membership

661
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,230
but you know those are things to be

662
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:49,000
worked out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> funding by you want more</font>

663
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,040
funding from membership and sponsor

664
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,190
organizations and other contributors so

665
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:58,918
that we're not relying solely on meeting

666
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,919
registration revenues to fund everything

667
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,799
here's more about the membership should

668
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,610
wear the slides before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started talking</font>

669
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them something today I need to</font>

670
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,899
mention here also is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

671
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:14,320
are it says proposal to the top and it's

672
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:17,110
because is what they are we on the board

673
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,220
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisors we've been talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

674
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,428
people from a community have throwing

675
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,860
out ideas which are going to seed some

676
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:27,100
discussions but we're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

677
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:31,360
committees which will actually come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

678
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,918
with real concrete proposals for what

679
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,750
violation of the club membership should

680
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,770
work some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> must look it to</font>

681
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:40,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit those committees are going</font>

682
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,809
to be chaired by people not on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

683
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">artist and committee and I very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

684
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,530
hope that the majority of the people on

685
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">these committees will not be us we</font>

686
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want this organization to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be what</font>

687
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,408
you guys want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and to continue gun at rudder we</font>

689
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:59,519
think that model worked out quite well

during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition back in 2005 and</font>

691
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:06,299
we want to see it happen again so that's

692
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:09,508
that our ideas for how things ought to

693

work there's a current<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana voting</font>

the beginning of 2009 I guess we'll be

able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote in that election we intend</font>

question of when we get to vote on this

718
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,320
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer that said that</font>

719
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,059
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want you to not say</font>

720
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,689
anything now if you have opinions or

721
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:24,269
concerns or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's this is the</font>

722
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:28,889
time to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> them up during these next</font>

723
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:31,470
couple of days and beyond let's see what

724
00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:35,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">else we have here Oh some other ideas</font>

725
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:38,279
I've been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about oh one of the</font>

726
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:40,590
big ideas big reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for wanting a</font>

727
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:43,529
membership is that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

728
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">would like to be eligible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote who</font>

729
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:47,190

730
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,899
meeting they participate in the mailing

731
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,190
lists they deal with their Nana of stuff

732
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:54,809
but they can't physically make it here

733
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:56,220
we want to enable them to that being a

734
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:57,789
member will probably involve paying some

735
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,470
dues

736
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:02,200
we have run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of all sorts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of numbers</font>

738
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:09,790
looking like don't be very high<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

739
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:12,098
it'll be nonzero probably we started

740
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:14,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about the idea of discounted</font>

751
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:42,129
maybe other future benefits and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

754
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:55,149
conferences enlist we've been discussing

755
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,510
ways that we can change the way we fund

756
00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:04,618
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this more money from</font>

757
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:07,150
sponsors and possibly from hosts we

758
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:14,950
think perhaps we can save<font color="#CCCCCC"> some money and</font>

759
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:17,520
hotel costs if we use a professionals

760
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:21,368
who do that sort of thing for a living

761
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:27,099
we want to outsource the adult stuff

762
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:29,470
like registration management and on-site

763
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:32,460
logistics things like running the

764
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:35,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and a wireless and all that</font>

765
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,700
again is no reason to hire paid staff to

766
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,890
do it when you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in two or</font>

767
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,629
three meetings a year and so we

768
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:44,828
contracted out to people who are

769
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:48,480
professionals mailing list same thing

770
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:52,000
contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the hosting of it</font>

771
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:56,920
but keep community management much as it

772
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">is now contracted outsourced with form</font>

773
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,570
its obligations that basically means

774
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:03,060
that we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up the</font>

775
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,200
mailing list server in my garage and

776
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,900
depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my goodwill to keep it writing</font>

777
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,259
we want somebody whose job it is to do

778
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:13,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and if they want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money to do it</font>

779
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,760
we'll pay them if they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> donate</font>

780
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:18,880
the resources that's fine too happily

781
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">take donations but we got it done</font>

782
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,620
professionally right now it's done

783
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:29,500
professionally we don't want to change

784
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:30,910
that here's a timeline this is a

785
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">question that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people have been</font>

786
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:38,740
asking we finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some answers so</font>

787
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,630
right now you can see the it's orange

788
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and black now a change color since I saw</font>

789
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:47,320
this last so the orange bar is mirrored

790
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,509
operating the meetings the black bar is

791
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,670
do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bright in the meetings you</font>

792
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,380
can see the gap between 951 which is the

793
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,630
meeting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miami and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> january-february</font>

794
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,850
and then I'm 52<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the meeting in</font>

795
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:04,540
denver in june i believe it is up next

796
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:06,069
year so and then you see ah ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

797
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,480
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt's running the meetings merit</font>

798
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,000
because you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run the meetings as</font>

799
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,850
they have been for those that they have

800
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,840
hotel contracts for that's obviously the

801
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,750
right thing to do they have the

802
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:20,590
liability they need to control their

803
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:23,770
revenue stream and all that there's a

804
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:26,470
red line in<font color="#CCCCCC"> October which is when we're</font>

805
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,420
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the election to try to</font>

806
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:33,060
ratify all of this and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

807
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:35,350
happen starting with nano 52 in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Denver</font>

808
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,730
the new organization will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

809
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:42,509
meetings we've been talking with merit

810
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:45,220
about the possibility of having them

811
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,900
provide the meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> surface as much as</font>

812
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,089
they do now for that meeting as well so

813
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I use the transition</font>

814
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:57,320
we expect that that will work out and

815
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:59,210
over that route now in 53 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beyond is</font>

816
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,450
when we start having the opportunity to

817
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:03,530
explore new<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways of doing things</font>

818
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:07,868
possibly working with other vendors to

819
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:11,050
do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll see how that goes</font>

820
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:15,260
Meredith certainly if they're interested

821
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:18,260
is possible to I submitter for that as

822
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:22,070
well will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be their choices to whether</font>

00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're interested or not and but it'll</font>

824
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:27,080
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a competitive bidding type of</font>

of this we want to thank Aaron for going

835
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:51,290
out on a limb doing that for us we don't

<font color="#E5E5E5">believe in sweats of the lemon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

it which we believe are fairly realistic

891
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,339
their job will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to take those numbers</font>

892
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:19,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we find them even further and dig</font>

committee not just an individual these

901
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,760
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who figure out</font>

902

things like how hotels are going to work

be to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any of us any of the</font>

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,910
an opportunity to come up and say a few

hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to just want to</font>

934
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:11,308
say a few words many of you saw my

935
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:14,250
posting on nanog future but essentially

936
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:17,069
the way this happened we at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt</font>

937
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:20,609
thought that that we were in a position

938
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:22,740
where if we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight this</font>

939
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:25,259
transition obviously we thought this was

940
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the wrong thing we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard if</font>

941
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,040
we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was the right thing we</font>

942
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,380
would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done it before before we</font>

943
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we could run nanog very well but</font>

944
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,640
if we wanted to fight<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

945
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:39,329
to debate with the volunteers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make</font>

946
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,670
nanog happen and as you know nanog is a

947
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:43,770
volunteer-driven organization it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

948
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:46,650
makes nanog your great organization an

949
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:49,079
open debate wouldn't serve the community

950
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,809
at all so we've decided to help its

951
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:55,589
transition we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to debate with</font>

952
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:57,720
any any of the current members of the

953
00:43:55,589 --> 00:44:01,589
community and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support</font>

954
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this the the best that we can that's all</font>

955
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:03,980
thanks

956
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,700
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ina we appreciate that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

957
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,109
you use the word differences among

958
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,089
friends when we were meeting the other

959
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:18,480
day and that's really what what this is

960
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:20,560
looking like we obviously disagree on

961
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,050
whether this is the right move<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we</font>

962
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,020
agree that moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward in a</font>

963
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:29,460
professional and friendly manner is much

964
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:31,839
better than fragmenting things so uh

965
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:35,950
Patrick you had some questions from<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRC</font>

966
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,960
I'd like to get him hello there so the

967
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,879
questions started with will term limits

968
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,210
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Merit nog carry over to nu nog and</font>

969
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,859
the SC has agreed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> abide by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the term</font>

970
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,720

971
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:47,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">term-limited right now and he will not</font>

972
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to stand for re-election</font>

973
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,240
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has promised to help out any</font>

974
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,500
way which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really nice of him the</font>

975
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,180
second question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how does merit feel</font>

976
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:58,030
about this I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

977
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,649
that there are some letters<font color="#E5E5E5"> on noon org</font>

978
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:01,750
from Merritt that you can read or you

979
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:04,359
can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask Don or some of</font>

980
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:06,190
the other mayor of people how about the

981
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:08,710
IP space is that isn't it a reserved

982
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:11,560
block that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also covered in the</font>

983
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,510
letters that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are on the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Norg website</font>

984
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,040
merit plans to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the IP space we're</font>

985
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,740
looking into<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a micro allocation</font>

986
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,730
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and somebody</font>

987
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,009
asked whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're only 10 minutes</font>

988
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:23,530
allocated we didn't actually allocate

989
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:25,030
anything so first of all we just decided

990
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:28,450
to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time at the community</font>

991
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:30,550
meeting which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now there is a bawth</font>

992
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:33,129
tomorrow which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be more fully</font>

993
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:35,530
encompass and discussing all those stuff

994
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,210
90 minutes and also when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was walking</font>

995
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I noticed that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sign outside said</font>

997
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:43,720
schedule says it goes to 6 45 so we can

998
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:45,849
keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess if you guys don't</font>

needles in my eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> if goes on too long</font>

1001
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,130
and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions from IRC if</font>

you have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> more you can either put</font>

1006
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:11,380
um thank you very much for sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

this information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I shared on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the mailing list that this was one of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that was discussed and even</font>

1010
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,650
the very first steering committee

1011
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:23,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting the idea that a steering</font>

1016
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:36,610
guess I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting some mixed signals and</font>

1017
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:38,859
I'm hoping you could clear up with a

1018
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:44,650
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these questions the first is</font>

1019
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:46,450
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a done deal um I wouldn't say</font>

1020
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:51,880
it's a done deal i'd say we're well down

1021
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:54,609
the path certainly if there is a reason

1022
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so including possibly huge outcry</font>

1023
00:46:54,610 --> 00:47:00,990
from you guys I imagine it's still

1024
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:04,720
possible to change directions certainly

1025
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:05,979
it would be possible to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1026
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people is in charge and you</font>

1029
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">those out I certainly wouldn't want to</font>

1030
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,940
stick around if people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

1031
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the job and I think the others</font>

1032
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:21,250
will kill same way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tell you up until</font>

1033
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,710
the election in October that there's

1034
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:26,500
still opportunity that side we have

1035
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:27,910
started moving in a path there are

1036
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,100
contractual things that would need to be

1037
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:32,649
resolved if we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn around and</font>

1038
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">go back I wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say it's instrumental</font>

1039
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:37,570
though I guess the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1040
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,390
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really do need to see some</font>

1041
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:41,710
financials there's enough overhead and

1042
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:44,470
what you're describing as the

1043
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:47,580
replacement for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status quo that one</font>

1044
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:50,470
could see the cost getting very quickly

1045
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:51,880
pretty high<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes I know you might be</font>

1046
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to save some money on some hotel</font>

1047
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,360
stuff and you can do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweaks here</font>

1048
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,549
and there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjust the the cost</font>

1049
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,110
structures but at this point it sounds

1050
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,150
like you're saying it's more or less a

1051
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,250
done deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we really don't know what</font>

1052
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:05,740
this new overarching structure is so i

1053
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,270
encourage you to include the community

1054
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much information as you can about</font>

1055
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:14,259
the budget requirements for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new</font>

1056
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,820
body we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sharing the pro forma</font>

1057
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,080
budget during the meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> tomorrow the</font>

1058
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,710
main reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't want to do it</font>

1059
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,720
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font>

1060
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:23,050
as we were told<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to be out</font>

1061
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,399
of here six minutes from now that

1062
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,130
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out to not be the case</font>

1063
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,839
but that said we haven't prepared in

1064
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:32,020
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide deck fit the stuff that we</font>

1065
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:33,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over that if you guys want to</font>

1066
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,790
stick around for another hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose</font>

1067
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:41,320
we could but also it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on who the</font>

1068
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:42,430
people up here can sit that long<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1069
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all have to say on that we do we do</font>

1070
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:54,220
have numbers we do and had to share them

1071
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:56,109
with you yeah all right if Dan's going

1072
00:48:54,220 --> 00:49:02,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer I think bills question i'll</font>

1073
00:48:56,109 --> 00:49:05,859
let him go first just to the common ion

1074
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:07,689
bills question in terms of the money

1075
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:09,220
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being spent there's I think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1076
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,869
of politics going on here and I think

1077
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,509
the steering committee members are being

1078
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:15,070
very cautious of how the interact with

1079
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">mayor and I think the Americas are being</font>

1080
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,490
very cautious and it's good because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1081
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,720
know through this transition I think

1082
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:22,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have to be a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> delicate</font>

1083
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,859
and how they go about things but in

1084
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of the budget and in terms of the</font>

1085
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:30,040
expenditures you know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

1086
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:32,770
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do not have a tremendous amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1087
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,720
intelligence on how merit exactly spent

1088
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,480
every penny looking at it and comparing

1089
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,520
it in a pro forma way to other similar

1090
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,560
conferences and how much conference

1091
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,869
management services cost how much the

1092
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,950
overhead should be at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> in time</font>

1093
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:47,320
there isn't a lot of additional

1094
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,910
efficiencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> mayor can squeeze out if</font>

1095
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,650
you compared to maybe two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

1096
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,598
ago there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were some really big in</font>

1097
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,460
efficiencies but<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the past two or</font>

1098
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,380
three years I think Betty in particular

1099
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,420
squeezed a lot of inefficiencies out

1100
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:02,500
that being said in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of what it</font>

1101
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:04,480
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost us to actually run you know</font>

1102
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,460
these conferences I think that's where

1103
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could in terms of the staffing and</font>

1104
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,119
the overhead rather than the conference

1105
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,290
services we could certainly save some

1106
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:13,510
money there we're not going to get into

1107
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:15,070
a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's like oh my god</font>

1108
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,740
you know it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost us much more</font>

1109
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,540
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this than it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs merritt merritt</font>

1110
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:22,359
did not have particular efficiencies in

1111
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,369
this way in fact by going to the

1112
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:26,049
approach Steve talked about and going

1113
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:29,410
for professional conference management

1114
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:30,200
services we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can probably squeeze out</font>

1115
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:32,180
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition</font>

1116
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,310
efficiencies on the overhead side the

1117
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">merit simply couldn't because you know</font>

1118
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:39,740
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 or 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 other</font>

1119
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:40,730
conferences so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think as we move</font>

1120
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,279
forward I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this is kind of a</font>

1121
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,930
convoluted answer but the the chance

1122
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,270
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to stop in six</font>

1123
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,129
months and say wow<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mayor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was doing this</font>

1124
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:51,950
much cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we are that's</font>

1125
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,869
extremely unlikely compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

1126
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:56,270
know of our comparison between this and

1127
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:58,550
other conferences but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not basing</font>

1128
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:00,770
any forward-looking decisions on our

1129
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:07,490
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get additional funding beyond</font>

1130
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:10,670
which merit got so I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1131
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:12,799
emails that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were up on the website that</font>

1132
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:15,500
you guys wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty thousand dollars</font>

1133
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,630
to transfer the name nanog and the and

1134
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain and I'm wondering where that</font>

1135
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,109
number comes from why you think the

1136
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:23,689
nanog name is worth thirty thousand

1137
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:25,220
dollars and if it might make more sense

1138
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,349
for us to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a different name</font>

1139
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:29,868
rather than pay that or where that

1140
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">number is coming from she's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1141
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:34,339
theory just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the the domain we</font>

1142
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,390
kind of appraised<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain a little</font>

1143
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:47,750
bit and it kind of came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to about</font>

1144
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:49,690
three hundred forty dollars Sudan so the

1145
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">way nonprofits get in the most trouble</font>

1146
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:55,040
is called as conflicts of interest so we

1147
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,770
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the University of Michigan</font>

1148
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:01,940
office of technology transfer and they

1149
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:03,619
said the domain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trademark name</font>

1150
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:08,780
are worth between<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty and fifty</font>

1151
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:11,800
thousand dollars and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we gave the</font>

1152
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:14,119
name in the domain to the nu nu nog

1153
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,099
somebody who attended a meeting at some

1154
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,140
point somebody who was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steering</font>

1155
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:21,079
committee five years ago could raise a

1156
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:23,029
stink and say you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gave it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1157
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:26,089
them you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have given it to me so</font>

1158
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:28,520
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a hard documentation in an</font>

1159
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:31,339
exchange at market value for something

1160
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,460
of value then both organizations are

1161
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:36,650
protected now yeah we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a price tag of</font>

1162
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:39,230
thirty thousand dollars as we as we said

1163
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,700
with Steve and Sylvie well you know we

1164
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,500
could say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start paying that</font>

1165
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:45,660
once your reserve gets to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100,000 or two</font>

1166
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,510
thousand or you could pay thousand

1167
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,879
dollars a year or something like that

1168
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:53,820
but but the idea that there is a an

1169
00:52:50,880 --> 00:53:00,810
exchange of something of value that's

1170
00:52:53,820 --> 00:53:03,420
documented and protects us both Randy

1173
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:15,500
I care um the gentleman who got Nobel

1174
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:20,339
Prize for economics it would be good if

1175
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:23,520
banking became boring again this should

00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:57,580
this we do not in that moment intend to

1202

take sides or say that this should be

1203

done or shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done but it looked</font>

1204
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:05,230
like it was happening and we were happy

1205
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:07,779
to help etc we are now carrying that

1206
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:10,300
contract as a liability on our books and

1207
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:13,330
we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> counting on somebody to</font>

and thank you Paul and in there and for

1217

government governance and voting process

1219
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:51,970
in nanog is you know we only get one

1220
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:55,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">shot at this once a year which is we</font>

1221
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:58,899
vote at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fall Meeting so you know we</font>

1222
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:01,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">need the constructs which are the rule</font>

1223
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,700
changes to be you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of us</font>

1224
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,310
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and then so that we actually</font>

1225
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:09,580
can vote on a new charter and move on

1226
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:13,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the other observation I would make</font>

1227
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:15,640
is as since we're booking hotels and

1228
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:18,490
things with long-term future liabilities

1229
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:22,150
I mean that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really what this is about</font>

1230
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:26,319
in terms of the organizational construct

1231
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:28,540
that's created and so we will actually

1232
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,640
rather quickly arrive at the point of no

1233
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:34,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">return on this because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we will book a</font>

1234
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:37,150
hotel for some time in what the end of

1235
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:38,720
2011<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the beginning of 2012 and that</font>

1236
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:43,040
will be

1237
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:45,290
you know on somebody's books actually

1238
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hotel sub hotel has already been</font>

1239
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:53,630
booked by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this organization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for june of</font>

1241
00:56:53,630 --> 00:57:00,020
to we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and hold a</font>

1243
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,349

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I don't want to see that</font>

00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:06,680
but that's at least one set of questions

00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:09,080
that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing this go on over</font>

00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,680
from now when kind of its supposedly

00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,109
to clarify the role<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Todd and I have</font>

questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about liabilities these</font>

1286
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:41,029
liabilities always existed so someone

1287
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,609
was always assuming these liabilities in

1288
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:45,830
the past it was merit and because merit

1289
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:47,359
was was assuming these liabilities it

1290
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,650
let them do stuff like decide when to

1291
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,538
schedule

1292
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,579
conferences to decide how many

1293
00:58:50,539 --> 00:58:53,720
conferences to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year to decide how</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">long they are to decide how they're</font>

1295
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:59,089
scheduled to to pick one host over

1296
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,250
another host to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things that</font>

1297
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:03,440
that the SC was sort of originally

designed to start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over the</font>

1302
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:12,589
huge contract liability so it's unfair

1303
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:15,500
for you guys to exert any kind of

1304
00:59:12,589 --> 00:59:17,150
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over this so you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1307
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:24,680
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because someone else is assuming</font>

1308
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,419
these liabilities which is the new nanog

00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:31,609
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a different guy with the same</font>

1311
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:33,799
liability now the SC can start making

<font color="#E5E5E5">these decisions for us and we elect them</font>

consistently bumping up against the

friction which is the reality that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

know it's not been talked about

enormously in public but now has been

1372
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:43,000

pushed them hard to plan more nanog

01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,629
further into the future so that we could

1378
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:54,070
all plan our meeting attendance and we

1379

could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better hosts and we could get</font>

the cities we wanted and conferences we

wanted in dates we wanted but then on

divergence of time of the perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:54,549
don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we had tried to do</font>

1407
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:56,200
this during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition back in 2005</font>

1408
01:02:54,550 --> 01:03:01,200
was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been much</font>

1409
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:01,200
harder sure

1410
01:03:07,569 --> 01:03:10,719
you guys have in the answers have talked

1411
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,538
a lot about what's happened in the past

1412
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:15,099
in terms of the management<font color="#CCCCCC"> of nanog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1413
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,719
them and the meetings themselves I'm

1414
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:18,339
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

1415
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,369
changes that you guys are looking to do

1416
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:23,739
in the new nog that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1417
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:26,589
that make all this work worth it what's

1418
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:28,779
the payoff besides you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1419
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:30,578
freedom to do exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want how</font>

1420
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:33,190
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it I think that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> payoff</font>

1421
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:35,949
in and of itself it does give us down

1422
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:38,890
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> with flexibility to experiment</font>

1423
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:40,150
with new sponsorship models some people

1424
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:42,489
have proposed changing number of

1425
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:44,519
meetings in a year it gives us the

1426
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:49,410
opportunity to expand it to areas that

1427
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:53,649
were not currently in like the document

1428
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:55,989
tracks are that sort of thing I believe

1429
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:59,109
that's that's the flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> short term</font>

1430
01:03:55,989 --> 01:04:00,519
the goal is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not break things and at</font>

1431
01:03:59,109 --> 01:04:01,719
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to be flippant</font>

1432
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:05,078
about that that is a very important

1433
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:06,640
thing if we create the opportunity to

1434
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:08,259
build all this new stuff while just

1435
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,078
toying what's here now we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1436
01:04:08,259 --> 01:04:13,569
our jobs so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to focus a lot on my</font>

1437
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:15,009
breaking things that's a big piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1438
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:16,089
what needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done in that's probably</font>

1439
01:04:15,009 --> 01:04:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">well going to be focusing most of our</font>

1440
01:04:16,089 --> 01:04:24,430
energy on for the next year so many know

1441
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:26,589
so Vijay kill so by<font color="#CCCCCC"> I grieve it Randy</font>

1442
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:28,359
that basically we trust you guys we are

1443
01:04:26,589 --> 01:04:30,549
your elected members please go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1444
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:32,828
execute as you see fit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't</font>

1445
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:35,229
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we vote you out and we shouldn't</font>

1446
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:37,719
debate this much in and take up more

1447
01:04:35,229 --> 01:04:39,729
operational time debating this what I

1448
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:42,279
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I think would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make life much</font>

1449
01:04:39,729 --> 01:04:44,618
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me and from I'm zoom for</font>

1450
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:45,670
other people is whenever I go up and say

1451
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,900
I need a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hundred million</font>

1452
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:48,729
dollars because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this or</font>

1453
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:51,459
that they say he what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your base</font>

1454
01:04:48,729 --> 01:04:53,379
structural assumptions that you ask are

1455
01:04:51,459 --> 01:04:56,109
asking for that say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

1456
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:58,390
actually worth spending and then what

1457
01:04:56,109 --> 01:05:00,819
they ask for is perturb the base

1458
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:02,769
assumptions so its sensitivity analysis

1459
01:05:00,819 --> 01:05:05,589
like what if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attendance goes to 300</font>

1460
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:07,988
how long can you log continue to operate

1461
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:10,599
what if the tendons it works really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1462
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:12,940
the tendons goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000 what what are</font>

1463
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:14,319
the future plans for the kind of money

1464
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,999
that comes in at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time if you do</font>

1465
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:18,069
that kind of sensitivity analysis on and

1466
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:18,439
post it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we are pretty much good</font>

1467
01:05:18,069 --> 01:05:19,730
to go

1468
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:25,099
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should stop discussing</font>

1469
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:35,300
this anymore many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to touch</font>

1470
01:05:25,099 --> 01:05:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything okay Randy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> busia AJ I was on</font>

1471
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:43,250
the first steering committee um this has

1472
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:45,950
been happening for a long time the

1473
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:52,550
question I would ask is why it wasn't

1474
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:56,089
done soon to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an idea of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1475
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:59,740
daniel said it the real basis is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt</font>

1476
01:05:56,089 --> 01:06:02,839
has their goals they are good goals

1477
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:04,970
admirable merit does a good job for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1478
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:08,810
state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan educational world etc</font>

1479
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:13,180
etc those aren't the goals of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana</font>

1480
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:17,060
community they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in conflict</font>

1481
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:20,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I would you know when I went to</font>

1482
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:24,200
boiling point was when an analog meeting

1483
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:28,130
was scheduled in direct conflict with an

1484
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">r ir and other regional nod meeting that</font>

1485
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:33,369
half the steering committee had to go to

1486
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:38,150
and it was scheduled that way to avoid a

1487
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:40,910
merit internal meeting our external

1488
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:43,369
meeting with their memberships and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

1489
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:45,910
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why merit did that but there</font>

1490
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:49,190
was no ability to discuss and negotiate

1491
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:51,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but to take the second half of you</font>

1492
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:55,010
and that's no blame on merit and no

1493
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:58,940
blame on nanog that's what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

1494
01:06:55,010 --> 01:07:00,829
you know the goals are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different the</font>

1495
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:04,760
second part of your question I think is

1496
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:07,520
worthwhile though what will change I

1497
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:09,890
think of course the people up there are

1498
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,410
very worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about breaking things but</font>

1499
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:15,020
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that really should be</font>

1500
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:17,299
changing and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on and one of</font>

1501
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:21,050
them kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pokes the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Vijay's question</font>

1502
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:24,319
about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know um sensitivity analysis</font>

1503
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:27,770
of finances we've continually scheduled

1504
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:30,560
meetings based on finding some random

1505
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:31,380
host and we end up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful cities</font>

1506
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,680
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alba</font>

1507
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">perky and not very many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people come and</font>

1508
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:40,379
we hold them in San Francisco and wow

1509
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:44,459
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised we have so many</font>

1510
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:46,950
attendees<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow I mean it's like I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1511
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:49,319
a v6 meeting last week and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1512
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:55,470
we're running out of ipv4 space into the

1513
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:58,890
absolute shocker um so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways we</font>

1514
01:07:55,470 --> 01:08:01,169
can change things when our goals are in

1515
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:02,848
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one example and I don't</font>

1516
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:05,910
want to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a bunch because all it</font>

1517
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:07,680
does is bring up bad blood about the way

1518
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:10,440
things have been running decisions but I

1519
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:13,769
think they're significant ways that we

1520
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:17,940
can evolve and change on how we actually

1521
01:08:13,769 --> 01:08:20,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">run the organization and and just to be</font>

1522
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:22,169
clear I<font color="#E5E5E5"> set it on list but I should say</font>

1523
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:25,920
it here I think membership plus

1524
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:27,750
attendance model is I mean I can name

1525
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:34,799
the number of organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

1526
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:37,259
that way you know um to go back to what

1527
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:39,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">BJ said earlier by the way facility and</font>

1528
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:41,460
other people I forget whom sorry have

1529
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:43,020
actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together a budget that we</font>

1530
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:45,120
will be presenting tomorrow which allows

1531
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:46,980
you to perturb the bases and look at

1532
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,858
what happens if something goes wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1533
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:52,019
the membership goes down etc etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

1534
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:53,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">information is there this was mostly to</font>

1535
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:55,889
give you guys a preview the<font color="#E5E5E5"> baath</font>

1536
01:08:53,908 --> 01:08:59,068
tomorrow we'll have much more in depth

1537
01:08:55,889 --> 01:09:00,449
detailed information by the way in terms

1538
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:02,429
of future things that people have

1539
01:09:00,448 --> 01:09:05,068
suggested and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I like any</font>

1540
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:06,779
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> because some of them I like and</font>

1541
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:07,830
some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't like but things</font>

1542
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have been suggested like on the</font>

1545
01:09:11,639 --> 01:09:18,210
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to think of more things one</font>

1546

was<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcps another was doing more</font>

1547
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:22,799
professional development stuff another

1548
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:26,189
was more sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a common core network</font>

01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:27,269
engineering education I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's</font>

1550
01:09:26,189 --> 01:09:28,799
probably five or ten more things that

1551
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would think of I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys</font>

1552
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,679
are concerned with<font color="#E5E5E5"> not breaking anything</font>

1553
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,600
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition but I think a lot</font>

1554
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people out here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be thinking</font>

1555
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,889
about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in a year or two when</font>

1556
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:41,670
this transition is fully done and

1557
01:09:37,889 --> 01:09:43,409
nothing is broken and you know what

1558
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:44,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would like to see and if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1559
01:09:43,408 --> 01:09:46,410
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it maybe they should</font>

1560
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:47,940
start working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I certainly think</font>

1561
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:49,318
that we shouldn't wait for the steering

1562
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:51,599
committee but if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

1563
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:55,560
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp working group or if someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font>

1564
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start you know a a network engineer</font>

1565
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,660
Corps education working group or

1566
01:09:57,989 --> 01:10:02,459
whatever you know people should just

1567
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand up and say they're going to start</font>

1568
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recruit people and</font>

1569
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,400
start working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it because I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

1570
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:11,940
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got our own organization all of</font>

1571
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:18,330
that stuff becomes a possibility and

1572
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:23,969
interestingly interestingly I got a text

1573
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:25,949
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a new comment you people</font>

1574
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:28,410
are impressive I don't even know who did

1575
01:10:25,949 --> 01:10:29,879
it because apparently that number is not

1576
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:32,370
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> address book so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might want to</font>

1577
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:34,679
tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you are but it is a reminder</font>

1578
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:36,719
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve said this earlier but a</font>

1582
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,960
futures if they don't come to the

1583
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:45,090
community meeting if they just you know

1584
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">show up and go to the plenary they</font>

1585
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:48,090
shouldn't notice anything happen this is

1586
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,830
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a no op or at least that's</font>

1587
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:51,780
the plan you're just going to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1588
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:52,920
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year it's still going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog</font>

1589
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,900
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look just like it was</font>

1590
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,460
before like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said or at least that's</font>

1591
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,110
the plan if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that to be</font>

1592
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">different than you should don't join one</font>

1593
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:07,380
of the working groups and see what you

1594
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:10,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do to change things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Leo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bicknell is</font>

1595
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:13,679
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is largely a</font>

1596
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:17,219
natural progression and I think part of

1597
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:20,190
the answer to why now is you have to

1598
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:23,280
have people in place who want to make it

1599
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:27,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen and so if we have that now that</font>

1600
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:29,759
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the right time I do think my</font>

1601
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:33,150
concern is is kind of similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1602
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,730
Vijay articulated while I don't follow

1603
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:39,599
this in great detail I've heard stories

1604
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:41,099
of meetings gone by where various things

1605
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,699
have gone wrong and ended up costing

1606
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:46,590
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money and you know</font>

1607
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:48,389
unbalanced over<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font>

1608
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">nanog loses money but certainly on any</font>

1609
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:54,989
individual meeting it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1610
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:56,360
in the red quite badly and so my worry

1611
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:58,669
in setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a new</font>

1612
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:01,400
is it dies a young embryonic death

1613
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:03,440
because you know we pick a meeting

1614
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,089
location and six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later there's an</font>

1615
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,980
earthquake in San Francisco falls in the

1616
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">bay or BP spilled oil or whatever</font>

1617
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:13,250
happens outside of our control and I

1618
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:16,700
haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet a lot of planning or</font>

1619
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:18,290
reassurances for sort of you know the

1620
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,700
really bad things that can happen and I

1621
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:22,460
understand it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> more coming out tomorrow</font>

1622
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:24,470
in the ball but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be truly supportive</font>

1623
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:27,080
of it that's that's the piece that that

1624
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:29,930
I feel I need more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information on for</font>

1625
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:33,410
four events that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> four events</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1626
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:35,750
are truly outside our control most there

1627
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:37,790
are things like conference cancellation

1628
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,320
insurance which usually run fairly cheap

1629
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:42,170
it's like one buck on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred bucks</font>

1630
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:44,450
per outlay sure that those are those are

1631
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:46,190
folded into the budget absolutely and I

1632
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:48,139
think I'm more concerned about I no

1633
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,669
instances before<font color="#E5E5E5"> where nanog has ended</font>

1634
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:52,520
up costing you know 50 grand more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

1635
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:54,860
anybody budgeted because whatever XYZ

1636
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,660
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs money and stuff but you</font>

1637
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:58,190
know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have a reserve one</font>

1638
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:02,480
of the nice things merit brings right

1639
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:03,830
now is they have a reserve and we keep

1640
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,179
talking about you know as we plan

1641
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:07,160
further out the liability gets bigger

1642
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:09,890
right we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got three hotels out booked</font>

1643
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:11,210
instead of one or whatever so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so</font>

1644
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:13,970
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a concern where I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

1645
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:19,040
a little more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really on board with</font>

an outsider his viewpoint is the

1658
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:04,070
independence is the payoff and that we

1659
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,369
oughtn't be looking back<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we ought</font>
