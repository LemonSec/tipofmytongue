related to how we do those things the

191
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,920
best place I would think would be nanog

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,720
futures which is unmoderated so you can

193

the stuff we've heard so far if I don't

201
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,149
see anybody to Mike so I'm guessing that

202
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:19,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that there aren't any but I wanted</font>

is is there a jab room or some other way

<font color="#CCCCCC">for someone to raise questions via</font>

207
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,979
remote participation and the answer is

208
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,520
heck if I know so I figured I jump up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

something that we would love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do we</font>

328
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,430
to be in January in February although I

329
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,189
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look this up in the the average</font>

high temperature in miami in February is

331
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:32,040
a mere 77 degrees so I think oddly Miami

332
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,850
will not be as pleasant a place to be as

333

448
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,809
of success since that we have a program

committee that is responsible for the

450
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,450
conference content we have a

451
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,100
communications committee formerly known

452
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,350
as the mailing list community committee

453
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:29,418
which manages the mailing list that

454
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,600
performs its job of minimal moderation

455
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:34,490
while trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep things on track and</font>

456
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,530
we've created a marketing working group

457
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,500
which is doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful job of</font>

458
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,379
getting more sponsorship opportunities

459
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,549
for us

460
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:48,210
that means better brakes more beer more

461
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:48,210
gear and more more funds flowing in

462
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,720
still again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll that net August is</font>

ultimately it's their their money<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,750
their risk their reward so you might be

466
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,549
asking why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change this we</font>

467
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,049
have a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments model we've</font>

468
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:12,700
demonstrated that clearly I think over

469
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:17,799
the last few years but we have a little

470
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit limited ability to act we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

471
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:23,470
been saying for the last three slides

472
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:26,070
merit tonight's activity they control

473
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money they control what happens</font>

474
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,939
again that's nothing wrong with that

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,370
that's the way it is but we think we

476
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to do better and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

477
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:39,360
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other question people have</font>

478
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:42,639
been asking is why we're doing this now

479
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,580
well the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that our kind of</font>

480
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,030
complex we started talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

481
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,139
January during the meeting in Austin and

482
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,580
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sat on it for a while and tried</font>

483
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,370
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if we really still thought</font>

484
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,799
we we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this we by the way is</font>

485
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,790
the steering<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee and bunch of</font>

486
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,129
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talked to another</font>

487
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,230
committee is in from the community so

488
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just six of us in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the back room</font>

489
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:10,840
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 12 to 15 of us in a side room</font>

490
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:13,090
I guess but we've talked to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

491
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and got a lot of input and as we</font>

492
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,600
move forward with this we want more more

493
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,179
and more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we really don't want it</font>

494
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,189
to be driven solely by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steering</font>

495
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:24,280
committee it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

496
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:29,260
community effort anyways to continue

497
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:32,110
with this the question as to why now we

498
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,000
tried to time it so that work within

499
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,610
merits budget cycle which ends on june

500
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,169
thirtieth one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes people</font>

501
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,090
really upset is if you go to them with

502
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:41,679
new wonderful expansion or change plans

503
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,049
right after they've done their budgets

504
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,480
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year so we tried to do it</font>

505
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:48,668
beforehand

506
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,990
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be taken into</font>

507
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:56,080
account is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> meerut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hotel Hotel</font>

508
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:57,370
contracts for dan I was 50 and 51 as

509
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,559
well as the one we're at now in the

510
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:02,350
previous ones so that's two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the few</font>

511
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:04,540
meetings in the next fiscal year that

512
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,678
controls in large part the timing of

513
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:10,030
when a new transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen so the</font>

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">green text at the bottom we believe it's</font>

521
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:32,320

membership owns the organization and

527
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,500
controls what happens that's the theme

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've heard of earlier but in this</font>

in for conferences and goes out to pay

for the conferences and other things we

it's not in here but what that means for

us is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have with increased</font>

fees at a reasonable level as perhaps

568
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:45,020
the cost of hotels goes up and the cost

569
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:49,230
of cookies goes up and things like that

570
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:52,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay financial reporting again with us</font>

571
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:55,590
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisory role what we see of the</font>

572
00:26:52,650 --> 00:27:00,929
finances is same reports that you see

573
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:03,620
here every three months four months my

574
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:07,530
understanding is that nana is not a

575
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:10,469
separate bank account or pseudo bank

576
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:13,350
account within merit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's funded</font>

577
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:19,860
like any other project and budget in

578
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:23,668
that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on as by taking it into</font>

579
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,260
it ourselves that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we will see</font>

580
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:27,270
everything and will be financially

581
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:32,129
accountable to to our membership which

582
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:33,870
we hope to be you guys staffing right

583
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,720
now all the hard work here is done by

584
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,479
the merit staff and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reiterate</font>

585
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,470
that I I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Garrett has done a really</font>

586
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:46,710
good job with all of this and the water

587
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:48,990
plans are no way reflection on the

588
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,539
people who make all this stuff here in

589
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,789
the meeting happen for for us again we

590
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:58,490
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would be in a bare room</font>

591
00:27:53,789 --> 00:28:01,799
with no AV and no nothing and no cookies

592
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:05,720
so we intend as it as a new organization

593
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:07,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a limited paid staff</font>

594
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,900
probably an executive director or

595
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,490
something like that maybe if we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

596
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,160
wonder to other people to handle stuff

597
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:17,100
but to contract that most of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

598
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:22,440
don't need a full-time event staff to

599
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:23,959
throw three meetings a year so well we

600
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,430
don't think we need to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

601
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:33,180
there's potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> for efficiencies there</font>

602
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:35,940
we believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right more slides so</font>

603
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,100
mission statement stays the same we're

604
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,750
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yep</font>

605
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,000
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep organizing</font>

606
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,430
conferences and have a mailing list the

607
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,870
goal is still to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> forms for the</font>

608
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:50,280
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sharing of knowledge in</font>

609
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:51,780
the North American region nothing new we

610
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,790
believe we have will have flexibility to

611
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,220
do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that we can expand our</font>

612
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:58,170
education and<font color="#E5E5E5"> outreach programs we could</font>

613
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,130
find ways of expanding online forums

614
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:03,840
like my page every room we could explore

615
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,360
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some interesting stuff on</font>

616
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:11,220
the features list recently of things

617
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:14,929
like publications or certifications or

618
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:19,140
things like that these are things that

619
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:20,490
moving more towards a don't say

620
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,960
professional organization because that

621
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,440
actually needs something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in IRS speak</font>

622
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,680
but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> but more of a group of</font>

623
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,140
professionals I with with a goal toward

624
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,960
education educating people that we can

625
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:39,630
accomplish if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">devote to that the governance so we've</font>

627

emphasize the transitional nature of it

631
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think any of us expects in three</font>

up calling ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on if we can</font>

committee members

641
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:24,330
as we grow we're going to mirror the

642
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:27,540
existing other committees so that people

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,460
to build a membership-based by

648
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,720
decoupling it from conference attendance

anybody has serious take part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

653
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:55,620
concept of requiring a paid membership

654
00:30:51,960 --> 00:31:02,070
to be on the mailing list so that's not

655
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:02,729
going to happen we don't intend to but

656
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,409
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would be appropriate</font>

657
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,630
either to require membership to be here

658
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,040
in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings one thing that may</font>

659
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,360
happen is that if you become remember

660
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,129
you may get a little registration

661
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,540
discount which might have offset the

662
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,890
cost of membership but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know those</font>

663
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:18,600
are things to be worked out and funding

664
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,429
by we want more funding from membership

665
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,469
and sponsor organizations and other

666
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:26,120
contributors so that we're not relying

667
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:31,440
solely on meeting registration revenues

668
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:32,939
to fund<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything here's more about the</font>

669
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,270
membership should read the slides before

<font color="#E5E5E5">I started talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about them something</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to mention here also is that</font>

672
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:43,980
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these are it says proposal at</font>

673
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,160
the top that's because what they are we

on the board and<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisors we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

676
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,580
have throwing out ideas which are going

677
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,799
to seed some discussions but we're

678
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,480
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> some committees which will</font>

679
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:02,970
actually come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with real concrete</font>

680
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,650
proposals for what violation of the club

681
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,470
memberships should work on some other

682
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">things most i'll get to in a little bit</font>

683
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,700
those committees are going to be chaired

684
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,299
by people not on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> artist in</font>

this organization to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be what you guys</font>

689
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,919
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and to continue down that route it</font>

691
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,850
we think that model worked out quite

692
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:33,809
well during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition back in 2005</font>

693
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:36,480
and we want to see it happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so</font>

694
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:39,720
that's that our ideas for how things

695
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,700
ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work there's a current nano</font>

voting membership population all of you

697

are eligible to vote in the net our

698

having been here anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else who has</font>

700

been to a meeting in the last two years

701
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,159
or since the beginning of 2009 I guess

702
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:58,860
we'll be eligible to vote in that

703
00:32:53,159 --> 00:33:00,960
election we intend somehow to have the

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,210
basically in any of it business it needs

713
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,590
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done as part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nu nog as opposed</font>

714
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:30,450
to dig and merit so we have a bit of

715
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">work ahead of us to figure out how we're</font>

716
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,510
going to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the joint election</font>

717
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,740
stuff and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure things that actually</font>

718
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:39,840
work smoothly so that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to</font>

719
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question of when we get to vote on</font>

720
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,080
this and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer that said</font>

721
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't mean that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

722
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,990
not say anything now if you have

723
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,510
opinions or concerns or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

724
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,559
this is the time to ring them up during

725
00:33:54,510 --> 00:34:01,590
these next couple of days and beyond

726
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:05,340
let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> else we have here some</font>

727
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:08,429
other ideas I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

728
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,770
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the big ideas big reason for</font>

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:12,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a membership is that there</font>

730
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:15,540
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to be eligible</font>

732
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,259
attended a meeting they participate in

733
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,609
the mailing lists they do other net on

734
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,379
stuff but they can't physically make it

735
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:26,369
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to enable them to that</font>

736
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:28,348
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> a member will probably involve</font>

737
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:30,059
paying some dues

738
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:32,819
we have run out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all sorts of numbers</font>

739
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:35,989
on that who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what it will end up</font>

740
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:40,379
looking like<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't be very high but</font>

741
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:42,690
it'll be nonzero probably we started

742
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:45,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about the idea of discounted</font>

743
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:48,089
membership for students who can't afford

744
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:51,179
anything my son my son<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs some ramen</font>

745
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:54,469
a lot he's away college so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doubt if</font>

746
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,339
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford membership let's see</font>

747
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:58,410
members get voting rights new no

discounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> our subscription plans for</font>

750
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:06,390

751
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,210
like pre pay in advance for<font color="#CCCCCC"> n</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings</font>

752
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:11,879
and get a slight discount on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

753
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,779
maybe other future benefits and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be</font>

754
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,359
a sticker you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could stick on your</font>

756
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:25,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">conferences enlist we've been discussing</font>

757
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:28,099
ways that we can change the way we fund

758
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:35,238
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conference's more money from</font>

759
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:37,609
sponsors and possibly from hosts we

760
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:45,539
think perhaps we can save<font color="#CCCCCC"> some money and</font>

761
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:48,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">hotel costs if we use a professionals</font>

762
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:51,989
who do that sort of thing for a living

763
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:57,719
we want to outsource the adult stuff

764
00:35:51,989 --> 00:36:00,089
like registration management and on-site

765
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:03,049
logistics things like running the

766
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and a wireless and all that</font>

767
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:07,288
again is no reason to hire paid staff to

768
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,509
do it when you only hold it in two or

769
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,249
three meetings a year and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">contracted out to people who are</font>

776
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,670
we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">meaningless server in my garage and</font>

depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my goodwill to keep it writing</font>

779
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:41,860
we want somebody whose job it is to do

780
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,820
that and if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want money to do it</font>

781
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,950
we'll pay them if they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> donate</font>

782
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:49,460
the resources that's fine too will

783
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:51,020
happily take donations but we got it

784
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,200
done professionally right now it's done

785
00:36:51,020 --> 00:37:00,110
professionally we don't want to change

786
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that here's a timeline this is a</font>

787
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:05,960
question of a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

788
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:09,350
asking we finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some answers so</font>

789
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,090
right now you can see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's orange</font>

790
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:14,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">and black neon they change color since I</font>

791
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:16,730
saw this last so the orange bar is

792
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">mirrored operating the meetings the</font>

793
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:21,770
black bar is do not about writing the

794
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,210
meetings you can see the gap between<font color="#CCCCCC"> 951</font>

795
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,580
which is the meeting at Miami and

796
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:27,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">january-february and then I'm 52</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

797
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:32,180
is the meeting in denver in<font color="#E5E5E5"> june i</font>

798
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:35,779
believe it is up next year so and then

799
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,009
you see ah ok so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt's</font>

800
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,420
running in meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> marital</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you</font>

801
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,880
need to run the meetings as they have

802
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,610
been for those that they have hotel

803
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,380
contracts for that's obviously the right

804
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:48,620
thing to do they have the liability they

805
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:52,310
need to control their revenue stream and

806
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:54,859
all that there's a red line in<font color="#E5E5E5"> October</font>

807
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:57,920
which is when we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have the</font>

808
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:02,300
election to try to ratify all of this

809
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:05,390
and make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really happen starting with</font>

810
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:09,470
nano 52 in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Denver the new organization</font>

811
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:11,540
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the meetings we've been</font>

812
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:15,080
talking with merit about the possibility

813
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,580
of having them provide the meeting

814
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">services much as they do now for that</font>

815
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:22,730
meeting as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use the transition</font>

816
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:27,890
we expect that that will work out and

817
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:29,810
over there out now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 53 and beyond is</font>

818
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,080
when we start having the opportunity to

819
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:34,130
explore<font color="#CCCCCC"> new ways of doing things</font>

820
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,400
possibly working with other vendors to

821
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:39,359
do things

822
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:44,160
and we'll see how that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit</font>

823
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,869
certainly if they're interested is a

824
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,049
possible choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> submitter for that as</font>

825
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:53,039
well be their choices to whether they're

826
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:55,369
interested or not and but it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

827
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,200
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a competitive bidding type of thing</font>

828
00:38:55,369 --> 00:39:00,150
one other thing to point out Nanak 52

829
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,910
the dead of a meeting we have a hill

830
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,559
comp nu nog itself as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel contract</font>

831
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,879
which we signed two weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

832
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,319
that meeting is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen we</font>

833
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,240
talked to tell distance will be our host

834
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:13,558
for that now 53<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin actually signed the</font>

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">contract</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that meeting back a few</font>

836
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:18,420
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we started talking about all</font>

837
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,730
of this we want to thank Aaron for going

838
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,339
out on a limb doing that for us we don't

839
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,710
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's much mm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we think we</font>

840
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:28,710
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing here but that said</font>

841
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:32,099
Aaron did step up<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you did a quick</font>

842
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:35,339
decision and put themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> out on a</font>

843
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,650
limb for us we appreciate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

844
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,880
beyond that comes a 2012 which we will

845
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,880
start planning for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the near future</font>

846
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:55,500
so last slide in this part<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but less</font>

852
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the work so that we</font>

853
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:10,289
can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit back and enjoy the rewards</font>

854
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,940
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work that way it's going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be governance working group whose job it</font>

856
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,609
will be to figure out what the bylaws

857
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:18,690
the new organizations should look like

858
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:20,609

membership working group whose

862
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:29,190
responsibility will be to forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

863
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,760
the membership really looks like how

864
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,410
much members<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paying if they're</font>

deal with students things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

867
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:41,130
then of course that are part of the job

868
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,288
will be to go out and and pester all of

875
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:59,390
huge overlap between that and the

876
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:01,130
current marketing working group since a

877
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,529
lot of the responsibilities are the same

878
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:06,369
and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that as part of</font>

879
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:10,059
the process that the marketing

880
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:15,229
sponsorship model does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> break for the</font>

881
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:17,769
four then I was 50 and 51 things need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

882
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:21,229
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same as they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

883
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:22,729
let's see what else we got finance

884
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:25,098
budget working group these people will

885
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:28,960
be doing some oversight to make sure

886
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:28,960
that our budgets actually are saying and

887
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:34,910
and help us create budgets down the road

888
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:37,339

890
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:42,739
numbers on it which we believe are

891
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,930
fairly realistic their job will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to</font>

892
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:46,579
take those numbers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find them even</font>

893
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:51,259
further and dig down into more the

933
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:42,780
a few words many of you saw my posting

934
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:46,009
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog future but essentially the way</font>

935
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:49,580
this happened we at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt thought that</font>

936
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:51,930
that we were in a position where if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

937
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:53,610
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fight this transition</font>

938
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:56,160
obviously we thought this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong</font>

939
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,390
thing we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard if we thought</font>

940
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right thing we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have</font>

941
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">done it before before we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we could</font>

942
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:05,040
run nanog very well but if we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

943
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,230
fight that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to debate with</font>

944
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,960
the volunteers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> make nanog happen</font>

945
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,270
and as you know nanog is a

946
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,370
volunteer-driven organization it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

947
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:17,250
makes nanog your great organization an

948
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:19,680
open debate wouldn't serve the community

949
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:22,410
at all so we've decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help its</font>

950
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:26,190
transition we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to debate with</font>

951
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:28,470
any any of the current members of the

952
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:32,190
community and we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support</font>

953
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:34,580
this the the best that we can that's all

954
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,580
thanks

955
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,279
thanks Don we appreciate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

956
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,720
you use the word differences among

957
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,700
friends when we were meeting the other

958
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,058
day and that's really what what this is

959
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,169
looking like we obviously disagree on

960
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:53,660
whether this is the right move<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we</font>

961
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:56,630
agree that moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

962
00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:00,220
professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> and friendly manner is much</font>

963
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:02,420
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> fragmenting things so</font>

964
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:06,558
Patrick you had some questions from IRC

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Merit nog carry over to nu nog and</font>

968
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:15,470

although<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has promised</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help out any</font>

973
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,109
way which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice of him the</font>

974
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:25,789
second question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how does merit feel</font>

975
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:28,640
about this I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

976
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:30,230
that there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> letters on noon org</font>

977
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,359
from Merritt that you can read or you

978
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,970
can go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and ask Don or some of</font>

979
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:36,799
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> mayor of people how about the</font>

980
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,319
IP space is that isn't it a reserved

981
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:42,170
block that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also covered in the</font>

982
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:44,119
letters<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are on the new Norg website</font>

983
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,650
merit plans to keep the IP space we're

984
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,349
looking into getting a micro allocation

985
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,339
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and somebody</font>

986
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,619
asked whether we're only 10 minutes

987
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:54,140
allocated we didn't actually allocate

988
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:55,640
anything so first of all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just decided</font>

989
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:59,058
to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time at the community</font>

990
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,180
meeting which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now there is a bawth</font>

991
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:03,589
tomorrow which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be more fully</font>

992
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,990
encompassing and discussing all those

993
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:07,190
stuff 90 minutes and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was</font>

994
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,379
walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I noticed that the sign</font>

995
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:11,270
outside said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting went to 715</font>

996
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,970
even though the schedule says it goes to

997
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:16,099
6 45 so we can keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess if you</font>

998
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,808
guys don't mind although<font color="#CCCCCC"> i might start</font>

999
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:19,579
sticking needles in my eyes it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1000
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:21,319
too long and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions</font>

1001
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:25,869
from IRC if you have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> more you can</font>

1002
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:30,410
either put them on pound nanog on the

whichever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terror terahertz net IRC</font>

1005
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:38,110
your friend

1006
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,980
um thank you very much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing all</font>

1007
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:44,470
this information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I shared on</font>

1008
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mailing list that this was one of</font>

1009
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that was discussed and even</font>

1010
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,250
the very first steering<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee</font>

1011
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:54,270
meeting the idea that a steering

1012
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:57,430
committee is only an advisory the

1013
00:46:54,270 --> 00:47:00,130
committee<font color="#CCCCCC"> to merit did have some</font>

1014
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,649
limitations even way back then so that

1015
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be the right avenue to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go down but I</font>

1016
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,210
guess I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some mixed signals and</font>

1017
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:09,460
I'm hoping you could clear up with a

1018
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of these questions the first is</font>

1019
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:17,050
is this a done deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1020
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:22,480
it's a done deal i'd say we're well down

1021
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:25,210
the path certainly if there is a reason

1022
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so including possibly huge outcry</font>

1023
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:31,620
from you guys I imagine it's still

1024
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:35,320
possible to change directions certainly

1025
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,609
it would be possible to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1026
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong set of people is in charge and you</font>

1027
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">can change or in charge of transition</font>

1028
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,850
that is or new dog and change<font color="#CCCCCC"> this out I</font>

1029
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:45,730
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't want to stick around</font>

1030
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:48,480
if people think that doing the job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1031
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:51,010
think the others will kill same way I

1032
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,570
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you up until the election in</font>

1033
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,030
October that there's still opportunity

1034
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:57,850
that side of the we have started<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font>

1035
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">down a path there are contractual things</font>

1036
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,589
that would need to be resolved if we

1037
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,960
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn around and go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back I</font>

1038
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:07,060
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say its interminable though I</font>

1039
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,860
guess the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font>

1040
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,350
really do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see some financials</font>

1041
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,480
there's enough overhead in what you're

1042
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:16,240
describing as the replacement for the

1043
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:20,410
status<font color="#E5E5E5"> quo that one could see the cost</font>

1044
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,609
getting very quickly pretty high<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes</font>

1045
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,500
I know you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to save some</font>

1046
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:25,180
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some hotel stuff and you can do</font>

1047
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,880
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweaks here and there to adjust the</font>

1048
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cost structures but at this point it</font>

1049
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,210
sounds like you're saying it's more or

1050
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,460
less a done deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we really don't</font>

1051
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:35,920
know what this new overarching structure

1052
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,450
is so i encourage you to include<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1053
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,760
community and there's much information

1054
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:44,319
as you can about the budget requirements

1055
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,730
for this new body we will be sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1056
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,270
pro forma budget during the meeting

1057
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">tomorrow</font>

1058
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:49,570
the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why we didn't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1059
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,850
it today is because we were told<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1060
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:54,700
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here six minutes from</font>

1061
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,990
now that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out to not be</font>

1062
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,960
the case but that said we haven't

1063
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:01,930
prepared in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide deck that the</font>

1064
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,100
stuff that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over that if</font>

1065
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:06,100
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to stick around for</font>

1066
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">another hour I suppose we could but also</font>

1067
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:12,430
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on who but people up here</font>

1068
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:13,569
gets it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that long guess we'll have to</font>

1069
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:20,129
say on that we do we do have numbers we

1070
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:26,020
doin had to show them with you yeah

1071
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:29,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright if Dan's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer I think</font>

1072
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,430
bills question i'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> him go first</font>

1073
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:36,910
just to the comment on bills question in

1074
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,040
terms of the money that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being spent</font>

1075
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,120
there's I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of politics going</font>

1076
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,740
on here and I think the steering

1077
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,290
committee members are being very

1078
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,850
cautious of how the interact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> mayor</font>

1079
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,980
and I think the Americas are being very

1080
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,240
cautious and it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you know</font>

1081
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,190
through this transition I think people

1082
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:53,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to be a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> delicate and how</font>

1083
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,650
they go about things but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the</font>

1084
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:58,120
budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in terms of the expenditures</font>

1085
00:49:55,650 --> 00:50:01,000
you know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do not</font>

1086
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a tremendous amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of intelligence</font>

1087
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,430
on how merit exactly spent every penny

1088
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:08,860
looking at it and comparing it in a pro

1089
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:10,299
forma way to other similar conferences

1090
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,640
and how much conference management

1091
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,650
services cost and how much the overhead

1092
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,359
should be at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in time there</font>

1093
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,580
isn't a lot of additional efficiencies

1094
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,350
merit can squeeze out if you compared to

1095
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,600
maybe two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago there were</font>

1096
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,400
some really big inefficiencies but over

1097
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past two or three years I think</font>

1098
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,450
Betty in particular squeezed a lot of

1099
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,800
inefficiencies out that being said in

1100
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:33,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of what it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost us to</font>

1101
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:36,130
actually run you know these conferences

1102
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:38,020
I think that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could in terms</font>

1103
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,940
of the staffing and the overhead rather

1104
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,290
than the conference services we could

1105
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly save some money there we're</font>

1106
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,860
not going to get into a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1107
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,540
it's like oh my god you know it's going

1108
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cost us much more to do this than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1109
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,590
costs Marit Marit did not have

1110
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,200
particular efficiencies in the in this

1111
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:55,300
way in fact by going to the approach

1112
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,649
Steve talked about and going for

1113
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:59,589
professional conference management

1114
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:01,359
services we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can probably</font>

1115
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:03,640
squeeze out some additional efficiencies

1116
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,380
on the overhead side the<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit simply</font>

1117
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,219
couldn't because you know they were

1118
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:10,749
doing 10 or 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 30 other conferences</font>

1119
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:12,880
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think as we move forward I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1120
00:51:10,749 --> 00:51:14,738
this is kind of a convoluted answer but

1121
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,109
the the chance that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1122
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:18,880
to stop in six months and say wow<font color="#CCCCCC"> mara</font>

1123
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:22,210
was doing this much cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we are</font>

1124
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,859
that's extremely unlikely compared to

1125
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:26,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we know of our comparison between</font>

1126
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:28,808
this and other conferences but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1127
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:31,029
basing any forward-looking decisions on

1128
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:38,049
our ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get additional funding</font>

1129
00:51:31,029 --> 00:51:40,229
beyond which merit got so I noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1130
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:43,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the emails that were up on the website</font>

1131
00:51:40,229 --> 00:51:45,640
that you guys wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty thousand</font>

1132
00:51:43,029 --> 00:51:47,619
dollars to transfer the name nanog and

1133
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,509
the and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font>

1134
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:51,249
where that number comes from why you

1135
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:54,009
think the nanog name is worth thirty

1136
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:55,450
thousand dollars and if it might make

1137
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:56,950
more sense for us to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

1138
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,859
different name rather than pay that or

1139
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:01,598
where that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number is coming from which</font>

1140
00:51:59,859 --> 00:52:04,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just in theory just looking at the</font>

1141
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,619
the domain we kind of appraised<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1142
00:52:04,299 --> 00:52:06,849
domain a little bit and it kind of came

1143
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:19,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">out to about three hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and forty</font>

1144
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:21,910
dollars Sudan so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way nonprofits get</font>

1145
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:24,729
in the most trouble is called as

1146
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:26,739
conflicts of interest so we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1147
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:29,979
University of Michigan office of

1148
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:33,069
technology transfer and they said the

1149
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:34,808
domain and the trademark name are worth

1150
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:39,910
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty and fifty thousand</font>

1151
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:43,420
dollars and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we gave the name in</font>

1152
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,999
the domain to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new nu nog somebody</font>

1153
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,719
who attended a meeting at some point

1154
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:48,729
somebody who was on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> steering</font>

1155
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,670
committee five years ago could raise a

1156
00:52:48,729 --> 00:52:53,649
stink and say you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gave it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1157
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:56,710
them you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to me so</font>

1158
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:59,140
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a hard documentation in an</font>

1159
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:01,960
exchange at market value for something

1160
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:05,049
of value then both organizations are

1161
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,269
protected now yet we put a price tag of

1162
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:09,819
thirty thousand dollars as we as we said

1163
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:11,288
with Steve and Sylvie well you know we

1164
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">could say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you start paying that</font>

1165
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:15,279
once your reserve gets too

1166
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:17,239
100,000 or 200,000 or you could pay

1167
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:20,779
thousand dollars a year or something

1168
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:23,440
like that but but the idea that there is

1169
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:31,430
a an exchange of something of value

1170
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:34,039
that's documented protects us both Randy

a hotel contract in order to facilitate

00:55:21,339 --> 00:55:28,180
this we do not in that moment intend to

1202
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:30,220
take sides or say that this should be

1203

done or shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done but it looked</font>

1204
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:35,859
like it was happening and we were happy

1205
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:38,380
to help etc we are now carrying that

1206
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:40,900
contract as a liability on our books and

1207
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:43,930
we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> counting on somebody to</font>

wanted to say I hope something happens

and thank you Paul and in there and for

stepping in and doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

appreciate it that means there will be a

1217
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:16,660
observation would be having<font color="#E5E5E5"> watched the</font>

00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:19,270
government governance and voting process

1219
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:22,569
in nanog is you know we only get one

1220
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:26,349
shot at this once a year which is we

1221
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:29,500
vote at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fall Meeting so you know we</font>

1222

<font color="#E5E5E5">need the constructs which are the rule</font>

changes to be you know in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

1224
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,910
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and then so that we actually</font>

1225
00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:40,180
can vote on a new charter and move on

1226
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:43,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the other observation I would make</font>

1227
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:46,240
is yes since we're booking hotels and

1228
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:49,089
things with long-term future liabilities

1229
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:52,750
I mean that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this is about</font>

1230
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:56,920
in terms of the organizational construct

1231
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:59,140
that's created and so we will actually

1232
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,240
rather quickly arrive at the point of no

1233
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:04,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">return on this because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we will book a</font>

1234
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:07,750
hotel for some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> in what the end of</font>

1235
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:09,220
2011 or the beginning of 2012 and that

1236
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:13,660
will be

1237
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:15,879
you know on somebody's books actually

1238
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:18,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel sub hotel has already been</font>

1239
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:24,220
booked by the organization for june of

1240
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:25,839
next year and so unless we're told not

1241
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:30,609
to we tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and hold a</font>

1242
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:32,560

1243
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:34,000
imagine there were ways we could deal

1244
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:40,750
with that but I don't want to see it

1245
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:43,200
happen not someone else must have

1246
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,200
questions

1250
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,849
forth it all breaks down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you know</font>

you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your mission statement</font>

essentially staying the same but there

the line four years down the line like

1257
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:06,169

putting liabilities on the table for a

00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:26,359
bet<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't quite understand what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the pale it's going to be and that you</font>

00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:31,490
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's maybe my uneducated on you</font>

1269
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:33,829
know steering committee point of view on

1270
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:35,919
this but that's at least one set of

1271
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:38,990
questions that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been seeing this</font>

00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,670
go on over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know 6-8 weeks</font>

1274
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:45,020
back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mind where is this going to</font>

1275
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:49,129
be 23 years from now when kind of its

1276
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:51,589
supposedly firing on all cylinders what

1277
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:54,950
if you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> be friend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be sure I</font>

1278
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:56,710
first just to clarify the role<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Todd</font>

1279
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:58,609
and I have we've been advisors to the

steering<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee through this process</font>

on kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of financial and events stuff we</font>

1282
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:04,009
we weren't part of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision but</font>

1283
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,200
we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help them out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font>

1284
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:07,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made so to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer your</font>

1285
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,189
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about liabilities these</font>

1286
00:59:07,819 --> 00:59:12,020
liabilities always<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist so someone was</font>

1287
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:14,359
always assuming these liabilities in the

1288
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:16,670
past it was merit and because merit was

1289
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:17,930
was assuming these liabilities it let

1290
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:21,140
them do stuff like decide when to

1291
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:23,180
schedule conferences to decide how many

1292
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,319
conferences to do a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decide how</font>

00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">long they are to decide how they're</font>

1294
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:29,690
scheduled to to pick one host over

1295
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:31,849
another host to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

1296
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:34,039
that the SC was sort of originally

00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:35,720
designed to start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over the</font>

could say well listen we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this</font>

1301
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:43,190
huge contract liability so it's unfair

1302
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:46,250
for you guys to exert any kind of

1303
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:47,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">control over this so you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1304
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:51,289
unfair we've got to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> making these</font>

1305
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:53,779
decisions what's gone on more recently

1306
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:55,269
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because someone else is assuming</font>

1307
00:59:53,779 --> 00:59:57,039
these liabilities which is the new name

1308
00:59:55,269 --> 00:59:58,928
organization and they're not you know

00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:02,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just a different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy with the same</font>

1310
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:04,390
liability now the SC can start making

1311
01:00:02,229 --> 01:00:07,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">these decisions for us and we elect them</font>

1312
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:08,589
and they're responsible to us and you

1313
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:11,408
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sort of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it works in</font>

the closer so nano governance is now I

think reached a point of democratic

self-sustaining we've had two or three

some point you could have said it's

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this level of comfort actually it's</font>

about the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of institution and set of</font>

01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:50,349
processes we've built and we're all

1360
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:51,968
becoming much more comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1361
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:53,079
trusting that you know if we don't like

01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:54,130
these people were already talking about

1363

<font color="#E5E5E5">if we don't like what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're doing</font>

1364
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:57,189
we'll just vote them out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go put</font>

people in who will do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want and</font>

1366
01:01:57,189 --> 01:02:02,229
that's that level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of maturity has been</font>

1367
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:04,509
consistently bumping up against the

1368
01:02:02,229 --> 01:02:06,549
friction which is the reality that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1369
01:02:04,509 --> 01:02:08,470
know it's not been talked about

1370
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:10,540
enormously in public but now

1371
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:13,509
has been purely an activity of merit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1372
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:15,220
merits responsibility is to deal with

1373
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:17,290
that enormous fiscal responsibility of

1374
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:19,299
the hotel contracts to their<font color="#CCCCCC"> credit we</font>

1375
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:21,130
pushed them hard to plan more nanog

1376
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,230
further into the future so that we could

1377
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,700
all plan our meeting attendance and we

1378
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,590
could get better hosts and we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1379
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,419
the cities we wanted and conferences we

1380
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:29,830
wanted in dates we wanted but then on

1381
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,480
their books they see that future

1382
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:33,250
liability going up and up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their</font>

happens is there has been a natural

01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:44,140
divergence of time of the perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

how<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should work the</font>

01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:52,480
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their perception of what's</font>

01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and now now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get more and more</font>

1393
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,650
frustrated by the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legal</font>

1394
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:58,868
and fiscal reality is that now gives

controlled by merit so and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1396
01:02:58,869 --> 01:03:03,490
not something specific long that anyone

01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:05,580
did it's just been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term maturity</font>

1398
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:08,470
of Nana that's my perception at least

1399
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:10,210
I'll just add to that with my perception

1400
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:12,779
this is just me but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> much rather</font>

1401
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:16,150
be doing this now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

1402
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:18,070
relatively calm and at peace than trying

1403
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:19,450
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a time of turmoil when</font>

1404
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,220
there are many other things going<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font>

1405
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:23,710
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry about if we had</font>

1406
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:26,589
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this during the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transition</font>

1407
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:31,800
back in 2005 was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think would have</font>

1408
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:31,799
been much harder sure

1409
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,029
I

1410
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:41,308
you guys have in the answers have talked

1411
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:44,130
a lot about what's happened in the past

1412
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:45,719
in terms of the management<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nanog in</font>

1413
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:47,309
them and the meetings themselves I'm

1414
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:48,929
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what are the</font>

1415
01:03:47,309 --> 01:03:50,989
changes that you guys are looking to do

1416
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:54,359
in the new nog that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1417
01:03:50,989 --> 01:03:57,209
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make all this work worth it what's</font>

1418
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:59,369
the payoff besides you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1419
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:01,198
freedom to do exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want how</font>

1420
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:03,779
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is payoff</font>

1421
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:06,599
in and of itself it does give us down

1422
01:04:03,779 --> 01:04:09,689
the road flexibility to experiment with

1423
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:11,130
new sponsorship models some people have

1424
01:04:09,689 --> 01:04:13,618
proposed changing number of meetings in

1425
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:16,289
a year it gives us the opportunity to

1426
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:21,029
expand it to areas that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

1427
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:24,390
currently in like the document tracks

1428
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:26,849
are that sort of thing I believe that's

1429
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:29,729
that's the flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> short term the</font>

1430
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:31,169
goal is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> break things and at that</font>

1431
01:04:29,729 --> 01:04:33,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I don't want to be flippant about</font>

1432
01:04:31,169 --> 01:04:35,969
that that is a very important thing if

1433
01:04:33,149 --> 01:04:37,618
we create the opportunity to build all

1434
01:04:35,969 --> 01:04:40,499
this new stuff while destroying what's

1435
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:42,179
here now we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing our jobs so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1436
01:04:40,499 --> 01:04:44,638
need to focus a lot on not breaking

1437
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:45,869
things that's a big piece of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

1438
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:47,069
to be done in that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> all going</font>

1439
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:51,509
to be focusing most of our energy on

1440
01:04:47,069 --> 01:04:55,229
with the next year so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Benny know so</font>

1441
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:57,389
Vijay kill so<font color="#CCCCCC"> why I grieve it Randy that</font>

1442
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:58,979
basically we trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys we are your</font>

1443
01:04:57,389 --> 01:05:01,169
elected members please go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1444
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:03,448
execute as you see fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you don't</font>

1445
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:05,819
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we vote you out and we shouldn't</font>

1446
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:08,309
debate this much in and take up more

1447
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:10,319
operational time debating this what I

1448
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:12,899
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I think would make life much</font>

1449
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:15,239
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me and from I'm zoom for</font>

1450
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:16,288
other people is whenever I go up and say

1451
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:17,519
I need a couple of hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> million</font>

1452
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:19,349
dollars because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this or</font>

1453
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:21,988
that they say he what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your base</font>

1454
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:23,880
structural assumptions that you ask are

1455
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:26,699
asking for that say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

1456
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually worth spending and then what</font>

1457
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:31,439
they ask for is perturb the base

1458
01:05:28,979 --> 01:05:33,388
assumptions so its sensitivity analysis

1459
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:36,178
like what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attendance goes to 300</font>

1460
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:38,609
how long can<font color="#E5E5E5"> new nog continue to operate</font>

1461
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:41,189
what if the tendons it works really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1462
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:43,529
the tendons goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 what what are</font>

1463
01:05:41,189 --> 01:05:44,939
the future plans for the kind of money

1464
01:05:43,529 --> 01:05:46,619
that comes in at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do</font>

1465
01:05:44,939 --> 01:05:48,710
that kind of sensitivity analysis on and

1466
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:50,330
post it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we are pretty much good</font>

1467
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:55,700
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should stop discussing</font>

1468
01:05:50,330 --> 01:06:05,900
this anymore many people want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to touch</font>

1469
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:08,839
anything okay Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> busia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AJ I was on</font>

1470
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:13,880
the first steering committee um this has

1471
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:16,880
been happening for a long time the

1472
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:22,940
question I would ask is why wasn't done

1473
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:26,690
soon to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of I think</font>

1474
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:30,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">daniel said it the real basis is Merritt</font>

1475
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:33,440
has their goals they are good goals

1476
01:06:30,339 --> 01:06:35,570
admirable merit does a good job for the

1477
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,410
state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan educational world etc</font>

1478
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:43,780
etc those aren't the goals of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana</font>

1479
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:47,660
community they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in conflict</font>

1480
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:51,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I would you know when I went to</font>

1481
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:54,799
boiling point was when an analog meeting

1482
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:58,730
was scheduled in direct conflict with an

1483
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:00,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">r ir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and other regional nod meeting that</font>

1484
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:03,970
half the steering committee had to go to

1485
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:08,780
and it was scheduled that way to avoid a

1486
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:11,509
merit internal meeting our external

1487
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:13,970
meeting with their memberships and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

1488
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:16,510
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why merit did that but there</font>

1489
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:19,790
was no ability to discuss and negotiate

1490
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:22,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but to take the second half of you</font>

1491
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:24,800
and and that's no blame on merit and no

1492
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:28,540
blame on that ugh that's what happens

1493
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you know the goals are different</font>

1494
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:35,390
the second part of your question I think

1495
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:38,119
is worthwhile though what will change I

1496
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:40,490
think of course the people up there are

1497
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:43,010
very worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about breaking things but</font>

1498
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:45,618
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that really should be</font>

1499
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:47,900
changing and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on and one of</font>

1500
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:51,800
them kind of pokes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vijay's question</font>

1501
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:54,920
about you know sensitivity analysis of

1502
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:58,650
finances we've continually scheduled

1503
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:01,140
meetings based on finding some random

1504
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">most and we end up in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wonderful cities</font>

1505
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:06,569
like Albuquerque and not very many

1506
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:10,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">people come and we hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in San</font>

1507
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:14,160
Francisco and wow we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just surprised</font>

1508
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:16,229
we have so many attendees<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow I mean</font>

1509
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,120
it's like I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a v6 meeting last</font>

1510
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:20,939
week and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out we're running out</font>

1511
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:27,090
of ipv4 space it's an absolute shocker

1512
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:29,849
um so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways we can change</font>

1513
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:31,980
things when our goals are in that that's

1514
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:33,780
just one example and I don't want to

1515
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:36,569
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a bunch because all it does is</font>

1516
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:38,729
bring up bad blood about the way things

1517
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:41,309
have been running decisions but I think

1518
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:44,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are significant ways that we can</font>

1519
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:48,540
evolve and change on how we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

1520
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:50,670
the organization and and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1521
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:52,769
clear I<font color="#E5E5E5"> set it on list but I should say</font>

1522
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:56,520
it here I think membership plus

1523
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:58,350
attendance model is I mean I can name

1524
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:05,400
the number of organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do it</font>

1525
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:07,650
that way you know um to go back to what

1526
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:10,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vijay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said earlier by the way facility</font>

1527
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:11,639
and other people I forget whom sorry

1528
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,350
have actually put together a budget that

1529
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,600
we will be presenting tomorrow which

1530
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:17,280
allows you to perturb the<font color="#CCCCCC"> basis and look</font>

1531
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,160
at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens if something goes wrong</font>

1532
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">if the membership goes down it's etc so</font>

1533
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there this was</font>

1534
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:25,649
mostly to give you guys a preview the

1535
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:29,549
baath tomorrow we'll have much more in

1536
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:31,049
depth detailed information by the way in

1537
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:33,029
terms of future things that people have

1538
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:35,700
suggested and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying I like any</font>

1539
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:37,439
of these because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them I like and</font>

1540
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,429
some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like but things</font>

1541
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,049
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggested like on the</font>

1542
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:42,240
nanog futures list and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in the</font>

1543
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:44,730
halls I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people should brainstorm</font>

1544
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:48,809
this and try to think of more things one

1545
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:50,639
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCPs another was doing more</font>

1546
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:53,400
professional development stuff another

1547
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:56,790
was more sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a common core network</font>

1548
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:57,870
engineering education I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's</font>

1549
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:59,400
probably five or ten more things that

1550
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would think of I think these guys</font>

1551
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,280
are concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with not breaking anything</font>

1552
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:04,200
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition but I think a lot</font>

1553
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people out here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be thinking</font>

1554
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,490
about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in a year or two when</font>

1555
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:10,110
this transition is fully done and

1556
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:13,110
nothing is broken

1557
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:14,639
and you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would like to</font>

1558
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:16,110
see and if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to see it</font>

1559
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:18,060
maybe they should start<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on it I</font>

1560
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:19,080
I certainly think that we shouldn't wait

1561
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,330
for the steering committee but if

1562
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:24,239
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to start a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp working</font>

1563
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:27,780
group or someone wants to start you know

1564
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:30,629
a a network engineer Corps education

1565
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group or whatever you know</font>

1566
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:33,840
people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stand up and say</font>

1567
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:35,550
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1568
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,980
recruit people and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1569
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:40,020
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> once we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got our own</font>

1570
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:45,500
organization all of that stuff becomes a

1571
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:45,500
possibility and interestingly

1572
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:55,260
interestingly I got a text message with

1573
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">a new comment you people are impressive</font>

1574
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:59,340
I don't even know who did it because

1575
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,809
apparently that number is not my address

1576
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:04,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">book so you might want to tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

1577
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:05,639
you are but it is a reminder that and

1578
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steve said this earlier but a reminder</font>

1579
01:11:05,639 --> 01:11:08,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who just come to the</font>

1580
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,590
meeting an hour on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mailing list if</font>

1581
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:11,759
they're not involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in down our futures</font>

1582
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:13,949
if they don't come to the community

1583
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,080
meeting if they just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> show up</font>

1584
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:17,519
and go to the plenary they shouldn't

1585
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,900
notice anything happen this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1586
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a no op or at least that's the plan</font>

1587
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,679
you're just going to show up<font color="#CCCCCC"> next year</font>

1588
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,730
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still going to be nanog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

1589
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:25,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look just like it was before</font>

1590
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:27,659
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said or at least that's the plan</font>

1591
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:29,219
if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that to be different than</font>

1592
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:30,540
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> go join one of the working</font>

1593
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:39,659
groups and see what you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do to change</font>

1594
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:41,610
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> Leo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bicknell is see you know I</font>

1595
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:44,369
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is largely a natural</font>

1596
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:48,000
progression and I think part of the

1597
01:11:44,369 --> 01:11:50,790
answer to why now is you have to have

1598
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,880
people in place who want to make it

1599
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:57,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen and so if we have that now that</font>

1600
01:11:53,880 --> 01:12:00,360
makes it the right time I do think my

1601
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:03,750
concern is is kind of similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1602
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:06,330
Vijay articulated while I don't follow

1603
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:10,199
this in great detail I've heard stories

1604
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:11,699
of meetings gone by where various things

1605
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:14,388
have gone wrong and ended up costing

1606
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:16,789
lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of money</font>

1607
01:12:14,389 --> 01:12:18,349
and you know unbalanced over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years I</font>

1608
01:12:16,789 --> 01:12:21,110
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now mode loses money but</font>

1609
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:22,849
certainly on any individual meeting it

1610
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:26,719
could possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in the red quite badly</font>

1611
01:12:22,849 --> 01:12:28,219
and so my worry in setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a new</font>

1612
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,639
organization is it dies a young

1613
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:33,229
embryonic death because you know we pick

1614
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:34,939
a meeting location in six months later

1615
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:37,340
there's an earthquake in<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Francisco</font>

1616
01:12:34,939 --> 01:12:38,659
falls in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bay or BP spills oil or</font>

1617
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:43,579
whatever happens outside of our control

1618
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:47,299
and I haven't seen yet a lot of planning

1619
01:12:43,579 --> 01:12:48,889
or reassurances for sort of you know the

1620
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,300
really bad things that can happen and I

1621
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:53,059
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's more coming out tomorrow</font>

1622
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:55,070
in the ball but to be truly supportive

1623
01:12:53,059 --> 01:12:57,679
of it that's that's the piece that that

1624
01:12:55,070 --> 01:13:00,530
I feel I need more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information on for</font>

1625
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:04,010
four events that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> four events</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1626
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:06,349
are truly outside our control most there

1627
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:08,389
are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like conference cancellation</font>

1628
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:09,919
insurance which usually run fairly cheap

1629
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:12,800
it's like one buck on a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> bucks</font>

1630
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:15,079
per outlay sure that those are those are

1631
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,789
folded into the budget absolutely and I

1632
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:18,739
think I'm more concerned about I no

1633
01:13:16,789 --> 01:13:20,268
instances before<font color="#E5E5E5"> where nanog has ended</font>

1634
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:23,119
up costing you know 50 grand more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

1635
01:13:20,269 --> 01:13:25,459
anybody budgeted because whatever XYZ

1636
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:27,259
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs money and stuff but you</font>

1637
01:13:25,459 --> 01:13:28,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">know when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have a reserve one</font>

1638
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:33,050
of the nice things merit brings right

1639
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:34,429
now is they have a reserve and we keep

1640
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about you know as we plan</font>

1641
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:37,760
further out the liability gets bigger

1642
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:40,130
right we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got three hotels out booked</font>

1643
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,389
instead of one or whatever so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1644
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:44,059
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a concern where I</font>

1645
01:13:41,389 --> 01:13:49,010
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a little more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to really on</font>

1646
01:13:44,059 --> 01:13:50,749
board with the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> concept two things</font>

1657
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:32,810
to say as an outsider his viewpoint is

1658
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:34,580
that independence is the payoff and that

1659
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:37,040
we oughtn't be looking back<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1663
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:48,830
is to look forward and work on structure

1664
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:52,639

Michael personal goal out of all of this

1686
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:59,540

1694
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:16,929
but that's an example of that going down

1695
