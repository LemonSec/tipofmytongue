1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,639
anyway to get things started off today

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,250
we're going to be getting a talk on the

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">heart of what makes routers route these</font>

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,140
days the asic from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shanghai ooh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,140
juniper networks

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,720
whoops

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,140
Oh for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the surprise him a little bit</font>

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,120
we're running where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> my announcements</font>

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,500
didn't last 15 minutes I don't know how

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">why when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we put together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the agenda we</font>

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,490
thought I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk for 15</font>

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,470
minutes I could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I don't want</font>

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,700
to bore you to tears so we're actually

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,470
going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> started a little early</font>

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,720
somehow I have a feeling we'll manage to

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:01:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">lose it all before we get to lunchtime</font>

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:11,030
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the slice up</font>

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,030
somehow watching that

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,820
thanks good

21
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:33,610
and good morning it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be here</font>

22
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:36,860
today so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six and it is not</font>

23
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:39,140
usual that that we come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk to</font>

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">this many people so in a corporate</font>

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,560
hierarchy we are usually hiding behind

26
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:47,960
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sales support software and</font>

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,409
hardware then we are the inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,600
routers so I really appreciate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana</font>

29
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:56,479
program committee that giving me this

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,649
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> share our work today so</font>

31
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,500
hopefully through this you get some

32
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:05,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">understanding of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we designed the</font>

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,759
heart of the routers and and then we can

34
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,699
also through some dialogue and service

35
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:18,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">our catalyst so that we can better serve</font>

36
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:21,709
your needs in the future so everybody

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,420
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us are aware of the exponential</font>

38
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,470
growth of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last</font>

39
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:30,320
like 15 10 15 years no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font>

40
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:36,109
measure it on this graph that shows a

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of measurements that people take the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is ticking eight is potential</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">path for growth no matter how you</font>

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:49,880
measure it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't come this come</font>

45
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,040
come about myself of course we are

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,690
delivering value to our end customer

47
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,090
that's why it grows what is the

48
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,280
fundamental in what is the driving force

49
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:05,480
behind all this exponential growth of

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,049
the way we see it are the interaction of

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,018
the computing and the networking and the

52
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:18,470
storage elements inside an information

53
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:20,150
system right so for themselves by

54
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,579
themselves be computing and networking

55
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,100
and storage all grow by themselves over

56
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:27,739
time but is the interaction and the

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,660
ability we connect them together that

58
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,880
make this information system<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

59
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,460
valuable to our customers and that's

60
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,430
what is driving

61
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:39,330
the growth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more valuable the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,820
total package and it also makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

63
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,070
individual components<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow faster and is</font>

64
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:50,140
this positive feedback that tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

65
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:53,579
charge the exponential growth that is

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,170
driving force but what is behind this

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,190
exponential growth in the last several

68
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,890
decades are the improvements in silicon

69
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,200
integrated circuits and here on this

70
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,049
diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are showing the commons</font>

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:15,339
improvement of a computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> system in the</font>

72
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:17,829
last 20 years also you can see it it's

73
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,459
the system itself is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like</font>

74
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:24,550
two times a year and the microprocessor

75
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,969
is self is growing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 100 one and</font>

76
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,450
a half times a year 1.3<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see</font>

77
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system itself is growing faster than</font>

78
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,090
individual components and that shows the

79
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,190
value of the interconnect and<font color="#CCCCCC"> an even</font>

80
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,090
inside a computer system there is a

81
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">network or sometime in some some sort of</font>

82
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:51,030
interconnect and connects the components

83
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:53,530
together and more relevant to this talk

84
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,950
we're showing the router performance

85
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,830
improvement in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years and we</font>

86
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:03,120
are showing there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two phases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

87
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">development of the routers and one is</font>

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,960
before the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> to late 90s that's</font>

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,170
before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a6 are widely used in routers</font>

90
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,450
and the improvement of the routers are

91
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,270
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.6 times a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

92
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,039
roughly consistent with what computer

93
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,060
system will give you and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

94
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,970
surprising because at those days the

95
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,510
routers are made from computer systems

96
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,970
right but after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Asics become widely</font>

97
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:38,110

98
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">enrolling systems the improvement the</font>

99
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,129
pace of<font color="#CCCCCC"> improvement is increased</font>

100
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,709
dramatically

101
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:46,919
and as you can see here are several

102
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:50,909
example of what juniper of systems

103
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:53,459
delivers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure this is true it is</font>

104
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:57,269
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general as a whole and in the post</font>

105
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:59,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">ASIC error</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but in the router systems are</font>

106
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:02,610
improved at a rate of about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two points</font>

107
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">two times a year I mean you can the top</font>

108
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,559
12 against 1.6 or is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big number to</font>

109
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,919
start with but if you do that year after

110
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:13,319
year and this will make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

111
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,438
big number you can see there's a million

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,229
times of growth of router<font color="#CCCCCC"> performance is</font>

113
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,059
20 years if in a large part of it is

114
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:32,179
because of the use of a sex in the later

115
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:32,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">part of the ten years of the 20 years so</font>

116
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:40,289
where we can see the role of the asics

117
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:42,389
in in a router performance improvement

118
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:46,318
and now we take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how we</font>

119
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:48,839
categorize the use of silicon inside a

120
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,899
communication system and then we

121
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,199
classify them based on how much

122
00:06:51,899 --> 00:07:00,679
information they process so here the

123
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:05,399
instruction is a kind of abstract thing

124
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:08,248
abstract a measure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much the</font>

125
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,699
system treats the packets or the

126
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:13,979
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from the left which has</font>

127
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,719
less processing per packet and to all

128
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,240
the way to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right is more processing</font>

129
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:20,879
for packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> which requires a classified</font>

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,579
them as traffic engine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> core engine</font>

131
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:28,169
and edge engine and service engine asics

132
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:31,079
play an important role in almost all of

133
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:33,839
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> categories and each a cig system</font>

135
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,099
of these categories you can play

136
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:41,308
multiple of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> categories in fact</font>

137
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:44,429
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the innovation are driven off</font>

138
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:47,059
that that one can produce can give

139
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:49,859
advantages in several different

140
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:53,889
categories

141
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:57,460
and here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another way to look at the</font>

142
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:59,679
comparison I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about a six I never</font>

143
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,229
explain what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means ASIC is an</font>

144
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:04,830
acronym that extends for

145
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:08,378
application-specific integrated circuit

146
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:12,909
by its meaning by its definition it's

147
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:16,179
specifically designed for your task so

148
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:20,219
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the few types of devices we use</font>

00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:23,888
in building routers or coming or

150
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:25,830
communication system in general and they

151
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:29,889
all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their advantages and</font>

152
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:34,539
disadvantages and for the right uses

153
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:37,329
case they could be the right answer one

154
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,029
the first one we look at in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

155
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:43,088
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> general-purpose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs and these</font>

156
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,920
are widely available<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of them</font>

157
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,860
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they're very flexible</font>

158
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,410
because they are programmable devices

159
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,170
they can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything you want but these</font>

160
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,509
advantages it in routing systems are

161
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,920
they are not as good in performance

162
00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:04,389
density and power<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the case that it</font>

163
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,729
it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right answer are for the in</font>

164
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,740
cases where flexibility is more

165
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,639
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> than performance and most most</font>

166
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,579
of the cases are the low end routers and

167
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:19,259
we see them a lot in even in commercial

168
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:22,329
systems and then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one down</font>

169
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:27,089
economy you programmable gate arrays or

170
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:29,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">fpgas and these are devices that is</font>

171
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:33,009
already built but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can program them</font>

172
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:37,120
at run time to do the logic function

173
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:40,120
that you design and advantages course

174
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,949
they are compared with<font color="#CCCCCC"> asics which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

175
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,680
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a little bit later there</font>

176
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:46,329
are small upfront development costs

177
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,609
because these devices are already there

178
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:50,680
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also they are upgradeable on the</font>

179
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,740
field after you develop up to do you

180
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,839
develop it and the disadvantages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

181
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,899
course is they they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lower</font>

182
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,920
performance intensity and power 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> a-6</font>

183
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:06,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they are also hired for</font>

184
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:10,000
and the cases these are usable are

185
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,340
useful and probably even Avant ages are

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,330
when a volume is low because the price

187
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:22,570
is high and when changes i expect it so

188
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,520
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if one of the standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

189
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,100
you are designed to is not finalized and

190
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,750
you can use this so you can upgrade them

191
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:33,010
when it when the standard is finalized

192
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:36,850
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful and the third category</font>

193
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:39,970
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we cut across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in is the network</font>

194
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,150
processor now these are flexible devices

195
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:46,480
and they already<font color="#CCCCCC"> made you can jump</font>

196
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">straight in the software design so</font>

197
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,390
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantages but sometimes they</font>

198
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not specific design for your tasks</font>

199
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,699
you have a compromise their performance

200
00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:00,820
power and functionality targets but of

201
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,470
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are useful situations as</font>

202
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,720
well when the hard way differentiation

203
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,850
is not that important<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can</font>

204
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,680
differentiate with software and but of

205
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,180
course I mean depends on how they are

206
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed there are some feature you can</font>

207
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,670
may or may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to deliver with</font>

208
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:19,120
the devices already there in the last

209
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:21,069
one we can see are those are the exact

210
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,400
application specific integrated circuits

211
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:28,630
and they are tailored<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

212
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:31,060
specification that's the advantage they

213
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,640
are high performance and comparable a

214
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:38,170
low production costs but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

215
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:40,120
disadvantages are also there they have

216
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:44,439
high upfront costs in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute I will</font>

217
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:48,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you we need to pay a very high call</font>

218
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:51,010
nie cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> or non-recurring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering</font>

219
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,660
costs when we develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> these devices and</font>

220
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,689
they also have very long development

221
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,370
cycles but they are high performance and

222
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,220
they're low performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs and you</font>

223
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:03,840
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> escape from them if you design</font>

224
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,840
has high performance routers

225
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:16,279
now we can see I've talked about the

226
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:19,670
rows of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics play in routers now I</font>

227
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:23,930
will turn my attention to see how we

228
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:28,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed them and we start with system</font>

229
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:32,660
architecture at first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

230
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,610
anything that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> design need to meet the</font>

231
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,160
market requirements in performance

232
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:42,019
density and feature and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and then we</font>

233
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,209
we look at it from from a lot of angles

234
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,500
one is a software hardware partitioning

235
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:50,060
and how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the of the function are</font>

236
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,860
done by hardware and how much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is</font>

237
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,869
done by software<font color="#E5E5E5"> or how much of them is</font>

238
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,269
done by both interacting with each other

239
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,279
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact most of the things we do are the</font>

240
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:02,740
interaction between software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

241
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:05,390
hardware in the router systems and we do

242
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,899
silicon fabrication process technology

243
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,850
evaluations and I have another slide

244
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:14,480
talk about more details but that's the

245
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:19,070
cost performance trade-off we do and a

246
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,290
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important aspect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of designing asics</font>

247
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:25,250
in routers are the choice of memories

248
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:27,410
and we use memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working buffers</font>

249
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,240

250
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,969
management and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the store</font>

251
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,970
configurations and the forwarding tables

252
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,910
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> access control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lists and all of</font>

253
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:41,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and the choice of routers plays a</font>

254
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:45,140
very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> role in determining your</font>

255
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:47,750
feature and and the cause of this

256
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,480
finished system and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also look at</font>

257
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:53,029
chip partitioning and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

258
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,339
sure the petitioning makes sense in

259
00:13:53,029 --> 00:14:01,220
terms of featured performance and cost

260
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:04,220
targets the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect the fabrication</font>

261
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,839
technologies and one thing about silicon

262
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:11,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">processes like they improve over time</font>

263
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,660
remarkably and then a greater density of

264
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:17,089
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> processes can put more case on the</font>

265
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,390
same device area<font color="#E5E5E5"> which will give you</font>

266
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:22,140
more function in

267
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:25,620
and there's a Moore's law that has been

268
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:29,000
existing for quite a while and which was

269
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,620
proposed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel's founder Gordon Moore</font>

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,810
the transistor density transistor

271
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:39,600
density doubles every 18 months and

272
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,949
people has been talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> death</font>

273
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,650
of that law for a long time but

274
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">remarkably it has been holding up very</font>

275
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:50,730
very well it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going pretty</font>

276
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:53,969
strong but how long can it last we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

277
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:56,310

278
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,610
get that get that scaling but thankfully

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:05,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are still there so we should be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago the scaling of this</font>

00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:17,880
you advantages not only in density by in

284
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,130
power in performance in everything but

285
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:24,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has recently changed in the last</font>

288
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,300
a performance is starting the level of

289
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,940
and also the decrease in operation

290
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,630
voltage which comes every generation has

291
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,580
also slowed down quite a bit the reason

292
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are which we are</font>

293

and on the other hand the static power

304
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,200
mainly due to leakage and increase

305

346

there's congestion and then the packets

00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:32,259
are usually segmented into fix ourselves

348

and they need to be linked together

349

that's the memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show on the rice I</font>

fundamentally they are the linguists and

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the link memories are</font>

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:11,520
they will show you they will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

with which entry it matches<font color="#CCCCCC"> the content</font>

and they have much much higher power and

435
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,740
because there are not many vendors are

436

to design a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular feature so forth</font>

440
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:09,490
if the if the memories are smaller if

441
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:12,060
you design to hold a fifth table for

442
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,770
example the forwarding table it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font>

443
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:17,169
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> as many entry the scaling will</font>

446
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:27,220
you also may face the same problem so

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:30,100
the scalability the feature and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at the end is very very much influenced</font>

449
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:36,699

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing that these memories are</font>

451

also silicon devices they follow the

most law<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and so they are changed</font>

453

467
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:30,129
but since the processor the

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,250
microprocessor vendors decide to put the

475

have to predict and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,570
in a few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> because all these ASIC</font>

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:16,150
and to decide which one to pick so here

483
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:18,610
again are the three types of the memory

484
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show in the previous diagram and</font>

485
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:24,639
a few of the NC gives you a few examples

486
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,280
of how how that is done when is the

487
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,440
packet buffers for<font color="#CCCCCC"> high performance</font>

488
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet buffers you need high throughput</font>

489
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,860
in high density because on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Y area</font>

490
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,070
routers for congestion management

491
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:44,429
purpose we need hundreds of milliseconds

492
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:47,470
of buffers and that usually translate to

493
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:50,470
external memories and then that's why we

494
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:53,050
use sdram external STM for those

495
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:57,310
emotional time and sometimes because sqm

496
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:59,020
performance is not up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> par we use them</font>

497
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,940
a little bit higher performance at that

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,830
time the aisle drm folder for that

499
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,200
purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can use the</font>

500
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,810
ramble that is that the packets are

501
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,620
usually pretty long so high long bursts

502
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:13,929
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay on the other hand for the cue</font>

503
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Link memories they also need high</font>

504
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,720
performance high throughput but they

505
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,309
need low latency because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the next link before</font>

509
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:34,149
latency and shorter first so so we need

510
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,679
some of the example we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SRAM</font>

because<font color="#CCCCCC"> their lower latency but the ad</font>

their size is limited so we do a lot of

tricks to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> gear m2 u2 2444 this link</font>

516
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,639
characteristics are slightly different

517
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,820
and the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> category are is the</font>

these are these are small<font color="#CCCCCC"> quantum's</font>

522
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:12,039
because they are control information we

00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:16,570
need them a little bit at a time so

524

forth for that the SRAM and<font color="#E5E5E5"> key cam and</font>

theorems for for that purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i will</font>

527
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,580
give us some specific example of how

00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:40,649

534
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:58,240
is that fewer chip does not necessarily

mean overall lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs that's because</font>

584
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:45,720
believe and and the lower platforms they

585
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,699
are fabricated using 250 nanometer

586
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,130
process and therefore chips in each

587
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,710
chipset and the reason we split those

588
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">four chips are mainly due to the system</font>

589
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:01,240
partitioning and the memory we use for

590

<font color="#E5E5E5">the control memory we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> srams at that</font>

591
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:08,230
time 125 megahertz only and use STM's

592
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:11,110
those are the single data rate sdram 125

593
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:15,010
makers as well so those those are long

594
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:18,580
time ago and then we did a internet

595
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:21,760
process three in a release in about 2002

596
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:24,939
and those are fabricated using 180

597
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,400
nanometer process and how in the

<font color="#CCCCCC">parentheses are the 90 you I'll talk</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">FES and the main reason to speed the</font>

602
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:44,860
chips in that case was memory bandwidth

these chips are interface to memories

00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:56,260
data memories and curing memories and in

606
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:59,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we use SRAM as a control</font>

607
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:03,040

608
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:06,610
bus thing so we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rambis as the data</font>

609
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:12,899
memory at that time and that's the only

<font color="#E5E5E5">time we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> renders memory and later on</font>

611
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:19,780
we extend this one too so the original

612
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,880
chip was designed 4640 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extend it</font>

613
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:27,100
with double the performance to teach

614
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,900
1600 and then we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that chipset in 90</font>

615
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,840
nanometer

616
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:35,190
and that was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine chip complex one of</font>

617
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,320
the interface should we combine them

618
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,920
together because we were like two

619
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:44,220
generation ahead at that time we still

620
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,650
use SRAM as a control memory and we

621
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:54,270
switched or I'll drm the reduced latency

622
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:57,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">irin as the packet memory and because we</font>

623
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,190
look at ddr sdram at that time was

624
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,960
immature to the point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

625
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:05,870
performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> par so at that</font>

626
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,670
time I'll DRM is the best we can reuse

627
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the funny thing about the SRAM also is</font>

628
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:13,560
like we designed the tivo 16 version of

629
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,440
it right in the middle of the project

630
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:20,399
that SRAM actually disappear from our

631
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:23,910
vendors row map so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to improvise</font>

632
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,090
so you can see so with all the planning

633
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:32,520
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do there's always some catch</font>

634
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:34,530
there so later on in 2006 we<font color="#E5E5E5"> released</font>

635
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,870
the eye chip which is a one chip pancake

636
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:42,590
PFE and that was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed using a</font>

637
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:46,020
90 nanometer process and it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

638
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:48,689
we switch the aisle drm as our control

639
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,700
to reduce latency hear em as our control

640
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:57,270
memory mainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we are for seeing</font>

641
00:33:50,700 --> 00:34:00,960
the SRAM they<font color="#E5E5E5"> d as i talk before the</font>

642
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:03,180
SRAM improvement SRAM cannot slow down

643
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,600
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll do give give us much</font>

644
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:11,820
better size because it's a theorem so we

645
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:15,120
can provide more scalability to to to

646
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:19,950
you guys and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then for packet memory we</font>

647
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:22,710
use ddr2 sdram and then last year we

648
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:25,589
release a new chipset called trio also

649
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:29,340
sometimes called n is p network

650
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:32,280
instruction set processor we use we

651
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,620
design it using 65 nanometer process

652
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,330
which is an improvement over 90 the next

653
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:41,230
generation well actually to love the

654
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:43,270
chips are used used 65 200 ships use 90

655
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,460
and you can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of transistor</font>

656
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:48,159
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> increase dramatically so that's the</font>

657
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:51,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">power of the most law and in this case</font>

658
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,389
we kept I'll dram as a control and ddr3

659
00:34:51,510 --> 00:35:00,220
sdram and your next generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of memory</font>

660
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:04,390
for follower for our data process of the

661
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:06,549
data packets so<font color="#E5E5E5"> while all why are we</font>

662
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:10,690
changing all of these from time to time

663
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:13,510
right so course is to provide value to

664
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,640
our customers and you can see these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

665
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:22,180
not the same system so it's don't look

666
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:23,970
at the same column as before so they

667
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:29,500
don't corresponding to the previous page

668
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:31,959
but anyway they<font color="#CCCCCC"> d with time from 1998 to</font>

669
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,630
2007 we have for generational core

670
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,030
routers and then because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of improvement</font>

671
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:39,430
in silicon technology and of course a

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,369
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things as well and all the</font>

674
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:50,170
improved while we decrease power for

power of<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic improvements</font>

681
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:19,279
now we can we are done with architecture

682
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:25,098
face now it's time to sit down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

683
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:27,319
the design ourselves right so so so we

684
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:29,329
we decide the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trip petitioning we design</font>

685
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:33,410
a memory we to use we decide everything

686
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:35,420
and now people human beings design

687
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,920
things by divide and conquer because

688
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,170
that's the only way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know we don't</font>

689
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to do too complex of thing so</font>

690
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">with design is we divided the system to</font>

691
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:47,720
its individual chips and now we just

692
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,430
divide the chips into sub systems in sub

693

695
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:58,640
the basic logic elements and in this

00:36:54,799 --> 00:37:03,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">phase we document these functionalities</font>

697
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,779
and and the main criteria we use our

00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:09,079
peer reviews and with some of the

701
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:17,390
diagram the right you you split the chip

00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:19,039
in the input and output and input<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

two functions and one of the functions

are both control and data path you

705
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:28,910
design them separately and see what the

706
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:30,759
logic is inside each and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font>

707
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,769
translate the micro architect

708

microarchitecture into register transfer

709
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:45,709
level language or we call RTL so on a

710
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:47,359
diagram you imagine and logic element

711
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,619
and you translate into something on the

712
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,788
right there are two way or coding them

713
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:54,410
when is on the top the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way is the</font>

714
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:56,119
bottom the top one probably doesn't look

715
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,670
like see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much in the bottom one</font>

716
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,930
that assigned how<font color="#E5E5E5"> equalist select looks</font>

717
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:05,119
exactly like see right so yeah these are

718
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:09,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we spend the most time doing this</font>

719
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:12,140
these are the functional designs and we

720
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:16,039
translate the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything into this</font>

721
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:18,830
RTL code an inner last chip will have

722
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:21,710
hundreds of thousands of lines of these

723
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:24,529
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that statistic might be a little</font>

725
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:29,720
two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the other thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

726
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,940
although they<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like see they are not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">software they will get translate into</font>

728
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,230
hardware they will have devices

729
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,730
corresponding to them so that's

730
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,830
something that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

731
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:44,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we when we write these CLI RTL</font>

732
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:47,390
codes if you don't do that because

733
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:50,240
things are spread out and you take a lot

734
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">of gates and the performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will go</font>

735
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,209
down you have to modify your design so

736
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,580
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> one very very different</font>

737
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:01,460
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> a prominent example compared</font>

738
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:04,279
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> C and the hard way are like shift</font>

739
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:08,120
registers are very cheap in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware</font>

740
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:14,890
because you just wire them differently

741
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:14,890
there's no logic involved right so but a

742
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:22,820
shift a barrel shifter it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is easy in</font>

743
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,880

744
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,490
because it it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mock software</font>

745
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,020
and multiplex over many many bits so

746
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:33,200
that that's one example I will likely

747
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:38,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so keep in mind those are hot where</font>

748
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:43,640

749
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:47,650
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a step we move the RTL the</font>

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if you want to use the equivalent</font>

specification of what clock frequency

759
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:19,970
then that the the tool will translate

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,530
called physical synthesis while we

777
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:15,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this hundreds of thousands of</font>

00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,930
lines of code how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

779
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:21,319
correct and then we do your ification on

780
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:23,210
them and the goal of course is to do to

781
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,330
be able to achieve first time correct

782
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,730
silicon because a degree spin we have to

783
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:32,810
pay the NIE that several million dollar

784
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:36,340

785
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:39,380
lasik so we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

786
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:42,080
also simulations<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot easier to</font>

787
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,690
debug and real chips look at a real chip

788
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:51,350
you cannot see anything all you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

789
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:53,180
is that it doesn't work so simulation

790
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,040
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see the internal value</font>

791
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,779
internal signals and everything so it's

792
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,090
a lot easier to debug where you can see

793
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problems so the recipe we have</font>

794
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:03,470
insight to provide us least as many

795
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,900
verification and engineers as design

796
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:09,620
engineers and in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> day of probably</font>

797
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:11,570
that need to be more and we perform the

00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,549
verifications at multiple levels at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,810
subsystem level at a system level and

801
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:21,230
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we perform software and hardware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co</font>

802
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:22,759
simulations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's so that the</font>

803
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,680
software can work together with the

804
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,350
hardware before the hardware is

805
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,500
available and the tools we use there's

806
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:34,730
there's a lot of we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> C C++ to do that</font>

807
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,590
then system verilog and very long people

808
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:39,020
use that as well we use coverage tools

809
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,480
to make sure that we cover every line of

810
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,970
code

811
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,420
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use equivalency checkers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

812
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:47,279
check between the eight the this the

00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine languages which is our RTL</font>

814
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,210
languages and then we use simulators you

815
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,859
use waveforms to look at the waveform so

816
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,590
that we can see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong when</font>

817
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:57,810
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work and there's also</font>

818
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,850
another aspect of it is after those

819
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">synthesized in the case we need to place</font>

820
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:06,720
them physically on the die and and we

821
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,390
just don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that randomly and we have</font>

822
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,609
to at these days especially the power in

823
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:14,790
a clock because the power of these chips

824
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:17,640
are so high and the voltage are so low

825
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:19,230
the currents are very very high so as

826
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,569
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the currents go through a</font>

827
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,570
resistor will cause a voltage drop and

828
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:28,020
we have to have a very good power and

829
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:31,380
network on the chip as well as honorable

830
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:33,090
to to make sure these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things work so we</font>

831
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,400
perform flow planning to see where the

832
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:37,950
logic should be placed and then we place

833
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,609
all the iOS input and output and all the

834
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:43,230
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> SRAM's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> die</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through that specific</font>

835
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:45,869
case and these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually done by hand</font>

836
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:48,119
not not by tools because we understand

837
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:52,170
how the logic flow is how to data flows

838
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:55,140
and all that and we place them by hand

839
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,180
and after that we place the we call a

840
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:00,960
random logic which are synthesized logic

841
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:03,690
by tools usually and then we perform

842
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,950
congestion analysis before we wire we

843
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:11,100
wire the wires up and then if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

844
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:14,609
work we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and then after</font>

845
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:19,140
we determine the placement is reasonable

846
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:21,480
enough we wire them up and then we of

847
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,060
course we run timing every step of the

848
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,970
way above and with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> frisch's physical</font>

resistance and the capacitance of the

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,140
wires or the physical wires and run

simulation timing<font color="#E5E5E5"> simulations with the</font>

854
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:44,069

<font color="#E5E5E5">frequency we desired and we do many many</font>

many of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iteration of the above</font>

857
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:54,839
and in fact why these basic development

00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:56,610
takes a few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is a main</font>

00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:32,040
iOS the<font color="#CCCCCC"> input/output elements and then</font>

868
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:35,880
here are all the gates placed and then

869
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:39,000
we wire them had a one-layer each layer

870
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,590
that metal won a medal to we usually

871
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,630
have multiple level layers and each

872
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:45,840
layer goes in one direction in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

873
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:48,390
layer will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> a perpendicular to that so</font>

874
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:52,140
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the m1 wiring metal one wiring</font>

875
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:56,118
and a metal to wiring<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle three</font>

876
00:45:52,140 --> 00:46:00,859
wiring horizontally metal for vertically

877
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:04,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">metal five horizontally again middle six</font>

878
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:05,790
vertically and that's the old days I

879
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:11,220
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is chip is probably six year</font>

880
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:14,210
old now we're up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle tenn and here</font>

881
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:20,490
is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the power routing</font>

882
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:24,200
and and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how difficult is to</font>

883
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:28,589
do this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then one day we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are done</font>

884
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:31,189
right so the criteria of what we call

885
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:33,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">tape hours are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we say ok we</font>

886
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:36,090
verified all the functionality we have

887
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:38,490
done and we verify them they all worked

888
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:43,290
to our best of our ability and

889
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:46,589
performance simulations and is that ok

890
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:49,529
that that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need we are there</font>

891
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:51,150
and chip is also araphi from a test

892
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,609
abilities perspective because these

893
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,740
chips are very complex devices and the

894
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:57,779
manufacturing there are defects and we

895
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,669
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to weed out those ones that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

896
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,059
defective so we have the design chester

897
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,979
has

898
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:04,859
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability logic in there to test the</font>

899
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:07,078
chips 2 and n chips also<font color="#E5E5E5"> mix timing and</font>

900
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:09,089
all the process temperature and voltage

901
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,549
conditions all these silicon devices

902
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:14,880
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what what is the temperature</font>

903
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:16,499
and everything they actually have

904
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,479
different timing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to work make</font>

905
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:20,848
sure they wallet all conditions and then

906
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:24,629
we archive all the databases and then we

907
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:27,469
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we take it out the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">mass house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would generate and mask</font>

909
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:34,559
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the design we do and this is</font>

910
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:36,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the main reason is a</font>

million-dollar ni es this is a these

912
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:43,619
masks are very very expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a</font>

00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:47,009
sex appeal on a layer by layer process

914
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:50,719
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom up to the top and then</font>

915
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:53,819
that takes a couple of months<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font>

916
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:56,549
once the asics wafers are complete and

917
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:58,380
then on the right side as a wafer

918
00:47:56,549 --> 00:48:00,538
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips on them and then</font>

919
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,779
they each thigh is tested on the way for

920
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:06,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they work and</font>

921
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:08,880
then when when they work you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will only</font>

922
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:10,709
cut out the working parts and put them

923
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,309
in the package those are the chips that

924
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:16,529
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see on if you ever by a cpu</font>

925
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:17,789
those are the chips<font color="#CCCCCC"> and after they cut</font>

926
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:21,719
that they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a tie and they are</font>

927
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:24,239
tested again on a package level and then

928
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:25,739
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chips and then we put them on</font>

929
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,959
the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we test them again</font>

930
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,489
with software and hardware they work

931
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:31,469
based they're designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with in</font>

932
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:34,709
any of day we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> prove them they woke</font>

933
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:36,839
them to be shipped under customers so

934
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:39,538
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pictures on the</font>

935
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:41,849
lower left that's the fat and all the

936
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:45,150
people wearing bunny suits in there on

937
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:47,119
the top left that's the wafer with

938
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:50,400
multiple chips on them on the top right

939
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,529
those are again a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross-section</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

940
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,880
in this case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are seeing a lot of</font>

941
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:56,729
wise horizontal because you're cutting

942
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,410
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wires themselves and then on the</font>

943
00:48:56,729 --> 00:49:00,808
top on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom riders are the</font>

944
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,269
packaging machines I'm not sure actually

945
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:05,880
these are limits these are my hobby the

946
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:08,058
wire bond machines were using the old

947
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,059
days

948
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:17,160
okay then that we ship the product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

949
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:20,110
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> done right so so here the summary</font>

950
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,569
so ASIC technology as we can see we

951
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:24,250
transform the network industry we gave

952
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:28,000
the performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> boost we desperately</font>

953
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:30,660
need so the internet is exploding well

954
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,340
not exploding is that but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

955
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:35,589
grows exponentially easier technologies

956
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:38,260
require for them for us to reach that

957
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:40,900
performance level that we are to deliver

958
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,360
and silicon process technology is

959
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,310
evolving at a very impressive pace and

960
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,960
Moore's law but architectural

961
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:51,430
innovations are still required to keep

962
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:54,010
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the performance demand and you</font>

963
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:56,620
can see there the design and

964
00:49:54,010 --> 00:50:02,920
verification process architectural phase

965
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:05,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very important and it's very</font>

966
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,670
long it's very rigorous to implement

967
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:12,430
these complex devices and<font color="#CCCCCC"> big and also</font>

968
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:14,050
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> large number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off we</font>

969
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,290
make doing the architecture in the

970
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:20,290
design phase and it takes that many

971
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:23,820
years to produce these these devices so

972
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:27,400
we would like you as the user community

973
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:30,820
to give us feedback what you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

974
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,920
to see in five years three years five

975
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:37,210
years from now so that we can design a

976
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:42,790
better product for you right so um I

977
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:45,310
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it and we are opening up</font>

983
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,470
am curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you could maybe provide</font>

some of your experience and comment on

985
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:08,529
what you see as far as maybe the

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">trajectory or in terms of where things</font>

respects to power budget and allocation

989
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,660
of power among say componentry of the

00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,640
ASIC you described here with of course

991
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,129
it has some memory and has some logic

992
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,660
and as a bunch of glue on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it where do</font>

993
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:27,210
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things happening maybe you say</font>

994
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,890
in the tcam world and you know

00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,200
specialized look up Tye basics or

996
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:33,540
controller asics that use these parts

997
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,149
where is the power going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

998
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:41,670
more or maybe going less as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

999
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:46,320
things going<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the future here that's a</font>

difficult question to answer in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

1001
00:51:46,320 --> 00:52:00,300
of decamp<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the the market is cut</font>

is condensing free fast currently so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1003
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:07,230
see challenges how how how they they

1004
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:13,160
will scale to a higher performance

1005
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:13,160
without increasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pollen more so</font>

1006
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,260
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess i guess they took cut to</font>

1007
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:22,080
the chase<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess the question is do you</font>

1008
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:23,280
see are scaling tcam up against you know

1009
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,490
the natural limits of what we can

00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:34,709
or things like the IP to IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of</font>

1013
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:37,620
course you know SRAM arranged or<font color="#E5E5E5"> deram</font>

1014
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:40,520
arranged around a smart smarter or

1015
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:43,170
perhaps increasingly partition ship and

1016
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,420
maybe this is naive but is that is the

1017
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:48,690
power budget and the e io capability

1018
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:51,450
actually a bounding factor in you know

1019
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:57,990
tcam design versus other memories<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font>

1020
00:52:51,450 --> 00:53:01,049
search asics um so I'm trying to not to

1021
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:05,220
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about specific stuff company so so</font>

1022
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:07,230
on that it it's one reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> the x-ray</font>

1023
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:10,529
juniper does not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> T</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> camp that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much is</font>

1024
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:15,740
we are shy away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power so so I</font>

1025
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:19,920
see I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> T cam is by nature a parallel</font>

1026
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:22,109
logic process so it by nature it will it

1027
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,930
will burn more power than then time<font color="#CCCCCC"> m</font>

1028
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:27,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">tande SRAM memories themselves so I</font>

1029
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:29,460
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the vendors that they are</font>

1030
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,930
looking at different ways of improving

1031
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,340
that so I

1032
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:36,520
don't want to speak for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> but but</font>

1033
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:38,680
they get they get a tough tough road

1034
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,540
ahead of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keikain more</font>

1035
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,700
scalable in type of power<font color="#E5E5E5"> in performance</font>

1036
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,350
yeah with an absolute agreement that

1037
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,060
your opinion here is just yours not

1038
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:48,640
junipers do you see that being more

1039
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,560
likely a future or what do you see maybe

1040
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,390
is the gut feeling what's going to both

1041
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:56,200
be the most reasonable you know

1042
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:58,120
arrangement in your mind um yeah I i we

1043
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">well the tcam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor to I don't want to</font>

1044
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:03,910
alienate them too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much so so I think</font>

1045
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:06,939
your purity cam approach is probably

1046
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:10,960
difficult to scale but but there are

1047
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:13,480
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different way to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve the</font>

1048
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:18,460
problem using some algorithm outdoor

1049
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:20,440
mythic of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and some dirty cans so</font>

1050
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,900
there might be a way to do that but it's

1051
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult that you can market is and</font>

1052
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,620
also right now that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

1053
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:29,049
vendors is solving that market is

1054
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:31,270
decreasing pretty fast as well so that's

1055
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:33,970
another factor that that may or may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1056
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:37,600
be technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> related it's just the</font>

1057
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:40,740
price of that I I I don't know how they

1058
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:43,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">will go in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> future thank you yeah</font>

1059
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,100
another into click<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and thanks for</font>

1060
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,750
talks is very interesting I don't know

1061
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,630
anything about hardware design<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

1062
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:53,470
them good to see how the part of how the

1063
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:55,300
sausage is made so to speak um 11 curacy

1064
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have is that you talked a lot about</font>

1065
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,990
the detail of the design<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

1066
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,760
manufacturing process but what what I

1067
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:04,569
don't know and maybe others people do

1068
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:06,160
know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> um what how do you go from there</font>

1069
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,500
into something that can do firewall

1070
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,200
filters and

1071
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,820
and tries and things like that which

1072
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,710
would like the upper level things so

1073
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,240
what kind of primitives do these chip up

1074
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:18,360
tips offer do they have an instruction

1075
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,859
set that's comparable to like 88 86 or

1076
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,440
today what what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they then</font>

1077
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,610
offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> software uh-huh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

1078
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good question that that's something</font>

1079
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:32,570
yeah I did not address it depends on

1080
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">each generation and it of course that</font>

1081
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:38,100
the memory choices are depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

1082
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:42,060
algorithm look up algorithm as well the

1083
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:45,029
ACR algorithm definitely if and some of

1084
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,799
them I know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the vendor use he</font>

1085
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,360
cam to look up<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I mean it's kind</font>

1086
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,570
of very natural to look up an IP address

1087
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:55,830
from the tcam and and juniper use a tree

1088
00:55:51,570 --> 00:56:00,060
hi look up right so so I can see in the

1089
00:55:55,830 --> 00:56:03,900
future people we use hashing to do that

1090
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:07,740
as well and I I don't there may be

1091
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:09,870
already implementation using that of

1092
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:12,299
course they<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it's very important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

1093
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:15,930
algorithm will decide how what kind of

1094
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:18,000
memory subsystem or even some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the is</font>

1095
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,799
look at my the internal and some of them

1096
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,110
may be external and that that will play

1097
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,450
a bake bake bake bro in there that is

1098
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:26,850
stunning architectural face I'll have to

1099
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:28,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">choke so in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense it's more like</font>

1100
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,630
hardware acceleration founding graphics

1101
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:32,190
cards in like a general-purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU</font>

1102
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,600
right you start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the algorithm and</font>

1103
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:36,750
then you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to accelerate it</font>

1104
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,819
and you tightly integrate things correct

1105
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:40,500
basically I wouldn't say start from

1106
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:42,540
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of interaction you have</font>

1107
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider both when you're designing</font>

1108
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,790
the algorithm and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips so you have</font>

1109
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:50,100
to know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available</font>

1110
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:52,020

00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,970
up technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the algorithm</font>

1112
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:57,330
technology that's available to you and

1113
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:58,980
use it to your best ability at that time

1114
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:02,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are changing as well as you</font>

1115
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:04,620
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say as we can see so a few years</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the perfect algorithm a few years</font>

00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:24,549
yes hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris woodfield yahoo i was</font>

1122
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering at what point do you tend to</font>

1123
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:30,640
find operations that are easily

by general purpose and wondering it has

1127
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,540
i was wondering has that changed

1128
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:43,090
significantly over the years are their

1129
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,680
operations that used to be easier better

1130
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:46,510
more efficient to do in a general on

1131
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,759
like a general-purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are now</font>

1134
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:01,510
silicon technologies as always

1135
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:04,500
everything is easier but but then also

1136
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:11,640
your demand on the bandwidth also is

1137
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:14,620
increase in exponential fashion so so I

1138
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,569
it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trade-off that that that</font>

1139
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:20,740
you need to make doing the architectural

phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the design phase so what should</font>

1141

be done in software and what should be

1142

done in hardware and that there's no

1143
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:30,850

00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:55,000
chips before you've actually constructed

1154
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,340
them in silicon and you're trying to

1155
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,110
simulate waveforms and timing and

1156
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:02,680
interactions between different chips and

1157
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:04,900
different parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip at what at</font>

1158
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,940
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed can you simulate that I'm how</font>

1159
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,070
close is it one thousandth of real-time

1160
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:13,150
one when millionth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time or or</font>

1161
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:15,220
what how how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the simulator which is</font>

00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">just making believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're silicon</font>

1163
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:20,680
there how close does it get to the real

1164
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:23,560
silicon and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what speed can you</font>

1165
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,190
do it there are even<font color="#E5E5E5"> simulation</font>

1166
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:29,210
technology there was several

1167
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:31,250
and and the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe</font>

1168
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:32,960
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just software simulations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1169
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:36,079
just one on real machine those are very

1170
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,730
very very slow it's not thousands it's

1171
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,680
probably millions on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slower than the</font>

1172
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:42,050
real silicon but there are some

1173
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,089
technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cocoa emulation they</font>

1174
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,800
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to compile your chips into</font>

1175
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:49,759
hardware and running those will be

1176
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:52,069
faster so so it's still but nothing

1177
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,660
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it which</font>

1178
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:56,210
software based<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach is millions</font>

1179
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,980
times slower and in the in the emulation

1180
00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:00,589
properly thousand times<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sword but</font>

1181
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:03,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's emulation you text more effort to</font>

1182
01:00:00,589 --> 01:00:06,349
put them in in the emulator so so

1183
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:13,910
there's a trade-off there that that need

1184
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:16,819
to be made yeah white google so I think

1185
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:20,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just heard you saying because</font>

1186
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:23,599
networking changes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asic technology</font>

1187
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:25,550

1188
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,970
years or five years is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1189
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:33,579
fact what you said um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

1190
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:33,578
that but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm just saying</font>

1191
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:38,960
internal technology I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

1192
01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:40,549
oval network protocol and all that is

1193
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,130
going to change but how we implement

1194
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:45,829
that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cile asics may have to change</font>

1195
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:47,990
your Sam so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that the way</font>

1196
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:49,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">we design networks is in fact static and</font>

1197
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:50,990
doesn't change and then the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1198
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:52,549
that changes is the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1199
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:56,118
the networking yeah I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1200
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:57,589
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure so but because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would impact</font>

1201
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,050
claim that networking changes all the

1202
01:00:57,589 --> 01:01:03,440
time it's right in you're right that the

1203
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:05,300
technology changes all the time but if

1204
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,280
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making me you know if you're if</font>

1205
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:10,130
you're trying to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this and say</font>

1206
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,380
that I have to use this hardware at this

1207
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:15,250
point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this is how the</font>

1208
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:17,359
networking goes then that really

1209
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:20,480
constrains the way I can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network</font>

1210
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,339
and and in that case it<font color="#E5E5E5"> may very well be</font>

1211
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,730
that all this complexity that you've

1212
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:27,470
built in to the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nobody in</font>

1213
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:30,170
this room uses a hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

1214
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:33,109
the time but is in fact the wrong way to

1215
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:35,260
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your point earlier about</font>

1216
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:38,510
no functional layouts and

1217
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:41,330
compartmentalizing is well taken but in

1218
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:45,230
the end if if nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can wants</font>

1220
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:50,210
these devices are remarkably

1221
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:54,170
programmable<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so we we try to</font>

1222
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:56,510
anticipate that the changes so in fact

1223
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:58,520
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the junipers product we</font>

1224
01:01:56,510 --> 01:02:01,000
released in 1998 they are still in the

1225
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">network's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today and then these are</font>

remarkably programmable devices they can

1227
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:07,520
adapt to changes and but we are of

1228
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:10,310
course we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anticipate much of</font>

1229
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:12,890
this to do that and but there they are

variable grand mobile devices that they

course it will not run as fast and some

of the feature may or may not be

fortunate that IP forwarding this is

1268
01:03:54,980 --> 01:04:01,250
and that the actual feature set that we

require there on you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:07,220
vantage point of forwarding a packet is

1271
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,840
pretty small to the extent that we don't

1272
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:11,120
crap that up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the additional</font>

01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:16,550
complexity I think that's a smooth move

on our part thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so thank you</font>
