invite our next speaker up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as</font>

work okay there's one of you okay

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,969
our slideshows

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:52,960
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so continuing on this team you</font>

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,589
now have work on looking at large<font color="#CCCCCC"> leak</font>

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,960
detection hi my name is a friend John

00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,630
I'm assistant professor from University

<font color="#CCCCCC">of Arizona today I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly</font>

12
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,140
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our recent work on detecting</font>

13
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,810
automatically detecting larger droplets

same thing as prefect sky tracking it

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,610
just only difference is the intention so

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,560
probably it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> caught by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss</font>

attack in such an event and network

22
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,009

networks without appropriate Australia

24
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,050
authorization in this scenario there are

25
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,210
actually three different parties the

26
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,119
prefix owner which is the supposed to

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,369
the destination of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> Skyjack happens the victims is</font>

00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:09,310
really not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the prefix owner but</font>

35
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:11,140
also the source networks who actually

36
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:16,120
send traffic to the perfect they also

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:19,329
suffer from mr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gopnik the current</font>

41
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,319

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,450
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens on the internet because</font>

43
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,010
PGP doesn't tells me so I have to

44
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,769
collect the information from remote

45
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,560
monitors and collect all the routing

46
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,740
announcement and carrier alerts back to

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,040
my network then I process this data I I

48
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:48,220
decide which one is a real attack then I

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">take some actions corrupt</font>

50
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:55,270
I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> network or upstream isp of the</font>

51
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:57,430
network try to stop this attack but the

52
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem of this is the process takes</font>

53
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:04,210
time in the case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube prefix</font>

54
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,399
hijacked by<font color="#E5E5E5"> pakistan telecom a tu como</font>

55
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,920
it took more than two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours to stop the</font>

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,700
attack so during<font color="#CCCCCC"> this time your data</font>

57
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,850
traffic is vulnerable whoever sending

the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this prefix the traffic</font>

59
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,060
will be diverted and black hope so

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,529
youtube actually has the outage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write</font>

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hours this picture just shows what i</font>

62
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,030
said in a previous slide about<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

63
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:35,380
parties well the prefix owner is trying

64
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:37,420
to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack which takes time the</font>

65
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,370
other networks are still sending your

66
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,130
traffic and that perfect can be diverted

67
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,610
to the hacker so the question the

68
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,040
challenge is really how do we protect

69
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:51,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic before the prefix owner is able</font>

70
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,510
to stop attack a straightforward answer

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,489
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what if i can identify those</font>

72
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">four surrounding announcement and just</font>

73
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,050
throw it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my way I don't take that</font>

74
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,380
force<font color="#E5E5E5"> path I don't send perfect order</font>

75
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,230
attack but as we know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

76
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:12,790
legitimate reasons for prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

77
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:14,320
our region so if for other network now

78
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous owner had another</font>

79
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,909

80
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,849
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> an announcement it's very</font>

81
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,430
difficult to tell whether this region

82
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:28,060
change is a legitimate or not so it's

83
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:31,030
very difficult to do this to catch all

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,729
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four slotting announcement what we</font>

86
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:39,190
actually relatively easier to identify

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,590
say with very high confidence say okay

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now announcement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably very</font>

likely they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not leaks or hijacks so</font>

90
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:52,599
that's our goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch those cases</font>

91
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,960
with high confidence and enable I space

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,669
the type of loading announcement the

95
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,389
fourth type of force routing

96
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,669
announcement we are going after is as

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:11,300
falling so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes a network they</font>

those knowledge extreme cases that makes

this very small part of the table we

112
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:52,150
want to automatically detect this

113
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,159
without help from prefix owner so

114
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:58,159
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no need there's no requirement</font>

from any authoritative information from

false positives<font color="#CCCCCC"> so all of this is trying</font>

for supporting announcement the basic so

121
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,810
how we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the basic observation is</font>

122
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:26,508
if one is hijacks a prefix of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single</font>

123
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,030
other a yes it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard to say</font>

124
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:32,270
whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> legit or not however is</font>

125
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,508
one way as high extreme time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried</font>

126
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,060
multiple prefixes that belongs to many

different eight networks at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

128
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,630
time then we say it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

129
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:46,940
a hijack and a leak all basic approaches

130
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,360
get all the region changes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> btp data</font>

131
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,750
and filter out of those probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key</font>

132
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,150
changes and remaining site of suspicious

133
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,120
cause suspicion starting announcement

134
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:02,179
then we look at whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

135
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,339
of a single a is simultaneously

other networks

138
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,949
first we precise<font color="#E5E5E5"> btp raw data to get all</font>

139
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,049
the region changes however there are way

140
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:19,139
too many oranges if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all the</font>

141
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,440
ETP data and most of them actually legit

142
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,889
changes so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the following five</font>

143
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,580
criteria to filter out those possible

announced this prefix for more than one

we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a relic of</font>

distribution of the orphans value from

184
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:34,260
from love you Oregon collectors you can

185
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:37,520
see the x-axis is often orphans value

186
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,760
how many networks you are funding and

187

y-axis is a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> events with with</font>

two but there's a long tail over there

191
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:59,280
and we cut the threshold a detail so

192
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,670
apply this simple algorithm through the

193
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,699
data from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lord will Oregon collector</font>

high-tech we didn't send emails about

209

early years because probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's too</font>

210
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,980
old and operators won't have the

219
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:23,970
surely is a full table<font color="#CCCCCC"> league so out of</font>

00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:27,180
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 events we only found one event</font>

on an analyst and that is a full public

in 2008 by rush

223
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,820
nicely all the other floating events we

224
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,459
didn't find it in and nog or other

ethnic or other any other operator

mailing list so basically most of people

227
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:47,899
are not aware of that some of the

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know when we send it email</font>

they say hey this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my prefix someone</font>

this out how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so basically</font>

235
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,130
this says even though we are now trying

<font color="#E5E5E5">to catch all the critics I tracks of out</font>

none of this is full table<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak the</font>

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,399
at the division some of them are very

on the internet and this is confirming

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:05,300
that so what do we learn is actually 895

269
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:08,250
was the provider of most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

smaller local high speeds but those IPS

271
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:16,160
actually switched rather to another isp

272
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:18,750
so but due to a Miss configuration 895

announcer prefix of this ice cosmos

274

that's what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and this is</font>

the offense value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight a 95 phone in</font>

the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ovens value is almost there so</font>

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">only this two hours all of starting to</font>

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:49,290
see dolphins events jump to 2003 and

282
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,050
this is a distribution of the deletion

of the.net events of all the events we

284
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,560

290
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:22,530

like 70 idiot prefixes and how what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

292
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,449
the impact on the internet this is

293
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,750
percentage of loud<font color="#E5E5E5"> will monitors that</font>

294
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:33,950
attacked those events because eighty

295
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:37,110
percent of these events actually

296
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,660
observed by more than sixty percent of

297
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,400
the monitors so they are impacting

298
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,400
significant part of the internet

299
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,190
this work has the same goal as a pretty

300
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:53,670
good PGP of protecting data traffic by

301
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:56,250
non prefix owner network but we have

302
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">different approaches pretty good PDP</font>

303
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,920
blog all the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> original announcement</font>

304
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">so they can catch all the prefix</font>

305
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,410
hijacked by the same time you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

306
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have many many false positives we are</font>

307
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,250
now trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch all of them we are</font>

308
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to catch a small number of them</font>

309
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,990
but with very high confidence as our

310
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,849
result shows all the 15 events we have

311
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,810
try to confirm having confirmed

312
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:25,589
positively and + operators are not very

313
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:28,109
positive feedbacks so by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but</font>

314
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:31,199
because the result is very with high

315
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:35,089
confidence so hopefully can enable some

316
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,949
automatic reaction there are two

317
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:40,620
potential deployment scenarios one is in

318
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:43,560
video network and run days in their

319
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,300
network in getting the real PGP feet

320
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,219
from your border router and run this

321
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,380
algorithm detect the weather is if

322
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,199
loudly going long it plays talk with a

323
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,820
four starting announcement you could set

324
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,310
up high straight on in this work we

325
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,589
sense right hold a pen you could set a

326
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,750
higher threshold for automatic response

327
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:04,110
or you put a high horse or lower

328
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,839
threshold say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it is five then I</font>

329
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,458
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look if it's 20 or 100 I</font>

330
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,819
wanted automatic a tour of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

331
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,429
announcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deponent scenario</font>

332
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,980
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to incorporate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into monitoring system</font>

333
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:19,620
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyclops so the users not only get</font>

334
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,669
alerts about their prefix but also get

335
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:26,280
alerts about her ongoing rock licks and

336
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:29,370
we have some ganglion work about

337
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">including algorithm and running this on</font>

338
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:37,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-time and incorporated into sec ups</font>

339
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:39,559
so that's it questions we have any

340
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,559
questions

341
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,990
okay thank you very much
