first topic which is jon is going to

a few words about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole thing</font>

came about as many of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,420
for comcast and and we've recently

announced earlier this year some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">plans to do a variety of ip6 related</font>

with you know with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our subscriber base</font>

54
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,890
you can imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had I got a lot</font>

55
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:29,679
of email about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's lots of</font>

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,970
questions one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,920
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seemed like it was a natural</font>

58
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,660
thing to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do is to organize</font>

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,769
a panel like this instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

60
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,970
reply unicast to 500 emails so you know

61
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,090
we were getting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of questions about</font>

62
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,250
you know what to you know what does the

63
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,140
home network have to look like what

64
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">products you know with this with that</font>

65
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,000
what protocol what RFC so this seems

66
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,440
like a really good way you know via

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,170
panel to kind of help get something

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,390
information out and offer you guys an

69
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,010
opportunity to to be very interactive

70
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,238
with the folks who actually build the

71
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,190
product and ultimately myself included

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,860
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how those things</font>

73
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">will work as part of those trials so a</font>

74
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,810
bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shameless plug you know if you</font>

75
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,519
have not signed up for our files and

76
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,950
you're interested it is most certainly

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,569
not too late I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should probably have a</font>

78
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,179
slide up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tells you some more</font>

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:25,780
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that but I don't the</font>

website is ww comcast the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> six net</font>

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,070
so for anybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not aware of that</font>

82
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,130
by all means please you know check it

83
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,700
out and let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font>

84
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,620
and you know and then dough and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

85
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,798
explore the possibilities of including

86
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,360
in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those trials briefly what</font>

87
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,620
I'll do is I'll give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font>

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,120
an overview of<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the things that</font>

89
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are looking at from a trial point of</font>

90
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,329
view obviously we've announced a number

91
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,510
of different trial technologies ranging

92
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,630
from commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual-stack through to a</font>

93
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,929
number of residential ipv6 related

94
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:05,190
technologies one of those which will be

95
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting actually very soon is six rd</font>

96
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,019
from a comcast point of view we think

97
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:14,320
you know we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the</font>

98
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:17,890
six rd is a very good enabler for folks

99
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:21,829
who have access networks that are

100
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:24,039
largely not capable of native ipv6

101
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,090
you know they can't support<font color="#E5E5E5"> native ip6</font>

102
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,610
from a comp case point of view it's not

103
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,318
clear to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to what extent we will</font>

104
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,080
use this in there in a kind of

105
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,729
production rollout but we do think you

106
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we do talk to people who ask us</font>

107
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,389
for advice and want to collaborate we do

108
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,090
we do kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of advise them that it looks</font>

109
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a useful technology and folks</font>

110
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,508
really to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the one thing</font>

111
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,520
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed is that there are</font>

112
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:47,960
still some Stilton still some<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that</font>

113
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,960
needs to be done perfectly from from a

114
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,840
DCP point of view and maybe we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

115
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,280
into some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is part of the QA</font>

116
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,460
secondly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have secondly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and certainly</font>

117
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,989
most centrally to our plans are native

118
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">dual stack residential over a docsis</font>

119
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,000
connection this basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the type of</font>

120
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,389
scenario where you have a home router

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,159
where your v4 is what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is today we</font>

122
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,680
know it's an unchanged and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply add</font>

123
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:14,029
ipv6 to it so again one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

124
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,409
that you'll see here as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

125
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:16,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">panel is you know product</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

126
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:18,860
information about products that support

127
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,270
that mode of operation and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

128
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,000
feel that that is a mode of operation

129
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,188
that you know it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,990
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use for for an extended</font>

131
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,599
period of time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as or for as</font>

132
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,819
long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can you know given that our</font>

133
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:33,409
network is largely capable of supporting

134
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:36,620
that mode of operation we feel that this

135
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:39,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is is it's good for us</font>

136
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,909
as part of our v6 deployment and list

137
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:43,159
but not least we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have</font>

138
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,870
probably some trials maybe towards end

139
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:47,270
of this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps since early next</font>

140
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,550
for dual stack lite dual stack lights is

141
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,580
one of those technologies where you know

142
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,860
it certainly implies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there has been</font>

about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> broader point of using ipv6 to</font>

simplify communicating over the Internet

at large here's something else we did

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,939
with ipv6 apple's mobileme service

231

allows you easy access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all your email</font>

automate the allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

will be releasing iphone OS or iOS for

later this month and you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,668
noticed that current versions of iphone

it we don't sell them this way the good

slides here I'm going to rush through

548

them because the other panelists<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

549
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:05,860
much more to say about this than I do we

550
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:07,600
like six rd which is a great way to roll

out v6 service without having to touch

your existing ipv4 networks you just

567
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,870
is a better protocol for figuring out

572
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,929
is it tunnels ipv4 through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> large-scale</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">NAT over ipv6</font>

574
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,300
and you should consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> it an exit</font>

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,810
strategy for for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dual stack go to dual</font>

stack first and then figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to</font>

577
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,500
remove ipv4 from your access network

578
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:24,930
while still providing v4 service to

579
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:28,000
legacy customers and lastly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

delivering ipv6 to its customers without

doing this you might be growing slowly

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,420
enough that you never reach the limits

00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,910
of ipv4 you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be culturally</font>

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,650
averse to taking new steps in any case

<font color="#E5E5E5">apple is busy helping their customers</font>

594
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,160
we're going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to get ipv6</font>

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,379
if your application is on the iTunes App

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,590
Store<font color="#E5E5E5"> today then it's probably ipv6</font>

601
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:17,440
ready now unless it is really i mean i

602
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,689
was at WWDC last week and most of the

603
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,780
developers didn't even know or care and

604
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,810
only a few we're looking at at figuring

605
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:28,030
out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to undo their legacy application</font>

606
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:32,320
code that looks directly at ipv4

607
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,639
addresses so we're well past the point

608

would you consider I'd be calling at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

625
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:43,629
and you know the basic truth of the

00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:45,789
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it retains aunt and I piece of</font>

00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:47,168
ethics and you'll just just keep that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

628
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind that you know we're only touching</font>

629
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:51,399
tunnel endpoints and also is review

630
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,840
there's two different transition

632
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,519
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> James referring to is basically</font>

633
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,109
the dual stack light approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

636
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:04,119
talking about in this slide deck right

637
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:05,559
now which is called height 6 rd fort

638
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:16,570
which is for rapid or a fast deployment

639
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:20,859
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i meant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out then why ipv6 not</font>

640
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:23,139
before so obviously you know deployment

up a fully native ipv6 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> henrik who</font>

642
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:27,099
would require numerous system components

00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:29,739
to change and some of those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very</font>

644
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:31,059
convenient<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example like upgrading</font>

key points one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that prefix delegation</font>

the draft this rewrite some points we

701
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">have on the previous slide but again</font>

702
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,539
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no need for v6 on the percentage</font>

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,760
of presidential gateway land interface

707
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,380
really importantly to there's no

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,600
subscribers tunnel stay your

709
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,559
provisioning it's really boils down

710
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,459
almost purely to a routing problem so

711
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:12,610
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little about the prefix</font>

712
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,889
delegation here's two different examples

713
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,510
and don't this again I want to emphasize

<font color="#E5E5E5">that these are just examples there's a</font>

715
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:21,730
lot of flexibility in this technology

716
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,290
and what else<font color="#E5E5E5"> could help some of it here</font>

717
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,580
but

718
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,190
basically what you do for the ipv6

719
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,290
prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got the classic park</font>

720
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,680
on the left there in green and in this

<font color="#E5E5E5">top examples of / 28 then you provision</font>

723
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,129
with the customers ipv4 address those

724
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:42,030
two combined or what makes the pretext

725
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,770
delegation right now the number of bits

726
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use there in the previous can vary</font>

727
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:49,350
depending upon what you're doing with

728
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,200
will be with you the deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

729
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,370
what's important to realize is that

730
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,680
what's here shown in the green the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue</font>

00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:59,610

732
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:01,830
right if you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use because your / 20</font>

733
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,050
/ 32 and however many bits you want

734
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:06,030
other phone my teeth before I was part

735
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,250
of it as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as those are the same in</font>

736
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,080
this particular rd domain you're

737
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,530
implementing this if those of you are

738
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:18,330
familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6241 big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difference is</font>

739
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:20,610
that what a classic Roman / 16 right on

740
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,870
top of it yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> MA and this but</font>

741
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:25,379
let's take a look at example how this

742
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,840
this works in practice so on the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

743
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,730
the top you path you see there in the

744
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,429
dash black line in the bottom is the

745
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:36,810
blue line so on the black this is if

746
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">your prefix that as a positive match</font>

747
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:42,450
basically you you route from one

748
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,980
residents to another residence if it

749
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,760
doesn't match<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is in the blue you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">forward it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the board to relay and in</font>

751
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,480
discussing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I don't work on</font>

752
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:55,050
this as part of my day-to-day job right

753
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,480
eye on this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco work on this and</font>

754
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,770
in learning more about this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

755
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,450
that we've come up with to try to

756
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">explain this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to people how this works is</font>

757
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,100
if you're having problems understanding

758
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,750
this it's like think of this rd domain

759
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,370
is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like one great big huge</font>

760
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:11,100

763
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,250
about each home is being like an

DVRs like the land port you can look at

766
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,070
Goa wait that's sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense it's</font>

767
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,350
sort of weird concept but thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

768
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,639
this is a great big huge explode gateway

769
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,139
you sort of get your head around what's

770
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,600
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and then it becomes</font>

771
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,740
pretty straightforward and it's a pretty

775
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:46,250
there's four main things that you have

reformed actually decide on a prefix

but but the fact remains of this can

788
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:20,389
work and argument that the land site

the important points are that the word

834
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,250
real important part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is that you</font>

835
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,990
know you're using v6 you know in a

836

method a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple methodology to trans</font>

838
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,110
you don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to deploy a</font>

lot of changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network in order</font>

840
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:35,440
to get basic services to your subscriber

841
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,210
there is a penalty obviously there's an

842
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,120
extra overhead<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the man capsulation</font>

exhaustion but this it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear to be</font>

846
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:49,569
an effective transitory mechanism

847
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,679
especially for providers who have a lot

848
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of difficulty and upgrading the existing</font>

850
00:34:54,610 --> 00:35:02,130
enough on that and next presenter thanks

00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,080
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk technology I feel like</font>

856
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,060
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a ccie in ipv6 thank you for</font>

857
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,880
that very educational I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

858
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,400
at it from the ground up as you all know

859
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,950
netgear has a very strong consumer

860
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,960
presence right some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have met</font>

861
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">here at home some people have met here</font>

862
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,760
in their business we also work very

863
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,820
closely with service providers that's

864
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,910
why we're here so what does ipv6 mean

865
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,560
for netgear for nekkid we looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

866
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,750
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways right first we look at what is</font>

867
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,009
the consumer one and how many consumers

868
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,370
out there do you know they're looking

869
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:58,830
for ipv6 if you go out to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average</font>

870
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,600
user and you say what's ipv6 they'll

871
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,630
probably tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our Kelly</font>

872
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,430
went to jail or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

873
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so ipv6 doesn't matter for the</font>

874
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,680
home all they care about is that they

875
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,300
have all their home applications all

876
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,700
their networking applications whether

877
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,330
they just bought a new iPhone or in a

878
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,620
new apple laptop or whatever product it

879
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,360
may be whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Nikki or</font>

880
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,640
another consumer company they want it to

881
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,640
work so how does neck your deal with

882
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,650
that as well as deal with the change so

883
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,180
ipv6 is kind of a change it's not

884
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,880
necessarily an application there's

885
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,319
nothing sexy about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 no one is</font>

886
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,540
running out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stores no one's going</font>

887
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,030
to wait in line it that's by to get any

888
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:41,130
ipv6 products right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like</font>

889
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,600
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> there has been a hole in the</font>

890
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:45,330
network and now we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> to patch</font>

891
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,850
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's really how ipv6 is viewed</font>

892
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,620
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> neck here so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem out</font>

893
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,620
there that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to patch so how are</font>

894
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,359
we patching this right so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

895
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,920
few ways we're looking at passions we're

896
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,630
looking at first we're working with our

897
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,030
service providers I will have this

898
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,010
comcast want to tackle ipv6 because

899
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,620
really at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day we're more</font>

900
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,540
in the reactive position aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we it's</font>

901
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,270
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like security when something bad</font>

902
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,640
happens you have to react<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it so how</font>

903
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:14,559
do we react to ipv6 well

904
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,038
clearly the first thing we need to do is

905
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:20,140
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's 110 percent</font>

906
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:23,920
transparent to the consumer the consumer

907
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,569
should not have to speak IP at all the

908
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,849
consumer should bring a product home

909
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:29,980
they should turn it on and it they

910
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:32,019
shouldn't know if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> running ipv</font>

911
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,549
anything they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that it they</font>

912
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,680
can turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it can connect to the</font>

913
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:37,359
internet and it works now that's a bit

914
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,339
of a challenge for us on the networking

915
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,990
side it's a bit of a challenge for the

916
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:42,880
service providers from the networking

917
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,319
side we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of listen</font>

918
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,079
see what service provider wants to do

919
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:48,519
from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> end what we have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is be</font>

920
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,970
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to react we have to give service</font>

921
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:53,618
pod as the right management right so

922
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,828
that means we might have to have a dual

923
00:37:53,619 --> 00:38:00,760
stack ipv6 and ipv4 we don't have

924
00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:03,309
necessarily a position on do we care if

925
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,410
we not do we not<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT do we protect the</font>

926
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:07,690
end user knows that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

927
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:10,618
something for netgear to really make a

928
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:12,880
decision on from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security perspective</font>

929
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,230
it's a little difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell what</font>

930
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,660
security is going to look like in six

931
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,059
months right does anyone know how

932
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,170
they're going to hack in six months

933
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,089
anyone know what new viruses are coming

934
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,880
no one knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> really so it's kind of a</font>

935
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:27,279
reactive thing and and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> point there is</font>

936
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,140
that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ipv6 security in</font>

937
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:30,640
the home I can bring on a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

938
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,618
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know about in the small/medium</font>

939
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,558
business and small/medium business is

940
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:39,700
just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hairline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> above the consumer level</font>

941
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,750
of understanding for networking and what

942
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,700
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're going to need some</font>

943
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a layered networking defense</font>

944
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,890
right the more you're going to the more

945
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:49,029
you expose your addresses directly to

946
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,150
the internet the more you're going to

947
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:53,440
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a layered defense and and when we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are looking at future products we're</font>

00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:59,440
can we put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there what's the lair</font>

defense layered defense is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're</font>

952
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,759
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basic firewalling right</font>

brute force they can't do the basics

958
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:15,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">right this is welcome to like 1989</font>

959

963
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,890
right right off the bat we're going to

964
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we try to block the</font>

viruses right on

966
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,480
right on the edge right and we're

967
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,849
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with service writers we have</font>

968
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,740
products that that will work with in the

969
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,790
service provider network where maybe the

970
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,319
consumer doesn't have to worry about

971
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font>

972
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,000
through the service provider or we have

973
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:43,869
it right on our edge router that will

974
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,820
take care of it so smart products go we

975
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:48,220
do have the ultimate networking machine

976
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:51,250
anyone familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this product it's a</font>

977
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:54,640
dual band I shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say dual band</font>

978
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,740
it's a it's a it supports both 2.4

979
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,990
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wireless

980
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,299
networking and from the back end it just

981
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">does everything for you right it does</font>

982
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,040
storage the security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does all</font>

983
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,839
your basic networking stuff why do we

984
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:11,109
have to have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of product in the</font>

985
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,710
network because the home network is very

986
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:17,680
complex these days as we saw from that

987
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:19,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple network that is an incredibly did</font>

988

someone with a ccie to configure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

989
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,430

990
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:26,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's that's really intimidating</font>

991
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:28,960
for the for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the average home user that's</font>

992
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,490
why you have companies like Best Buy

993
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,890
with their geek squad they're charging

00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,930
a scary thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumer however</font>

997
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:43,810
everyone wants everything connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:55,930
images and music and movies off of that

1003
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:57,700

00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,589
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on my TV if I'm watching</font>

1006
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,700
something on my on my laptop and I

1007
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:05,710
decide I want to see it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

1008
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,899
screen I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push a button and watch</font>

1009
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,849
it on my on my screen right and

1010
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,200
obviously I'm talking about netgear

1011
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:13,420
technologies that we have going<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1012
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,189
now so that that puts it that's a bit of

1013
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,160
a challenge for us so what does ipv6

1014
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,170
then mean for these networking products

1015
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">right there's the how does how does a</font>

1016
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:26,920
product let's say my storage devices

1017
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,930
ipv4 but my router runs ipv6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iPad</font>

1018
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,930
is running ipv6 how do they communicate

1019
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,759
together right that's a bit of a

1020
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,140
challenge right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a bit of a</font>

1021
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,849
challenge how does everything talk

1022
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,598
within the network what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that going to</font>

1023
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:41,749
mean for the processing power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of someone</font>

1024
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:44,450
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they going to run extra</font>

1025
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:46,488
extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> cycles just so they can have it so</font>

1026
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:50,210
they can process these this traffic

1027
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:52,430
how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> affect critical data</font>

1028
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:55,430
such as video or voice when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1029
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:57,019
running both ipv6 and ipv4 so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1030
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,609
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have an answer to</font>

1031
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:02,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are challenges that we're looking</font>

1032
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:03,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">into and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more we see how exactly our</font>

1033
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:06,379
service provider is going to implement

1034
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:09,859
ipv6 it's really quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on</font>

1035
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:12,559
it so our theory behind ipv6 or

1036
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:16,479
philosophy right now is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have we</font>

1037
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:20,900
want to run ipv6 and ipv4 concurrently

1038
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:23,348
we don't want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat from six to four</font>

1039
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,819
even though we know it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1040
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:29,479
half a decade from now before every

1041
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:34,249
product in the home has ipv6 let's be

1042
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:37,368
realistic right people are not going to

1043
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:40,160
run I PVC 100% ipv6 networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the home</font>

1044
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:43,190
for quite some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of fact I</font>

1045
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,170
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a PC at home that I've had for 10</font>

1046
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,430
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there's gonna they're going</font>

1047
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,190
to be a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1048
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:51,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain devices that are running ipv4</font>

1049
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:54,380
for quite some time so the

1050
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,660
interoperability of ipv6 and ipv4 is

1051
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,269
going to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge an easy one to</font>

1052
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,930
solve it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of how do we</font>

1053
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:04,788
slice it and dice it and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

1054
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:06,200
application to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user because</font>

1055
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:08,329
again at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all we care</font>

1056
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,399
about we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care how comcast</font>

1057
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:12,079
implements ipv6 we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care what</font>

1058
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,359
they're doing out in the cloud all we

1059
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about is that when a customer buys</font>

1060
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:18,799
and neck your product that they can plug

1061
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:21,349
it into their network their home network

1062
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:28,788
plug it to their comcast device and it's

1063
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:31,779
seamless<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and again you know would</font>

1064
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:34,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">be the way the consumer home is now</font>

1065
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:37,039
you're at it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more advanced than</font>

1066
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:40,039
it used to be even a year ago right

1067
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,690
everyone wants connectivity everything

1068
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:43,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at home they want it all</font>

1069
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:46,549
to interoperate they want to be able to

1070
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:49,279
go to Starbucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and still view their</font>

1071
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:50,930
media on their home device at home right

1072
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:51,950
I mean who has a slingbox who has a

1073
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,990
readiness box

1074
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,700
we can view your pictures or movies or

1075
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,620
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not from anywhere in the world</font>

1076
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:01,189
pretty much right I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1077
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:03,140
watching a slingbox or a swingoff show

1078
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,940
and I was on the Lufthansa flight over

1079
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:09,410
to Europe I mean Here I am on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plane</font>

1080
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,520
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching my my show in three thirty</font>

1081
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand feet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> above the ground or</font>

1082
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,130
whatever it was so it connectivity is is

1083
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:17,630
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what we're looking at and at</font>

1084
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:20,210
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day I'll reiterate this</font>

1085
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,940
one more time transparency is what we

1086
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:25,580
care about in the home interoperability

1087
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,950
between products the home network and

1088
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:31,610
the service provider network it should

1089
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:33,379
be transparent and seamless<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1090
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,420
hope that that that you guys will have

1091
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">some questions for us on how we're</font>

1092
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,110
planning on doing that or what we're

1093
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,990
planning on doing in the future but

1094
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:44,810
please look at we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are you</font>

1102
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:13,509
ask some questions and yeah I trust that

1103
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:17,720
no one will be shy here certainly not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1104
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:20,450
not what I'm expecting Dave uh could you

1105
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,419
name in who your affiliation yeah Dave

1106

Meyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco you go um I was wondering</font>

1107
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:29,810
with these tunneling technologies like

1108
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:33,730
six rd or any of them less any of these

1109
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:38,860
ones what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you folks</font>

1110
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:41,480
perceive the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PMT you issue</font>

1111
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,940
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you perceive it to be threatening to</font>

1112
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:47,360
these technologies or not have you had

1113
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:49,010
experience where oh well you shoved one

1114
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,900
of your encapsulated packets

1115
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,230
accidentally down a GRE tunnel on it

1116
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:58,460
exceeds the PMT you and never came back

1117
00:45:53,230 --> 00:46:00,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">electa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can make comment unless you</font>

1118
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,210
guys wanna go first I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

1119
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:04,040
think based on what we're hearing so far

1120
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,890
with experience that that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1121
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,509
an issue right

1122
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,609
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that one of the</font>

1123
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:11,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">express you know one of the reasons we</font>

1124
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:13,200
are absolutely trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> our trials</font>

1125
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,820
you know started as soon as possible is

1126
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,220
there's a type of learnings that we're

1127
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,840
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel out of that right my</font>

1128
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,310
assumption at this point is is there

1129
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,330
there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there'll be something</font>

1130
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,670
there that could that could potentially

1131
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:25,860
be an impediment which again largely is

1132
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:28,740
why we were saying in native dual stack

1133
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,900
for us is<font color="#E5E5E5"> central and we know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1134
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:34,680
entire network is you know natively

1135
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:36,120
capable of ip6 I fortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't you</font>

1136
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,480
know I can't account for what happens

1137
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,890
once it leaves my network but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1138
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,110
know somewhat my feeling is is it you

1139
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:45,600
know when I come back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta you</font>

1140
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:48,740
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope to have something more</font>

1141
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:54,720
detailed to tell you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1142
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:55,979
absolutely so the technologies that

1143
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,750
we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here six are</font>

1144
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">key in dual spec light both of those</font>

1145
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:04,490
tunneling technologies are aimed at not

1146
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:08,250
really crossing any exterior gateway or

1147
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:11,399
boundaries so if you have happened to

1148
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you discovery problems they're gonna be</font>

1149
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,200
pretty much local to the administrative

1150
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:18,210
domain where you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run the</font>

1151
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">tunnel both endpoints are inside the</font>

1152
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:25,080
same routing domain it's not like 624 or

1153
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:27,390
tirado where when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a path into</font>

1154
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,370
your discovery problem or a black hole

1155
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,900
in the network you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> operators</font>

1156
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:32,670
pointing fingers at each other saying

1157
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,750
it's your fault<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should fix it no</font>

1158
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,150
it's your fault you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were in a tunnel</font>

1159
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:39,180
that affection you you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have problems</font>

1160
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:42,030
but it'll be problems you can control

1161
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:45,149
entirely yourself yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason I</font>

1162
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:48,240
asked was because with those

1163
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:50,580
technologies that basically you know six

1164
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">over for of any variety technologies</font>

1165
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:57,900
that have to traverse the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet I've</font>

1166
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:59,550
seen a lot of PMT issues like I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1167
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,520
give an example there was in one place

1168
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:05,880
where somebody was using a GRE tunnel to

1169
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,740
get to get bgp so they cut hop over

1170
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,970
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> access provided right and so one</font>

1171
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,919
of these packets went down this tunnel

1172
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:14,279
and you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so that</font>

1173
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,050
was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two encapsulations so you know</font>

1174
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,000
that's that's a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

1175
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,560
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> but both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these tunneling</font>

1176
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,410
techniques are designed for production

1177
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:28,440
use so next question Lee Howard<font color="#CCCCCC"> tumwater</font>

1178
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:31,080
cable thank you all like to see a lot

1179
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,390
more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Salah</font>

1180
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,850
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> airport extreme whatever that</font>

1181
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:37,770
box was called that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-end</font>

1182
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">box love to see it glad that you have in</font>

1183
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,670
now the product announcement forced it

1184
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:43,230
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> sports ipv6 anything on the lower</font>

1185
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:47,100
end of the spectrum that might support

1186
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:51,180
ipv6 for my cheaper customers likes me

1187
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:53,430
our cheaper customers okay well to

1188
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,990
answer that question first is that

1189
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:59,040
netgear has never been<font color="#CCCCCC"> known to be the</font>

1190
00:48:54,990 --> 00:49:00,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">cheapest product out there so with that</font>

1191
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,000
being said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we currently only have two</font>

1192
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:07,400
routers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adobe if you want specific</font>

1193
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,440
product numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> wnr 3500</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and wndr3700</font>

1194
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,240
one is version<font color="#CCCCCC"> two you'll see the new</font>

1195
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,600
firmware coming out within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next six</font>

1196
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,339
months it does not currently support<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1197
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in the future yes you will see the</font>

1198
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,230
astute products specifically drop down

1199
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:25,520
heavily in price so for the cheaper

1200
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,660
customers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be the solution</font>

1201
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,600
before somebody else steps in line I

1202
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:33,859
wanted to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> alan from cisco consumer</font>

1203
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:38,390
products form an enormous linksys on

1204
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:41,970
your list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cons 26 rd I did not see</font>

1205
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:43,830
have to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cpe the gateway</font>

1207
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:49,710
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably is to me and or my our</font>

1208
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:52,140
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's a pro for</font>

1209
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:54,090
you yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think replacing hardware is</font>

1210
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,980
probably a probe for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor of the</font>

1211
00:49:54,090 --> 00:50:00,590
hardware but not for the person who is

1212
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:03,450
buying new hardware sorry I'm good no se

1213
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,920
well replacement if you if it means a

1214
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:08,310
new service that's a good thing but I

1215
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,080
understand what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying but it's</font>

1216
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:12,210
hard for me to Brett my head on how

1217
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">sincerely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll knock the akhand put new</font>

1218
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:16,620
hardware if I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't say that if</font>

1219
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:19,589
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only feature that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1220
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:22,259
the box that's one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but but since</font>

1221
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,470
since it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be unlikely that that any</font>

1222
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,960
hardware vendor would have

1223
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:28,419
that'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the sole feature a reason to</font>

1224
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:34,060
replace the box i I just I can't see

1225
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a con gentleman in front here yeah</font>

products in the sub $99 range some sub

$49 as home router quote router devices

aren't you people making them

1246

00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:59,770
can volunteer to answer a little bit so

1250
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:03,400
so Jay what we ought to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I know</font>

1253
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:13,270
the back um the question is for someone

1254
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">who knows more about their product line</font>

1255

1269
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:05,290
computer is not reachable from the

1270
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:08,980
internet is a feature not a bug and I'm

1271
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:11,259
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> how ipv6 deployments</font>

1272
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:14,230
especially with the vision<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies</font>

1273
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:16,180
like Apple and netgear and everybody

1274
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,430
else of having these home devices that

1275
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:21,430
are once again internet reachable is

1276
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:24,399
going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mom security position</font>

1277
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">um hey so we took bets we took bets</font>

1278
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,339
whether this question will come up or

1279
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:31,900
not alright so let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah I can if</font>

1280
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:34,480
you don't mind acting something answer

1281
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:37,570
that so from a netgear perspective

1282
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,520
you're absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> right as you know as</font>

1283
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:42,730
you may know netgear is recently also

1284
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,530
enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security market so we enter</font>

1285
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,570
that in the service provider as well as

1286
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:48,600
the SMB business but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not ignoring</font>

1287
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:51,480
it in the home business at all

1288
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:54,330
I kind of alluded that a little earlier

1289
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,810
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at network</font>

1290
00:53:54,330 --> 00:54:00,330
security on a layered layered defense

1291
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:01,710
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the home and at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

1292
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:04,680
it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred percent</font>

1293
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:06,450
transparent as much as we can so that

1294
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,879
way when your mom or your grandma or

1295
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:10,980
your sister or your cousin buys a<font color="#E5E5E5"> neck</font>

1296
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,730
your product plugs it in they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1297
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,860
as secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they are today behind that</font>

1298
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:20,550
I'm not going to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are using</font>

1299
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:25,170
that or not going to use nap yet however

1300
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:29,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the main discussions is</font>

1301
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:32,910
how secure will ipv6 be without nap and

1302
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:34,590
is it and how how<font color="#E5E5E5"> resource intensive</font>

1303
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:36,629
will be tuned at it as well as that

1304
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:39,270
security or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it as well and add</font>

1305
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:43,920
security and make it 100 percent secure

1306
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:47,460
as well as seamless so why not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

1307
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,590
a firewall well you want to explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">my mom how to configure a firewall</font>

1309
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:56,340
that's the point it's one checkbox no

you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think the consumer you</font>

1319

automatically implement that in there

00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:24,030
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking then user whether they</font>

want the extra security or not they can

1322
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:28,200
uncheck it if they want sure we

1323
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:30,660
shouldn't ask them to check extra

1324
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:36,540
security if we know beforehand they will

1325
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:38,700
need it next question on the side on the

00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:56,189
interesting references to the use of

1336
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,270
assume just am I to be interested in

1337
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:12,360
whether or not Apple has some interest

1338
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,950
in supporting dhcpv6 because not only in

the home market is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that very important</font>

00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:18,600

for an internet draft in the v6 office

1410
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:12,259
working group called the ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cee simple</font>

1411
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:16,220
security draft which purports to explain

1412
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:19,010
in somewhat precise detail how you would

1413
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:21,680
go about implementing a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> stateful</font>

1414
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:26,530
firewall for residential gateways if

1415
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:29,299
you're interested in looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1416
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:33,020
equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that supposedly has a simple</font>

1417
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">security firewall compliance with that</font>

1418
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:37,730
draft when it's completed would probably

1419
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:40,700
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1420
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:42,590
basic idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this draft is it it</font>

1421
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">replicates all of the brokenness of NAT</font>

1422
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:47,030
without actually translating addresses

1423
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:49,040
if that's something that you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1424
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">need in order to keep your network safe</font>

1425
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,460
from the terrorists and the barbarians

1426
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:55,160
then

1427
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:57,940
that's what you should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I think</font>

1428
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,950
quite wisely suggests that you should

1429
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:04,040
allow certain specific security

1430
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:06,259
protocols inbound access to your network

1431
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,930
and it currently says that it should

1432
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:10,880
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ian internet key exchange IPSec</font>

1433
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:13,069
authenticated header and ipsec

1434
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:17,119
encapsulating security payload which

1435
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:18,560
should be allowed because those things

1436
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,589
are supposed to be secured by<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1437
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:25,160
means and we kind of made a decision in

1438
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:27,200
the design team to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow that but</font>

1439
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,319
vendors might want to even turn that off

1440
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,589
too so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the airport</font>

1441
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:35,900
products that i work on you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font>

1442
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:37,940
when you enable the ipv6 forwarding mode

1443
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,220
in any of its modes that it supports

1444
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:42,410
this there's a checkbox that you'll see

1445
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:45,020
that is the block incoming ipv6

1446
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:48,529
connections<font color="#E5E5E5"> checkbox it's enabled by</font>

1447
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:51,080
default and it tries to comply as

1448
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:53,390
closely as possible with this draft and

1449
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,250
the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you find that</font>

1450
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:56,960
it's breaking your app you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1451
01:00:55,250 --> 01:01:01,250
off or as you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn off an</font>

1452
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:04,250
ad so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap up here I have</font>

1453
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,810

1454
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,730
