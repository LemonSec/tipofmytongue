1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really interesting</font>

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,309
talks in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> research forum what I'm</font>

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,170
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do first is you know give a</font>

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,720
quick outline of what to expect from

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,119
this so I put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> some slides on</font>

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,549
what is the typical research forum what

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,720
is a typical research stock and I'm

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,070
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through these set of slides</font>

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,810
in five minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll start</font>

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,739
with the appearing talk or which is

12
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,738
going to be given by mark

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is a deck of slides I put</font>

14
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an idea</font>

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,010
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expect so we had a bunch of</font>

16
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:55,659
talks about ipv6 now how does the

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,539
researcher look at ipv6 is a typical

18
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:00,219
example okay obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need a</font>

19
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:01,659
motivation so what's the motivation we

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,839
are running out of bits this is a few

21
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:05,979
nanos ago when we had only three

22
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:07,479
characters for a s numbers so there was

23
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,509
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of confusion because Tom Shaw's</font>

24
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,070
from AT&T at seven oh one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a asst</font>

25
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:14,380
number so obviously running out of which

26
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,288
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so what do researchers do</font>

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,119
we look at public data from route views

28
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:22,179
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> etcetera write a bunch of scripts</font>

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,009
with no comments and use tremendous

30
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:25,869
personal bias in interpreting the

31
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,459
results so that's that's the theme of

32
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:29,799
the rest of the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to set</font>

33
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:31,479
this up front so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at route</font>

34
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:36,420
stability now what I'm trying to do here

35
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,420
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare ipv4 with ipv6 right and</font>

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:46,450
clearly i can see compared to 600 k

37
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:50,140
updates from ipv6 sources sorry beef v4

38
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,910
vs phi k from v6 clearly v6 is 120 times

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:57,099
more stable than before so that's

40
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,479
conclusion number one down time what we

41
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:00,250
do is we measure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total number of</font>

42
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,190
prefix downtime over a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-month period</font>

43
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we look at the number of v6 prefixes</font>

44
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,848
that have been down for more than one

45
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,799
day or more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 days right so</font>

46
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:15,280
numbers speak for themselves ipv4 is 80

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,800
times you know chance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> long time is 80</font>

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,519
times more than ipv6 so that's another

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,840
interesting result has security now in

50
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,209
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security it's a little more</font>

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,040
tricky we cannot really get a lot of

52
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:30,220
insight so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was I sent some</font>

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,200
surveys out and out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 service</font>

54
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked basically do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you lose sleep over</font>

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,170
ipv6 and none of them said they lose

56
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,330
sleep so obviously nobody loses sleep

57
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,329
over ipv6 security sir

58
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,170
now it's not enough to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,269
important it nobody loses sleep the next

60
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to answer is how much</font>

61
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,370
does it cost to secure v6 right and

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,440
again as a researcher we always looking

63
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,470
at different metrics to identify this

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,000
cost of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I try to contact the</font>

65
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,040
security people they wouldn't reply so

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,420
what I did was I went it went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon</font>

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,489
and looked at how much does it cost to

68
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:11,230
buy a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> on security and we can see</font>

69
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,900
from the sales rank that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only does</font>

70
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">it cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more to secure before but fewer</font>

71
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:21,190
people actually buy books to secure v6

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:25,360
so obviously v6 is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more secure by</font>

73
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:27,459
nature as a protocol so anyways I would

74
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,860
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop this and just set the theme</font>

75
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:33,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the rest of the session what I want</font>

76
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:36,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> elaborate from by these deck of</font>

77
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,200
slides is essentially there's a bunch of

78
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,970
researchers out here and what we really

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,488
need from you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a community as</font>

80
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,620
nano is the community's feedback and so

81
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,350
stay true<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the session and</font>

82
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,269
catch the individual speakers and some

83
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,430
of these speakers are coming up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

84
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:55,330
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time are very nervous talking</font>

85
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,280
in front of nanog so take a chance make

86
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,299
use of this opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grill them</font>

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,299
this should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

88
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,320
Thank smooth I feel a whole lot better

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,130
now and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raised the</font>

90
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">expectations for my talk really high so</font>

91
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,909
anyway thanks for being here everyone

92
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,430
and my name is a movie I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently at</font>

93
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,410
kada this is trying to work with

94
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,290
Constantine<font color="#E5E5E5"> vocalist at Georgia Tech and</font>

95
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah Francois at you see Logan and the</font>

96
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,560
talk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be about a value-based</font>

97
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,000
brain work for internet gearing so

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,890
clearly the motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk as</font>

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,450
like like more it said like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

100
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,490
researchers looking at the operational

101
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,530
community from the outside what we tend

102
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,570
to see is some amount of uncertainty

103
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,969
when it goes to negotiating<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering</font>

104
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,159
contacts for example who consider these

105
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,130
two networks a and B at some point they

106
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,080
decided to become settlements reappears

107
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,060
and eventually a one of these two

108
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,630
networks a starts wondering why is be

109
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,100
still a settlement free player maybe

110
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,070
start thinking does be actually benefit

111
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,630
more from this link than I do do I stood

112
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,830
should I actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind some</font>

113
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,020
sort of payment should have threatened

114
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,960
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> de Pierre the network if he doesn't</font>

115
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,049
pay me and so on and some of this

116
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,400
uncertainty<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably also extends to the</font>

117
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,680
case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> these two networks are not</font>

118
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,239
already peers so these two networks

119
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,160
don't currently have any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,990
business relationship but they're trying

121
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean one of them is thinking about</font>

122
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,390
say should I clear with the other

123
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,890
network or what kind of clearing should

124
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,280
this be should this be settlement free

125
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:51,430
where no one actually gets any money out

126
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:55,570
of it or should I should it be actually

127
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,160
appeared appearing relationship if this

128
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a paid clearing link then what sort</font>

129
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,240
of price should I be<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to offer to</font>

130
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,430
be and what sort of price would be we

131
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,900
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept in order to appeal</font>

132
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:10,000
with me so given<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of background</font>

133
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,219
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the outline of what I'm</font>

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present in this talk so i will</font>

135
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,460
briefly touch upon what we see as

136
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,040
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the real world in terms of</font>

137
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">pairing negotiations in pairing contacts</font>

138
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will propose what we call a</font>

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,990
appearing model called value-based

140
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,030
bearing and since i'm talking about

141
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,820
value for appearing link i'm going to go

142
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,380
into some details about how to

143
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,590
about estimating the value of appearing

144
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,760
link and finally I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclude by</font>

145
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,979
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to study some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the global</font>

146
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,570
effects of what you would likely to see

147
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,430
in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the global Internet if</font>

148
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,670
everyone were to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

149
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,250
value-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> being so what we see</font>

150
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:51,430
actually in the real world at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

151
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,590
looking at pairing rules of clearing

152
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,000
requirements online is this laundry list

153
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,549
of conditions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to</font>

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,470
specify as requirements for mostly for

155
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,480
settlement free clearing and some of

156
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,760
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things like traffic ratios</font>

157
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,250
minimum traffic requirements backbone

158
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,360
capacities the geographical spread that

159
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,730
networks have to sort of maintain and so

160
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,100
on and what it looks like is that these

161
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,710
are heuristics really to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the</font>

162
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,630
right set of networks in which but with

163
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,549
which it makes sense to exchange traffic

164
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,290
for free and I put free in codes because

165
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,500
of course even settlement free trading

166
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:28,780
incurs some some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cost but when</font>

167
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,910
it comes to paid pairing it gets a

168
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,440
little bit murkier what is what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

169
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,150
right price in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case so a price is</font>

170
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be exchanged on the link what</font>

171
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,349
is this right price and which<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

172
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be paying the other network</font>

173
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,280
further these sort of peering

174
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,840
requirements like I said which I let's

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,119
look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yur istics are they always</font>

176
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,159
applicable for example it seems that

177
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,870
many many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

178
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,120
requirements some links<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

179
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:56,470
mutually beneficial might actually not

180
00:07:52,120 --> 00:08:01,060
get formed and this seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

181
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:03,160
seems problematic so what we propose is

182
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,650
this method<font color="#CCCCCC"> of peering core value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> base</font>

183
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">pairing so we assume that this is not</font>

184
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,909
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> a settlement free painting</font>

185
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,770
link you can have a price being

186
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,270
exchanged on this link and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price</font>

187
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,810
should depend on the value of the link

188
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to both of these bearing parties so</font>

189
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,070
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this value for a network</font>

190
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,870
let's say we define the notion of

191
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,900
fitness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fitness</font>

192
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,420
in in economic terms so<font color="#E5E5E5"> fern for a</font>

193
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,510
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that say an ISP you it has a</font>

194
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,250
revenue it incurs some costs in these

195
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,349
costs are interconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs to connect</font>

196
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,260
to its transit its own transit providers

197
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,969
or to other settlement free peers and it

198
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,159
incurs a cost a backhaul<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost without</font>

199
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,880
traffic on its own network so the

200
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,760
fitness is simply the revenue

201
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,200
I interconnect minus the backhaul costs

202
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,270
and now suppose you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a certain</font>

203
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,530
fitness with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering link and you</font>

204
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,329
have a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> fitness without the</font>

205
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,339
bearing link it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple that the</font>

206
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,680
value of the link to this network is

207
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,900
simply the difference of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two</font>

208
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">witnesses and the important thing to</font>

209
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">note</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that in the case that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

210
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,110
the link and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have the link all</font>

211
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:10,460
three of these terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> are contribute to</font>

212
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,140
fitness could actually change so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

213
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,330
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a little bit of detail</font>

214
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,550
here so let us take this example of two

215
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,220
networks a and B<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're currently not</font>

216
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,670
peers they're exchanging traffic via

217
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,980
this transit provider t so let us

218
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,089
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first case that like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

219
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,310
they are exchanging traffic through this

220
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,860
transit provider so they both play the

221
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,020
transit provider and when they actually

222
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to form peering link this traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

223
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,250
going to bypass the transit provider so

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,220
clearly there save this amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

225
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:42,080
same some amount of transit costs I also

226
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,450
notice that when traffic ships on the

227
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,210
transit provider to this direct clearing

228
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,520
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the traffic flow inside each</font>

229
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,700
network also changes so this probably

230
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:58,370
also changes the backhaul<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs at both</font>

231
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,720
a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> B are now incurring finally due to</font>

232
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,520
the formation of this clearing link

233
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,410
traffic would be diverted such that the

234
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,420
revenue for one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these one or both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

235
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,880
these networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually change so</font>

236
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,560
let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how that could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen suppose</font>

237
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,160
you have a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's downstream of</font>

238
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,180
a somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in its customer cone and</font>

239
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,130
initially when there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no peering link</font>

240
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">its routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic that actually</font>

241
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually reaches be but it doesn't</font>

242
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:24,620
cross a at all now suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a and B</font>

243
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,480
actually clear this network that's

244
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,000
downstream of a now sees the shorter

245
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,330
path and starts routing traffic through

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,890
a now since this is a customer I I hope

247
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get paid for this</font>

248
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,900
traffic and so actually it's revvin you

249
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,460
might actually increase so essentially

250
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,980
what i showed here is that all the three

251
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,470
terms are contribute to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fitness of a</font>

252
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,090
network could actually change depending

253
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">on whether the link appearing link in</font>

254
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:54,890
this case is present or not so suppose

255
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oracle or a third party or a</font>

256
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,350
mediator that knows the value of the

257
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:03,020
link for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a and B for both a and B so a</font>

258
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we have actually I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

259
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">information to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle now the Oracle</font>

260
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,330
must decide what sort of price should be

261
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,980
exchanged on this link<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the if you</font>

262
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,230
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it the fair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> price if the</font>

263
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,290
value for of the link for a is V<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

264
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,910
and the value for B is VB then the fair

265
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:24,829
price is<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply half of the difference</font>

266
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:27,110
between VA and VB so the Oracle would

267
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,730
say that these networks should care and

268
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,470
age should be paying be half of the

269
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,270
difference assume here for simplicity

270
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,400
that the value of a is greater<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the</font>

271
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">value so the direction of payment is</font>

272
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,650
from A to B and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to see</font>

273
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,720
that this price is fair in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

274
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,920
that it equalizes the benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both</font>

275
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,630
a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> B are going to see from the link</font>

276
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you there is this notion of</font>

277
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,720
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fair price that would</font>

278
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,630
equalize the benefit for both networks

279
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,170
but why would these two net was actually

280
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,700
agreed to appear at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this price so what</font>

281
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,349
we show in the in this in this paper

282
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,630
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that peering with the fair</font>

283
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,460
price is<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimal in the sense that both</font>

284
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,860
networks would actually see better

285
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,620
fitness by peering at this pairing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

286
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,080
exchanging this price as opposed to the

case<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fear at all</font>

288
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,310
further we show that this fair price

289
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,319
actually lies in a region which in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

290
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,900
it is stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a unique Nash</font>

291
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,280
equilibrium in this in the sense that no

292
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,410
network has the incentive to

293
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,569
unilaterally depere the other network so

294
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,800
once these two networks from the

295
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,540
clearing link and exchange the price

296
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,400
they don't have to worry about whether

297
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,870
one of them should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> r</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

298
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,850
other or not of course an important

299
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,190
condition for the optimality and

300
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:43,310
stability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold is that the aggregate</font>

301
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:46,610
value of the link so VA plus vb has to

302
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:48,319
be greater than 0 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this will bring</font>

303
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,350
this up again later because it turns out

304
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,540
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be important but note that the</font>

305
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,950
aggregate value VA plus vb has to be

306
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,589
greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 but this doesn't imply</font>

307
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:01,430
that both VA and<font color="#CCCCCC"> VB have to be positive</font>

308
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,930
so contrast this with a cost-benefit

309
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">pairing we're both networks are trying</font>

310
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,670
to pair only if it makes sense for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

311
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,100
in which case both VA and VB have to be

312
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,559
greater than 0

313
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,779
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean to have se- peering</font>

314
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,100
value and why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks still</font>

315
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,199
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appear even if they have</font>

316
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,389
negative carrying value so let us<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

317
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,740
simple example here and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

318
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,529
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw out some hypothetical numbers</font>

319
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,569
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider networks a and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> B they</font>

320
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,329
currently don't have any peering link

321
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:33,209
and the fitness of a is this

322
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:36,359
hypothetical number 50 k and the fitness

323
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:39,508
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> B is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 k now suppose they actually</font>

324
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,910
form this pairing link the fitness of a

325
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,490
might increase and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to 60 k while the</font>

326
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,699
fitness of B might decrease and go to 95

327
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:51,899
k but this implies is that the value of

328
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:55,559
a for this fading link is a 10k and the

329
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:57,360
value of B<font color="#CCCCCC"> is negative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's minus 5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> K so</font>

330
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,209
what our fair peering proposal would

331
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,279
suggest here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the value of</font>

332
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:03,839
a is greater<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the value of B these</font>

333
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,819
two networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> would appear and a should</font>

334
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,569
exchange half of the difference in this

335
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:11,430
case that's seven and a half K now if

336
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:14,550
you look look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this what happens is</font>

337
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,849
after this payment has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been exchanged</font>

338
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,859
the fitness of a is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to fifty</font>

339
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,439
two and a half and the fitness of B is

340
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,879
going to go to 102 and a half and if you

341
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:26,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at what the fitness is where before</font>

342
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pairing link existed both are doing</font>

343
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,529
better now so it's clear that even

344
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,999
though one network was actually had a

345
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,069
negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> value for the bearing link</font>

346
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,720
these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks should actually be</font>

347
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:38,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">peering and exchanging this price and</font>

348
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:45,029
it's in there both better off in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

349
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:47,490
case so I so far a talk in very abstract

350
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,740
terms about these values a and B VA and

351
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,569
VB but how do these networks actually go

352
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,449
about measuring these values how do you

353
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:57,979
come up with VA and VB so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume</font>

354
00:14:54,449 --> 00:15:00,149
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have peering plans and</font>

355
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,920
initially there is no no pairing link

356
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,319
but these two networks say temporarily

357
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,479
set up a clearing link and during the

358
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:08,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">course of this pairing trial they</font>

359
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">collect various types of data like</font>

360
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,480
NetFlow data and routing data and so on

361
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and presumably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they know their own</font>

362
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,720
topology they know their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

363
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,920
structures they know who their transit

364
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,309
providers are and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much they're</font>

365
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">charging them so it's it's reasonable to</font>

366
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:24,620
assume that with peering<font color="#E5E5E5"> files a and B</font>

367
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,830
can actually measure their own value for

368
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing link reasonably well but</font>

369
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,710
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be pretty hard for a to</font>

370
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,900
accurately measure the value of the

371
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,940
other network so is going to not be able

372
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure V be very accurately and vice</font>

373
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,310
versa so<font color="#E5E5E5"> given that the network can't</font>

374
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,680
actually estimate the value for the

375
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,569
other network is let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if</font>

376
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,400
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is any value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a network trying</font>

377
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,470
to understate or hide its bearing value

378
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,160
so let's take another simple example

379
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:55,190
here assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the true total</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value of</font>

380
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,290
this link VA and VA plus vb is positive

381
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,300
so this link is actually feasible and it

382
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,670
would be stable and optimal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on</font>

383
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,310
and for simplicity let's assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vb</font>

384
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">is greater than V a so be gains more</font>

385
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:10,459
from this linkedin a and according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

386
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:14,060
our fair price is a should be getting

387
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,910
paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> VB minus VA by 2 now let's say that</font>

388
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,280
a has a good estimate of how much the

389
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,020
link means for B and retries to

390
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,300
understate or hydrates<font color="#CCCCCC"> bearing value it</font>

391
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,490
gets greedy and it claims<font color="#E5E5E5"> its bearing</font>

392
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,150
value is VL<font color="#E5E5E5"> the VL is much much less</font>

393
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">than se va now if be actually buys this</font>

394
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,069
and agrees with this claim then p is

395
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,320
going to be willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay more it's</font>

396
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:39,040
going to pay vb minus v l by 2 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a is</font>

397
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,410
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy essentially it's</font>

398
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's cheated in some sense but the</font>

399
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,760
important condition here is that a has

400
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,160
to have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate estimate of these</font>

401
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,400
value and if it doesn't do this well and

402
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,740
the aggregate value now VL plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> vb</font>

403
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,120
becomes negative then this bearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font>

404
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,280
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to be feasible anymore</font>

405
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,710
because like i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier for the</font>

406
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,400
peering link to be stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aggregate</font>

407
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,140
value of the link has to be positive so

408
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this case by trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cheat is going</font>

409
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,700
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose out on any sort of</font>

410
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,610
payment at all and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that</font>

411
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:16,640
raises is that does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk of losing</font>

412
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:18,679
out on all payment actually create some

413
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,660
sort of incentive been trying to in

414
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:25,970
disclosing the true value for P earrings

415
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:28,430
so all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some pretty hard</font>

416
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,440
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't have the answers</font>

417
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">to all of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope some of you will</font>

418
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,850
be able to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me answer them so the</font>

419
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,580
first and foremost thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I propose</font>

420
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,409
this thing

421
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,300
the spice which is fair and optimal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

422
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,890
stable but is there actually an

423
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:46,919
incentive to be fair in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world</font>

424
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:49,080
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> not then yeah then I don't know that</font>

425
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,210
second can a network actually try to

426
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,530
estimate its own value for appearing

427
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,960
link without undergoing this whole

428
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,700
process of setting up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bearing link</font>

429
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,270
going through peering<font color="#E5E5E5"> trials collecting</font>

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,370
loads and loads of data and so on and

431
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,200
this is something actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

432
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,810
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we have an ongoing</font>

433
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,960
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and perhaps at the next man log</font>

434
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:12,419
I might have some results the third

435
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,010
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is can a network i estimate the</font>

436
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,150
value of a pairing link for a potential

437
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:19,560
or even a current peer and thinking

438
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

439
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,030
don't know if there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> even any hope for</font>

440
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,560
a network try to accurately estimate how

441
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:29,190
much the other network benefits from

442
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,570
appearing link and lastly something that

443
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,940
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interested in what are the sort</font>

444
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,290
of global effects of value-based plating

445
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">what if everyone in the internet was</font>

446
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,350
trying to clear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way and and what</font>

447
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,940
would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to various global matrix so</font>

448
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,260
the last thing is something that again

449
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,740
we are working on and I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> present</font>

450
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:51,240
some early results from from there so

451
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,680
like I said we would like to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

452
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,440
study what are the global effects of

453
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,820
value-based bearing and clearly for this

454
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,410
sort of thing we need a model we need a

455
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,590
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> for essentially the entire</font>

456
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,600
internet ecosystem and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

457
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:07,199
what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to try to build here</font>

458
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,639
so as presumably networks are trying to

459
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,710
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> the providers and peers to</font>

460
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,110
optimize a certain objective function

461
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,850
right and this objective function is

462
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,709
probably different for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> network out</font>

463
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,719
there so for a transit provider it

464
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,330
should be profit for a content provider

465
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,800
it might be performance for a stub

466
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,310
network at the edge it might simply be

467
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,750
minimizing costs so what we're

468
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,820
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what are the effects of</font>

469
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,920
these sort of provider and<font color="#CCCCCC"> p.s</font>

470
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,189
collection strategies on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the</font>

471
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,390
networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually do these things</font>

472
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,430
further what are the effects of these

473
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,590
strategies on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the global internet</font>

474
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,390
as a whole so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the sense of how does a</font>

475
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,449
topology look like when everyone does

476
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,010
this how does traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow what are the</font>

477
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,650
economics like which provide does make

478
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,770
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> whisper</font>

479
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,300
lose money and how does performance look

480
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:56,170
like in terms of end-to-end<font color="#E5E5E5"> path length</font>

481
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:58,210
say and some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

482
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,640
would try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer was can be predict</font>

483
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,410
what would happen if say everyone in the

484
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,430
internet was trying to do fare paid

485
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:08,620
peering so our approach to trying to

486
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,690
answer these sort of what if questions

487
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,739
is through this this model which we call

488
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:16,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">iter and what this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially an</font>

489
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,680
agent-based model that tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer</font>

490
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">these sort of what if questions about</font>

491
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,990
internet evolution and it has mean it's

492
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,280
a highly parameterize model so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

493
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,110
various inputs which we try to

494
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,050
parameterize according to the best data

495
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,429
we have available so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have different</font>

496
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,110
types of networks we have transit

497
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,720
providers we model content providers

498
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">stubs we model different peer and</font>

499
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,440
provide a selection strategies for each

500
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,080
of these networks we model the presence

501
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,960
of geographical constraints we have

502
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,240
pricing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost parameters and we have</font>

503
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,600
an avi model and some sort of estimate

504
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,040
of the interdomain traffic matrix and

505
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,990
given all these inputs what this model

506
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,379
essentially splits out is an equilibrium

507
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,960
internet work so we have an internetwork

508
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,440
topology we have how the traffic flows

509
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:08,080
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this topology and this gives us power</font>

510
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network fitness in terms of economics so</font>

511
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we actually come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with this</font>

512
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,190
equilibrium is as follows and

513
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't point here but so</font>

514
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,430
essentially you start with this inter

515
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,830
domain topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is the leftmost</font>

516
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:23,140
block there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> together with the</font>

517
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,330
traffic matrix and routing policies are

518
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,000
going to determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> how traffic actually</font>

519
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,520
flows in the internet now traffic flow

520
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,100
is going to determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> / network fitness</font>

521
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,290
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense which providers make how</font>

522
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">much money how much costs they incur and</font>

523
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,510
so on networks are going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

524
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,670
optimize their fitness or minimize the

525
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,250
cost or whatever by appropriately

526
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,960
choosing the providers in PS this

527
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,760
process feeds back into the topology

528
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,800
because the topology changes when

529
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,520
someone changes their providers appears

530
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,960
and this process keeps repeating

531
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,168
essentially until we reach a state where

532
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,179
no network has any incentive to

533
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:02,159
make any further changes in its

534
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,590
connectivity and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

535
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,480
equilibrium and once we've actually

536
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,809
computed this<font color="#E5E5E5"> equilibrium iteratively</font>

537
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,519
which is why we call this model<font color="#CCCCCC"> lighter</font>

538
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,320
we can measure the topological and

539
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,389
economic properties of this resulting

540
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,100
equilibrium and we can measure things

541
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:19,649
like how do the path lengths look like

542
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,019
we can measure economics which<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

543
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:23,609
us seem to be profitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> which networks</font>

544
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:27,919
tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair with which other networks</font>

545
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:31,590
and so on so what we did was actually

546
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,210
used this model this this we built a

547
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,488
simulator for this model and we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

548
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,549
to simulate value-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> bearing among</font>

549
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:40,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">many other things so unfortunately this</font>

550
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:41,549
model is pretty computationally

551
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:43,259
expensive so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run it at the</font>

552
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,649
scale of the internet not at the scale

553
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:48,509
of 34,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> a esas for sure but we we have</font>

554
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">a small but realistic internetwork</font>

555
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:52,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">topology and we can model different</font>

556
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:55,259
types of networks transit providers

557
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,940
content providers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stubs we</font>

558
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,369
parameterize an inter domain traffic

matrix which currently at in the current

560
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:02,789
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the model is is dominated by</font>

562
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:07,850
providers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stubb's we model various</font>

563
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:10,049
different provider selection methods but

564
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,519
eventually we stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> with just price</font>

565
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:14,009
based providers selection so everyone

566
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:17,159
chooses the cheapest providers we model

567
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:18,749
various for peer selection methods one

568
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,999
of them which is the one which i just

569
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:23,070
presented the other one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost-benefit</font>

570
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:25,230
the base pairing where two networks

<font color="#E5E5E5">appear only if they both see a benefit</font>

00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:45,029
peering in using this model what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

579
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:46,950
is that compared to cost benefit or

580
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:48,749
traffic ratio based bearing you'll see a

581
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,519
much higher density of pairing links

582
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:52,499
when everyone is doing value-based

583
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,200
bearing and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

584
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:57,480
hard to see why I mean links that are

585
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,639
not allowed with traffic creation of a

586
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,139
cost-benefit clearing actually become

587
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:03,418
possible with value-based bearing

588
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:05,969
because simply because a payment can now

589
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:09,029
be exchanged in terms of payment

590
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,190
direction we studied in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> equilibrium</font>

591
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network which networks tend to pay with</font>

592
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,240
other networks and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font>

593
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,550
the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we found was that</font>

594
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,590
content providers can be on both sides

595
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:23,790
of this paid fearing relationship

596
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:25,770
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they end up paying typically</font>

597
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that larger transit providers while they</font>

598
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,800
actually get paid by smaller transit

599
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,490
providers and I would be very interested

600
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with folks here and see if you</font>

601
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">have insights about whether this is</font>

602
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening already in the internet and</font>

603
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,370
finally like I said incorrect estimation

604
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,550
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing value especially for the</font>

605
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:47,159
other network can actually preclude the

606
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,750
formation of links that would be

607
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,020
mutually beneficial so again there is an

608
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:53,790
incentive to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to share the correct</font>

609
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,840
value for the appearing link with the

610
00:24:53,790 --> 00:25:00,210
potential pier so<font color="#E5E5E5"> needless to say we</font>

611
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,919
need feedback on on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

612
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,830
model on this value based framework

613
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,570
which I proposed and some of some

614
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:10,260
examples on how you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

615
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,000
help us so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example how much per side</font>

616
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,930
goes into provided and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pa selection</font>

617
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">decisions so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while trying to form a</font>

618
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,140
pairing relationship doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

619
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,750
actually think what its customers would

620
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,530
do how his customers might change their

621
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:27,090
routing change in the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on</font>

622
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,649
again insights about how paid peering

623
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,379
negotiations happen in the real world

624
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:34,170
would definitely help us inform this

625
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">model much better and finally about this</font>

last piece this<font color="#E5E5E5"> item model that are</font>

627
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:41,399

00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,260
parameterize model the the whether or

<font color="#E5E5E5">not the output makes sense depends to a</font>

630
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,170
large extent on whether the input is

631
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,670
realistic so we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if you</font>

632
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,470
would be willing to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> data with us</font>

633
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,510
to help us parameterize this model

634
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,920
better that would be awesome and the

635
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,650
kind of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

636
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,050
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us is any sort of traffic data or</font>

pricing or cost parameters or things

638
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:08,220
like that so that's pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

639
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,440
thanks for listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can find</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">much so I think we have time for one</font>

645
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,810
quick question if somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

646
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:34,289
hi I'm Nina from CDC um I was just

647
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:35,940
wondering if first of all i really like

648
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:37,799
a model thank you for doing it I've been

649
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,350
looking for people who would do this for

650
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,480
a couple of years I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what</font>

651
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:47,279
famous theory is about but I have

652
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,730
hearing as my day job and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would love</font>

653
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">to share our data with you by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way uh</font>

654
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:55,379
what I wonder is do you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

655
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:59,820
model could you know turn into something

656
00:26:55,379 --> 00:27:02,820
operational for somebody like me or is

657
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,269
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> more a view of the whole peering</font>

658
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,490
Echosong system so we can all have just

659
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:11,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">an idea what happens globally but not</font>

660
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,649
from my own little<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me let</font>

661
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,690
me add a little bit to that question I

662
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:17,399
guess one other thing I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font>

663
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,320
was is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this something you see as a</font>

664
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:21,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-time thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which people do or is</font>

665
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:25,259
this an ongoing process which you can

666
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:27,899
use right so to answer your question

667
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:29,700
first if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the second point</font>

668
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:33,119
here right one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are working</font>

669
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,700
on is a sort of a broader thing called

670
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:40,499
like a cost model that networks could

671
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:43,919
use to try to come up to determine

672
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:46,230
peering value for potential or current

673
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,019
peering links and this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

674
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:52,440
could be very useful for sort of

675
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:53,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">day-to-day up the operations of a nice</font>

676
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,669
being trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine costs and time</font>

677
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:00,450
to find the right set of peers as far as

678
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:04,110
your other question about this this sort

679
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:09,059
of model I believe it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of more</font>

680
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:12,389
general utility in the sense that it can

681
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:14,908
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how should I put it can help</font>

682
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:19,320
us sort of try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to predict what is what</font>

683
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:21,179
what's likely to happen if players in

684
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,970
this ecosystem are going to do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

685
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,009
a certain way so it I think it can help

686
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,590
in sort of long-term strategizing about

687
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:31,500
provider and PS election

688
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:34,500
our decisions but I mean the role of

689
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> model is not to sort of predict</font>

690
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,390
which sort exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network you should go</font>

691
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,029
and clear with but given<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain class</font>

692
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:44,039
of peering policies that you have time

693
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:47,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> predict what's what's likely to be</font>

694
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:50,549
your fate essentially so nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font>

695
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">among next we have cassie presenting</font>

who are at the back rows you might have

a slight problem looking at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

702
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,309
interested in and scared about DNS SEC I

703
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:17,960
would encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up a little</font>

704
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:17,960
bit which one is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a secret</font>

705
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,720
alright well thank you this pleasure to

706
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,820
be here if I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> known a little</font>

707
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit more about the research forum and</font>

708
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,409
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mohit slide it ahead of time I</font>

709
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:40,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have biased my slides a little bit</font>

710
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:44,340
more but here we are so I'll go ahead

711
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,760
and go forward so has anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried DNS</font>

712
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:51,659
SEC yet anyone signed their zones anyone

713
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,690
validate anyone elses owns good any of

714
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,280
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience any problems oh good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

715
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:01,410
so there would be a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people listening</font>

716
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:03,418
then so um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this will be</font>

717
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,790
interesting so I'm part of the

718
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:08,820
motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this came earlier in the</font>

719
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,899
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> year we started we decided to</font>

720
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,059
follow the lead of some of the others

721
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,309
that were actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing validation we</font>

722
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:18,240
have signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> our zones in fall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of last</font>

723
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:19,379
year at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandia gov and and decided to</font>

724
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,600
follow the lead to some others in

725
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,580
actually doing some validation but I set

726
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,159
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in such a way that we could</font>

727
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting data for the</font>

728
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,799
responses that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were failing and I was</font>

729
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,510
surprised at the number of failures that

730
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,840
have come in the first couple weeks of

731
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and as we troubleshot these we</font>

732
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,399
realized that the symptoms and and the

733
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,679
causes were all over the map I mean it

734
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:47,669
wasn't just consistently inspired

735
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,380
signatures or or DNS Keys missing or

736
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:53,010
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was it was really</font>

737
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,559
pretty crazy and so in some of the

738
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,690
research I was doing I decided to

739
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,700
integrate tool to do some visualization

740
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,890
to help administrators understand what's

741
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,980
going on and to diagnose particular

742
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:08,309
problems that were happening so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

743
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:11,280
old day is right we do a dig and we get

744
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:14,879
back a nice response it's fairly concise

745
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:17,910
and we can read it we add in DNS SEC and

746
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,059
we get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more data a lot of it which</font>

747
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,799
we can't do much with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> RI and we</font>

748
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,870
need tools to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do something</font>

749
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,720
reasonable with it the one thing that we

750
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:30,479
can as at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least as a sub resolver do is</font>

751
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,480
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> our we can use this authenticated</font>

752
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,610
data bit the ad bit that's set here to

753
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,590
let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that the resolver was able</font>

754
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:42,090
to validate it

755
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:43,290
so I'm but with the rest of it you know

756
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">we just kind of have to take for granted</font>

757
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,950
at least with our naked eye<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font>

758
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happens when something goes wrong</font>

759
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,280
that's where it becomes fairly

760
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,830
problematic because what we get is a

761
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">surveil message which could be DNS SEC</font>

762
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,980
related it could be some other name

763
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:00,510
resolution error that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we come across</font>

764
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take this particular</font>

765
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:07,650
example that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> WWE</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Medicare</font>

766
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:10,850
gov back in April and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull out our</font>

767
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:13,470
handy troubleshooting tool dig we might

768
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:15,600
carefully craft a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> well directed</font>

769
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:18,360
queries and get something like the

770
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,590
following from<font color="#E5E5E5"> which if we look through</font>

771
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the numbers I've highlighted some of</font>

772
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:25,889
which might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> handy we might deduce</font>

773
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:27,389
that the problem is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> d/s is</font>

774
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,340
referencing a key that does not exist

775
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:33,120
and therefore our chain of trust is

776
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,429
broken further straightforward right but

777
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,790
quite of information pardon<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pun to</font>

778
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,680
dig through so one of the other

779
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,139
difficult things in looking at this is

780
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some attributes that are</font>

781
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,540
associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS keys but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the real</font>

782
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,040
world these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the typical</font>

783
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,260
case that we might find which is

784
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">illustrated here in this graphic where</font>

785
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,660
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single zone signing key a key</font>

786
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:59,820
signing key which also acts as the set

787
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and even in in the case of</font>

788
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,399
revocation we see cases where they don't

789
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">always follow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pattern in other words</font>

790
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,970
the revoke bit is is set but not

791
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:15,000
necessarily self-signed which / RFC 50

792
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:18,630
11 means that it isn't fully validated

793
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,240
as revoked<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

794
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:24,510
consider as we begin our DNS SEC

795
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,920
troubleshooting<font color="#E5E5E5"> journey now there are</font>

796
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:30,210
some other tools out there I've just

797
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:33,390
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a few extensions here too well</font>

798
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:36,210
built in<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dig extension to dig a cig</font>

799
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,790
chase and then built in to drill our son

800
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:42,450
methods these are good methods and very

801
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:44,909
powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also textual and more</font>

802
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:48,020
catered towards advanced users okay so

803
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:50,870
on to visualization

804
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,540
okay the tool is<font color="#CCCCCC"> available online at DNS</font>

805
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:58,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">viz net and this is a little bit of a</font>

806
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:59,629
screenshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so to show a little bit</font>

807
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,690
about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the components that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

808
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">use for this for those haven't seen this</font>

809
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:06,820
basically constructing an authentication

810
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:08,899
graph with nodes and directed edges and

811
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,600
here are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the meanings of some of</font>

812
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:14,060
those nodes so we have domain names DNS

813
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,049
key and Dee Dee's resource records which

814
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:20,418
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown with an elliptical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shapes node</font>

815
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,429
and then the nodes are decorated based

816
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:24,020
on their attributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if the set</font>

817
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">did is set for example it's filled in</font>

818
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,259
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray if the revoke bit is set</font>

819
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:32,589
you're going to have a darker shade

820
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:35,120
shaded border if it's published only

821
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,429
then you've got a dashed line dash

822
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,980
border that's missing altogether but

823
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:42,560
referenced<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere it's going to be</font>

824
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,090
red Phil and then if it's a if it's

825
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,830
acting as trust anchor which I'll show

826
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,419
you in just a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's going to</font>

827
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:52,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">be have a double border and then finally</font>

828
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:55,009
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a just to explain this this</font>

829
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:58,160
insect type node this<font color="#E5E5E5"> diamond shape node</font>

830
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:01,280
this is for whores owns that are signed

831
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,790
but have insecure delegations this

832
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,540
particular node is used to represent the

833
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:11,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">N sec one or in some cases to that</font>

834
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,520
repudiate the existence of DS type

835
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:17,870
resource records which effectively prove

836
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,570
that it's an insecure delegation so now

837
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,730
here where we put in the relationships

838
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,780
between these particular nodes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

839
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:28,190
we have alias dependencies show up here

840
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,130
signatures or digests or directed edges

841
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,740
between nodes and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> color represents</font>

842
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:37,370
the status of the signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> or digest so</font>

843
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:42,020
whether it's valid bogus or expired<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

844
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:44,210
we're also overlaying the zones on top

845
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,150
of these other nodes the DNS keys and

846
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:49,370
other resource records and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

847
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:52,220
how that goes but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the two the</font>

848
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:54,140
different zones the delegations

849
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,660
represented as either secure broken

850
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,150
insecure or misconfigured and then

851
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally with regard to the insect type</font>

852
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:05,720
nodes that I explained earlier

853
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:09,020
the nodes going into those show if it's

854
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,720
a the color shows whether it's an

855
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:14,540
effective or ineffective proof of

856
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,310
insecure delegation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then the</font>

857
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,020
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the outline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the actual</font>

859
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell us whether something is secure</font>

860
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,870
bogus or insecure based on tracing it

861
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:32,629
from the trust anchor down going through

862
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:34,359
the various DNS SEC rules ok so we

863
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:38,090
revisit our previous example

864
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:41,150
medicare.gov and we confirm our

865
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,610
suspicions that in fact there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dds</font>

866
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:47,480
type resource record for<font color="#CCCCCC"> medicare gov</font>

867
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:50,300
that it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not match up with any DNS</font>

868
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,560
key which now if you can follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

869
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:56,830
show you a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on this while I</font>

870
00:36:51,560 --> 00:37:00,860
have it up but up the pointer

871
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:04,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see it ok so up here at the top is</font>

872
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:07,970
the trust anchor which by default I'm a

873
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:12,650
I'm actually anchoring with the ISC d lv

874
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:14,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">trustee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a deal v service and then that</font>

875
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,890
gets traced down here so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

876
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,330
these are trusted until this point at

877
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:21,549
which point the nose down here in the

878
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:25,069
medicare.gov zone are in fact broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

879
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:27,530
now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some options in the dns is</font>

881
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,120
so over in the there's a pulldown menu

882
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:35,150
which you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually change the</font>

883
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">supported algorithms as well as put in</font>

884
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,380
your own trust anchor so in this case

885
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,420
you'll see that the the visualization

886
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,920
actually changes when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> only support</font>

887
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,390
algorithms one and and five here and and

888
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,500
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> this changes things to an</font>

889
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:54,470
insecure result because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns keys</font>

890
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:57,050
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gov's own our algorithm type 7</font>

891

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now unsupported according to</font>

892
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:02,300
this so and then we see what happens if

893
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:05,390
we were to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the trust anchors if</font>

894
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,800
we don't anchor with d lv anymore and we

895
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:09,230
add our own trust anchor to medicare.gov

896
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,900
things look just fine even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

897
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:13,670
broken above medicare<font color="#E5E5E5"> gov because we've</font>

898
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,840
changed the view a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

899
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,440
kind of shows how you can play with

900
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,599
things a little

901
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,960
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your own view if you'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

902
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:25,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more specific or</font>

903
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,230
flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to run through</font>

904
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,000
a few more examples and I haven't taken

905
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:34,430
any provisions to anonymize any of this

906
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:37,040
data so just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference okay so</font>

907
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,629
here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a again I talked</font>

908
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,069
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these DNS key roles we might</font>

909
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,660
typically see so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just showing some</font>

910
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:44,569
various examples of how things show up

911
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,520
here so in this particular case this

912
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:49,700
zone the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot new zone is signed with a</font>

913
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:53,210
single key which is functioning both as

914
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:56,118
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zs k the k sk and also the step</font>

915
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:03,230
because it provides secure entry from is

916
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:05,869
CS d<font color="#CCCCCC"> lb ok moving on this is another</font>

917
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,339
example there are two keys here but in

918
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:11,329
fact both of these are registered which

919
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:13,160
is perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> legitimate as as secure</font>

920
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:17,180
entry points into this zone which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

921
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:21,950
fedora hosted org and you can see I'm

922
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:26,598
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the dot org zone that it dot</font>

923
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:30,770
org makes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA's repudiates proves</font>

924
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:34,369
that it's an unsecure delegation but of

925
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">course you have the the delegation if</font>

you will into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISC d lv the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

928
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,369
mention is up at the top you can see the

929
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:50,569
ders for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root which of course shows</font>

930
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:52,490
bogus signatures<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok this is an example</font>

931
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:55,220
of something we've seen we're on

932
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,540
different servers authoritative servers

933
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,848
for a particular zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually get</font>

934
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,920
different results I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

935
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:02,420
cause of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular one is I have a</font>

936
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,670
feeling it's a load balancer have you

937
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,500
seen several of those but one of them is

938
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,760
actually one of the server serves a

939
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,030
bogus signature the other one is

940
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,730
legitimate which is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

941
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,690
even though they both both servers are

942
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:22,220
serving the same serial here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

943
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:24,829
example and this one is similar except

944
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,750
that the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them is serving an</font>

945
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:28,020
expired result and I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling this</font>

946
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,370
is probably because

947
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,650
they might be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the tools</font>

948
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:33,359
such as DNA six signs own but maybe

949
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,040
didn't increment their<font color="#E5E5E5"> cereal the</font>

950
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,960
secondary never pulled it down just a

951
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,730
guess I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any confirmation on</font>

952
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,400
that but it's just to give the

953
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:45,840
administrator an idea that a one of your

954
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:49,110
services serving bad data<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here's</font>

955
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,730
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a revoked DNS key</font>

956
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,590
looks like so you can see by the dark

957
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:56,580
outline that the revoke bit is set and

958
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:58,890
then there's a self loop on the key

959
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:02,900
itself to show that it's that it's also

960
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,900
signing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS key resource record set</font>

961
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:13,440
so this one came out what last weekend

962
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:15,510
about a week<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> darpa the</font>

963
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,240
signature expired as you can see here

964
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:21,590
and the repercussions are shown in that

965
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:25,049
from the key where the missing signature

966
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:28,880
takes place up at the top there on down

967
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:32,100
it affects the zones below it because

968
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,560
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chain down now the N SEC</font>

969
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,540
record is no longer valid which means

970
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that even the unsigned zones below it</font>

971
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,200
were affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by this now unless there</font>

972
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,540
was some other anchor down below which

973
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,649
is the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some zones this is an</font>

974
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:52,200
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how this goes down the graph</font>

975
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:53,790
to to show what is affected<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's</font>

976
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">another example of expired signatures</font>

977
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,120
but in this particular case this isn't

978
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,880
an island of security so it really

979
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,490
didn't affect anything in terms of

980
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,350
security here's one where these

981
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:08,120
signatures the keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist but the</font>

982
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,120
signatures for some reason do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist</font>

983
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,990
this is an interesting example things to

984
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,990
show a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to show here this</font>

985
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:19,620
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a key s key signing key</font>

987
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:26,640

administrator an idea of where this this

992
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:38,700
new key tag came from second of an idea

993
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's this is a bad roll over or</font>

994
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,580
something like that which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,050
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

996
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,330
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned the example of a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting this just shows a little bit</font>

1002
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:04,919
of dependency complexities how complex

00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,470
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a grasp but the entire</font>

1007
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture of things I know this is hard to</font>

1008
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:19,470
read from the back but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1009
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,850
shows an alias dependency the the domain

1010
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:22,459
that we were getting failures honor the

1011
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:26,910
name we were getting failures on was ww

1012
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">CMS HHS gov which actually doesn't have</font>

1013
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,990
any DNS SEC problems in fact it isn't

1014
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,730
even anchored the problem was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1015
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:35,040
aliased another name that was anchored

1016
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,900
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> had DNS SEC problems of course that</font>

1017
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,779
name alias is another name and another

1018
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,250
name which didn't have problems but the

1019
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,850
fact that it was somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the alias</font>

1020
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:46,830
chain of it made all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this have have</font>

1021
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:50,430
difficulties<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1022
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:52,620
things that that the tool currently does

1023
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:55,109
it checks consistency which I already

1024
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:59,700
showed an example of that it checks PMT

1025
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:01,290
you on the server side of things it also

1026
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,540
checks<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sec 3 awareness we have a</font>

1027
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of different zones that are</font>

1028
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:13,140
insect 3 signed and one or more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1029
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:15,450
servers are not in sec 3 capable which

1030
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,460
of course affects insecure delegations

1031
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,799
so some of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm planning to do</font>

1032
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,780
for this on the future one first of all

1033
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,970
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not documented very well and will</font>

1034
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:27,270
heat talked about undocumented scripts

1035
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:28,709
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

1036
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,320
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put some more on that fairly</font>

1037
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,600
soon I also intend to do a history so

1038
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,340
that administrators can see what what

1039
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,970
their zone has looked like not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only what</font>

1040
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:41,640
it looks like currently and then do some

1041
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">a regular polling and alert services to</font>

1042
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,270
administrators and then finally some

1043
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,220
kind of restful interface so that

1044
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:49,290
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have potentially query</font>

1045
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,500
the server and ask it questions

1046
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:54,720
periodically

1047
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,270
any questions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we</font>

1048
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,560
have we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1049
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:06,869
questions on maybe one question if

1050
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:08,160
anybody has questions Michael Sinatra UC

1056
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:28,170
useful so thanks a lot for doing it

00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:37,680
with DNS SEC before you put the example

up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrating our problem and</font>

1063
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,770
that wasn't appliance problem and it

1064
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:45,510
actually only was sort of an appliance

1065
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,520
problem the problem did fixed before I

1066
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,770
had my KSK roll over it never should

1067
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,829
have happened except our spam filter

1068
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:54,930
decided starts filtering all of the

1069
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:57,089
notifications of software updates from

1070

the vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the appliance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I didn't</font>

1071
00:45:57,089 --> 00:46:02,009
update my software thank you I've

1072
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,359
actually seen a couple of their zones

1073
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,980
that had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> same problem they must</font>

1074
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,980
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> also had the same spam filters</font>

1075
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:23,650
we have Lucas from UCLA<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so Lucas</font>

1076
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:26,350
Lucas is going to talk about another

1077
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:29,020
visualization tool this is IP this is

1078
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:32,130
for IP address allocation and it's a lot

1079
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">of interesting results as well</font>

presentation so please don't hesitate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1091
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:23,600
go to the microphone and ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1092
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:25,250
questions so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem as we</font>

1093
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:29,960
all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are giving out of the</font>

1094
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:32,990
aquifer addresses and we have given<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

1095
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,970
of them to the organization's or any

1096
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,399
users but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship between</font>

1097
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:40,520
address allocation and the prefix

1098
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:42,140
announcement is still not very clear for

1099
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,950
instance we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the</font>

1100
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:48,049
questions like are the prefixes

1101
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:52,490
announced in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same size as they are</font>

1102
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:54,680
allocated or are all the allocated

1103
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:56,990
prefixes announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure many of you</font>

1104
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,359
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no but I would</font>

1105
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:01,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to use this tool to help you</font>

1106
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:05,000
understand where are these allocated but

1107
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:07,220
unannounced the prefixes and on the

1108
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,190
update site we want to ask are any

1109
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:15,859
unallocated prefixes announce team<font color="#E5E5E5"> v GP</font>

1110
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:18,110
or or if so for for how long time has

1111
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,850
these prefixes being announced this

1112
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:21,800
question sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interesting because</font>

1113
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:24,290
we may wonder why would anybody

1114
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:28,240
announced prefixes that do not belong to

1115
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:32,509
them so the motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this tool</font>

1116
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,729
comes from the huge amount of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

1117
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:37,640
in order to answer these questions

1118
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:40,730
actually different factors of data need

1119
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,220
to be correlated together and the amount

1120
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:46,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data is so huge that it is not quite</font>

1121
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,740
a feasible for a human to jump back and

1122
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:52,760
forth between the large amount of data

1123
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:54,598
and for some network operators if you're

1124
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:59,249
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

1125
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:03,619
small in a specific IP range it would be

1126
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:06,089
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit difficult to extract the</font>

1127
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:08,700
allocations or prefixes within this

1128
00:49:06,089 --> 00:49:13,319
range from from the large allocation

1129
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:16,769
database or a large routing table so so

1130
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:19,400
this tool will help you to get not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

1131
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:23,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the big picture of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happening</font>

1132
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the entire ipv4 address space in</font>

1133
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,598
terms of allocation and the prefix

1134
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,779
announcement but also enables you to

1135
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:34,890
drill down into specific IP IP range

1136
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:36,900
that you're interested in so what IP can

1137
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,569
help you is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide you a</font>

1138
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:42,180
comprehensive picture of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1139
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:44,400
in the entire IP fried rice space in

1140
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:48,509
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of allocation and prefix</font>

1141
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,150
announcement and it also gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> you very</font>

1142
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:53,489
clear a picture regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1143
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:57,089
relationship between allocation and an

announcement like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I just</font>

1145
00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:06,808
decide on you you would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

1146
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:08,940
very easily so allocated but not up but

1147

represent / 8 address blocks under

1207
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:52,308
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the allocation status of</font>

the entire ipv4 address space in the

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rirs gets where get a big chunk of /</font>

1212
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,299
sub allocations<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the ISPs in each</font>

1213
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:15,279
region so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we realized the</font>

1214
00:54:11,299 --> 00:54:18,770
sub allocations as you can see this the

1215
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:22,339
hosting is a / 8 address block and at

1216
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:26,569
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning we have / even I mean at</font>

1217
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:31,430
the at the beginning we have a / 11 stop

1218
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:34,549
allocation so is shown as because this

1219
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:38,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff allocation was issued by Aaron so</font>

1220
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:41,059
I use a red car red color here to show

1221
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:45,289
this allocation block and in the middle

1222
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:48,740
house / 10 stop allocation and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1223
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:51,559
a / / non allocation in the end now

1224
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:55,490
what's interesting here is that was a

1225
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:58,849
tiny portion of address within the / 8th

1226
00:54:55,490 --> 00:55:03,160
block was actually transferred to ripe

1227
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:06,230
is allocated to some organization Europe

1228
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:09,618
so I use post different color and height

1229
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:13,069
to represent the sub allocations managed

1230
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:18,440
by different rirs and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to we</font>

1231
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:21,430
want to realize multiple /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 blocks and</font>

1232
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,950
stop allocations within one figure I

1233
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:29,089
mean this whole picture would be

1234
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:31,700
shrinked into the cell here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1235
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:35,839
bottom and the sub allocation

1236
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:43,549
rectangles would appear like bars so

1237
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:46,220
here is the allocation status including

1238
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:48,829
both allocation in the granularity of /

1239
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:54,230
8 and sub allocations for the entire

1240
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:57,410
ipv4 address space yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think in terms</font>

1241
00:55:54,230 --> 00:56:00,380
of allocation these kind of figures is

1242
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:03,890
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear but as you have might</font>

1243
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:06,650
notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is is kind of</font>

1244
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:09,348
messy and first for some for those of

1245
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:12,880
you who who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> only interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1246
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:16,220
specific IP range you you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1247
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:19,880
drill down into the into the specific

1248
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:22,160
range and so I implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zooming</font>

1249
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,460
in and zooming out feature on this

1250
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture so that you can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clip in in</font>

1251
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:33,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">the in the following slide I will show</font>

1252
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:40,150
you the more detailed allocation within

1253
00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:44,210
24 / 8 and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 / H as well as 193 / 8</font>

1254
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:50,060
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real allocation status</font>

1255
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:52,760
within 24 / 8 as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before these red</font>

1256
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:57,380

this large the second row shows the sub

1260
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:11,480

see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of the sub</font>

00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,270
after the organization got address

1270

address blocks they would announce the

1271

1289

1290
00:58:49,990 --> 00:59:01,990
and it also has 38 children prefixes um

1291
00:58:56,490 --> 00:59:05,620
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I have done with how the</font>

1292
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:08,439
Tool Works I would be more than happy if

1293
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:11,620
you could provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> some feedback and how</font>

1294
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:14,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">would you like to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this tool and in</font>

1295
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:17,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following I mean in the rest of this</font>

1296
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:20,859

1297
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:24,700
results regarding the allocated but not

1298
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:28,510
announced addresses and the reverse the

1299
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:30,850
reversed part so here here this picture

1300
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:38,770
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of allocated but</font>

1301
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:42,370
unannounced address blocks also on on so

1302
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:46,720
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the side as you can see</font>

1303
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:50,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">Swisscom announced a long list of / 8</font>

1304
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:53,680
prefixes that do not belong to them

1305
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:56,070
somewhere somewhere between november 20s

1306
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:59,379
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> december fifth two thousand six and</font>

1307
00:59:56,070 --> 01:00:02,650
and before the announcement

1308
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:06,789
we have we have a lot of small

1309
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:09,279
allocations that do not appear in<font color="#CCCCCC"> VDP</font>

1310
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:13,269
but after the announcement these are

1311
01:00:09,279 --> 01:00:18,900
small small allocations were masked so

1312
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:22,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a big jump in in the curve and</font>

1313
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:25,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Swiss come with rules us these the least</font>

1314
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:28,680
of /a prefixes at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of july two</font>

1315
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,180
thousand nine so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> curve remained</font>

1316
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:39,000
returned back to its previous level

1317
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:41,919
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> around which is around 28,000</font>

1318
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:49,029
entries of allocated but unannounced

1319
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:53,200
address blocks and i also want to

1320
01:00:49,029 --> 01:00:58,539
measure the amount of address that falls

1321
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:05,049
in this category so I let's say in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1322
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:08,529
example we have we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 / 22 address</font>

1323
01:01:05,049 --> 01:01:11,470
blocks and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 / 21 address block</font>

1324
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:14,859
there are not necessarily contiguous to

1325
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:17,319
each other but in terms of measurements

1326
01:01:14,859 --> 01:01:20,380
I just combined them into one / 20 and

1327
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:24,250
give the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result here in this picture as</font>

1328
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:29,049
you can see roughly we have around 25 /

1329
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:33,569
8 amount of addresses that are allocated

1330
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:36,940
but not a nasty<font color="#E5E5E5"> enrolling tables and and</font>

1331
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:42,130
we want we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see where where are</font>

1332
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:46,319
these addresses so i mean this picture

1333
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:50,009
gives you high on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would present</font>

1334
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:55,119
the addresses in this range which is

1335
01:01:50,009 --> 01:01:58,630
allocated by unannounced addresses so

1336
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:03,430
the y-axis here represent the entire

1337
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:06,160
ipv4 address space i would put each i

1338
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:11,769
would put each address block into the

1339
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:13,180
corresponding position of the entire

1340
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:18,089
ipv4 address space

1341
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:21,549
so in this way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see where art is</font>

1342
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:25,690
allocated but unannounced pronounced

1343
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:28,839
addresses so here as you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see we we</font>

1344
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:31,510
have we have both addresses within the

1345
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:35,920
traditional Class A and Class B and

1346
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:40,809
Class C addresses that are allocated by

1347
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:44,470
unannounced and on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reverse part</font>

1348
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:48,430
we also want to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced the</font>

1349
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:51,459
prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not allocated so this</font>

1350
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:55,960
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you the number of of agri</font>

1351
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:59,609
of prefixes in in this category so that

1352
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">y y axis is just the number of prefixes</font>

1353
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:07,270
as you can see the number of prefixes in

1354
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:10,200
this range is order is orders of

1355
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:15,790
magnitude less than the previous case

1356
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:23,020
which is for remote for most of the time

1357
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:25,470
it is below 2500 and the trend<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows the</font>

1358
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:30,069
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prefixes in this range</font>

1359
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:32,759
decreases as time goes by and this

1360
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture gives you the amount of prefect</font>

1361
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:40,930
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of addresses in this in this</font>

1362
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:43,029
category and we can also see that the

1363
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:47,078
amount of addresses in this really

1364
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:58,000
decreases recently from from the end of

1365
01:03:47,079 --> 01:04:00,880
2009 and so who announced these prefixes

1366
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:06,040
that do not belong to them on this this

1367
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:10,020
picture shows shows the Oregon<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s</font>

1368
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:15,490
distribution in time axis so in the

1369
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:17,950
y-axis is the asid is not at its not

1370
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:20,049
actually one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> S's announced the</font>

1371
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:22,930
prefixes that do not belong to them is

1372
01:04:20,049 --> 01:04:25,509
actually a bunch of bunch of guesses as

1373
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:28,029
you can see here on

1374
01:04:25,509 --> 01:04:37,599
some somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has continuously doing</font>

1375
01:04:28,029 --> 01:04:40,329
this and and some es here most work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1376
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:43,179
some some has just announced prefixes

1377
01:04:40,329 --> 01:04:50,469
for a very short period of time and

1378
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:53,829
stops doing that so we captured several

1379
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:59,549
Nam anomaly cases and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1380
01:04:53,829 --> 01:05:04,589
July 12 2005 to August the second 2005a

1381
01:04:59,549 --> 01:05:09,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">s29 vo5 just announced more than 50 / 8</font>

1382
01:05:04,589 --> 01:05:12,599
prefixes and the BGP the BP monitor with

1383
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:15,848
this IP address captured this event and

1384
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:17,859
the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> row in the second row that</font>

1385
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:23,139
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing happen</font>

1386
01:05:17,859 --> 01:05:26,679
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> is 16 to 15 announced more</font>

1387
01:05:23,139 --> 01:05:30,159
than 60 / 8 prefixes that do not belong

1388
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:34,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">to it and actually two monitors captured</font>

1389
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:39,459
this event and we have even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more kisses</font>

1390
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:44,109
so to wrap things up IP is a tool that

1391
01:05:39,459 --> 01:05:49,479
helps you not only manage the allocation

1392
01:05:44,109 --> 01:05:51,880
of addresses but i think is is pretty

1393
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:54,669
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to visualize the</font>

1394
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:57,909
prefix tree structure in routing tables

1395
01:05:54,669 --> 01:06:00,129
and the it helps us to understand the

1396
01:05:57,909 --> 01:06:03,519
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> between address allocation</font>

1397
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:08,679
and their usage in routing tables and in

1398
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:12,158
terms of measurement without on our

1399
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:15,519
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows that around 25 / 8 amount</font>

1400
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:18,489
of allocated addresses are not are not

1401
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:23,399
visible in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default prism and around</font>

1402
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:26,769
1 to 1.5 / 8 amount of unallocated

1403
01:06:23,399 --> 01:06:30,939
prefixes are observed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp monitors</font>

1404
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:35,859
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stellar monitors even even captured</font>

1405
01:06:30,939 --> 01:06:37,899
a long list of / 8 prefixes that's it

1406
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:42,130
any questions you have time for one

1407
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:45,910
quick question and people can grab Lucas

1408
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:48,789
after the session what's the

1409
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:51,249
significance of Hector's box not being

1410
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:56,920
available in the DFC like why does that

1411
01:06:51,249 --> 01:07:01,720
matter um you mean the alligator but<font color="#CCCCCC"> nah</font>

1412
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:07,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">noun not an ass yes um this is just some</font>

1413
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:10,569
merriman see I know some I mean the

1414
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:14,230
address were after at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address were</font>

1415
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:18,160
giving out to the organization's they I

1416
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:19,839
mean they have different readers not

1417
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,960
announcing them they may they may be

1418
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:25,680
using them inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> their only as so</font>

1419
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,910
that's not observed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the default</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prism</font>

1420
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:31,749
so it's just a measurement thing for you

1421
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:37,319
is not about right no conjectures to why

1422
01:07:31,749 --> 01:07:48,749
that maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> face</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1423
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:48,749
thanks Lucas next we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> son</font>

1427
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:22,010
in a log and I'm placed to give a talk

1428
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:24,859
evaluating potential resulting diversity

for internet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philly recovery this is</font>

1430
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:30,230
a co work with the chitin and the engine

resources here we just to give some

1585
01:18:04,449 --> 01:18:12,049
given one possible ways first I'd like

the emergency or the disaster for this

1603
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:21,660
purpose we neither one was communication

1604
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:24,760
channel and one communication protocol

1605
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:27,940
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers they are already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

Rec director connection with different

1607
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:33,730
appears so they are the communication

1608
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:38,430
channel there for co-located is is in a

1609
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:42,450
semi XP we can broadcast the message wyd

1610
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:46,960
switches and this the message can be

1611
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:52,990
encrypted if there is some privacy

1612
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:57,580
conciliar so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a figure to show</font>

1613
01:19:52,990 --> 01:20:01,870
the communication process firstly the

01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:06,519
victim is will send a query to its peers

01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:09,010
or its co-located aspx pas which name

the potential helper on the right hand

01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:15,070
of this picture and asked who can

its connectivity to that specific AAS

1622
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">give some tools like a free self and the</font>

1624
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:36,550
bandwidth he can provide it can provide

1625
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:41,680
through some at active measurement tools

1626
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:45,130
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> jaws pistol and so on if anyone</font>

message were sent back to the victim<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS</font>

1629
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:58,590
and tell the victim guess how much he

1630
01:20:51,700 --> 01:21:04,120
can provide then the victim s will

1631
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:08,770
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> the helper from his own angle and</font>

1632
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:13,960
send back a CT ack message

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> alas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp session can be set up</font>

1634
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:23,320
and that you're after the emergency the

1635
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp session also can be withdrawal so</font>

1636
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:31,929
there is another problem is the the

1637
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:35,890
victim s will choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or some help</font>

to recover all the traffic at at least

1642
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:54,820

1643
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:57,040
we are doing now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is also a working</font>

1646
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:08,620
is a nice piece and quickly summarize

what what we we are doing now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

customer preferred hypothesis secondly

1668
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:28,060
on the belief that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use route</font>

views and risk data to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

reasonable a escapology graph of the

follows the control plane all three of

1673
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:43,180
those hypotheses are highly questionable

1674
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:46,950
and there's significant recent papers

1675
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:49,660
showing that you should not trust them
