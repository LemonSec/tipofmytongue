again we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about what net</font>

42
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,589
obvious now what we intend for it to

43
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:09,619
become and then had to get there from

44
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,150
here so right now Nana provides forms in

45
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,080
the North American region for education

46
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,230
and sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of knowledge for the</font>

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,819
internet operations community

48
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:21,500
conferences mailing lists nothing new

49
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:22,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">there now gives an activity of Merit</font>

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,959
network

51
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,840
that is the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,310
intending to change and doing this being

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,110
an activity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merit has a bunch of</font>

54
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,920
implications in terms of the way we

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,920
operate and our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to self-govern</font>

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,140
ultimately merit it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> attitude of</font>

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,869
merit merit signs the contract merit has

58
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,899
the money merit has the risk americus to

59
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,880
tell us how things are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run if</font>

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,050
you want to spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million dollars</font>

61
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,130
buying a corporate jet they'll tell us

62
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:57,959
now that's sort of thing of course so

63
00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:00,480
yeah we don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that governance we have</font>

64
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,980
these committees program communications

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,730
the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here get the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the manliest running so these are</font>

70
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,929
self-governance for institutions that

71
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,489
were generated in 2005 the big thing

72
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,040
though is that since its merits money

73
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">merit tells us ultimately has the</font>

74
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,280
authority to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moment not</font>

75
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,920

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,810
doing this we have a working governance

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,250
model but limited ability to act i think

78
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,739
we've shown over the last five years

79
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">since the transition with a couple</font>

for the good of the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for</font>

the good of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conference's and all</font>

84
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:55,650
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will lead us in the directions</font>

85
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,570
we want to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that step further by</font>

86
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,190
becoming an independent legal entity

87
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,680
with our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources of funding on</font>

88
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,829
financial management of control and most

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,220
importantly a membership which is you

90
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:11,640
guys and the corporation is owned by the

91
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,970
members and members by electing the

92
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:20,310
board and choosing bylaws and that sort

perhaps at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom one that it's</font>

100
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,919
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note is right now all the</font>

101
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,050
backroom stuff the<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this making</font>

lights are on is done by merit we

105
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,400
believe that through some combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

106
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,210
contracted services and very limited

107
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,159
paid staff of our own we can accomplish

108
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:08,530
the same things without disrupting

109
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:09,729
things so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not intending to hire a</font>

110
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,049
whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to duplicate</font>

exactly what mirror does that way that

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:20,949
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pointless so let's see the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mission stays the same we're still doing</font>

outreach beyond the conference's outside

121
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:46,000
kind of thing governance we have already

122
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,240
created a board of directors<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font>

130
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:09,159
structured right now it was easy easiest

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,550
to have the six people become the six

132
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,840
board members might want people idea

possibilities let's see membership is

136
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,990
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> too because we want the people</font>

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,819
even some meetings and

145
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:44,580
want to participate no reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

146
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,500
shouldn't be allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to funding will</font>

147
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,740
spend our funding sources right now most

148
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,689
of the revenue is from meetings either

149
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,580
your registration fees or the dollars

150
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:56,039
paid to sponsor the breaks outside that

151
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,289
sort of thing we believe we can increase

152
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,979
our sources of funding make it more

153
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:03,990
broad diverse and less dependent on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

154
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,568
attendance at any individual specific

meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in doing so that means we</font>

156
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,520
can keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting costs at a</font>

157
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:15,180
reasonable level and not up at the cisco

networkers level or interoperate that

159
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,479
kind of thing this order order of

160
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,699
magnitude difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> their membership</font>

161
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,900
we've been talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a bit we</font>

162
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely won't have a paid membership</font>

163
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:31,620
who are empowered to<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote in the</font>

164
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,080
elections there been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

165
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,360
the membership will mean what benefits

166
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,750
that will be aside from being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

167
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,210
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a non-member um it won't be</font>

168
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,129
terribly expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have to provide</font>

169
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,580
ways for people on limited budgets like

170
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:50,879
students to be able to join in and

171
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:54,409
participate maybe meeting discounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

172
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">as the right sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of thing Oh</font>

173
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:03,150
conferences and mailing lists so as I

174
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:06,360
said before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to increase the</font>

175
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">sponsorship to help keep the attendee</font>

176
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,389
costs down will contract out some of the

177
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:15,360
logistics that are being handled bat now

178
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:19,229
by merit so that we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

179
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,120
ourselves or hire people to do it but we

180
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:23,878
will keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the management aspects of it</font>

181
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,500
in the corporation and participation

182
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,810
through various committees and things

183
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:33,390
that you all are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be us to join</font>

184
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:36,750
in and help out on and let's see

185
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,500
timeline and budget so this is a the end

186
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,940
of the very brief recap from yesterday

187
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,599
so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll ask if anybody has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

188
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,160
questions or

189
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,740
anything we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of that they</font>

190
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,990
want to talk about and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see</font>

191
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:55,360
anybody watching two microphones Randy's

192
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:58,269
in the different room and uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

193
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,029
then Sylvia you want to know there's

194
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:03,610
somebody to microphone so I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

195
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:07,089
last night but I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> destroy you Oh only</font>

196
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:10,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jacob San Francisco excuse me I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

197
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:14,319
wonder why you decided on the membership

198
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:17,620
model rather than say for example what

199
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:20,469
the ITF has where there is no membership

200
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,500
and there is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> umbrella organization of</font>

201
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,050
course which is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could say well foot</font>

202
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,910
well funded but did you actually need

203
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,300
the funding of the membership model to

204
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,399
keep going on a continuous basis is that

205
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,740
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the reason for them that wasn't</font>

206
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,019
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason the member dollars certainly</font>

207
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,690
don't hurt but it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's not</font>

208
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,819
necessary for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survival the main</font>

209
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,560
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think for doing it is that it</font>

210
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:46,479
empowers the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who choose to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

211
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">members to participate in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the governance</font>

212
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,370
of nanog in a way that being part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

213
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,500
bigger organization camp that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

214
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,060
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say it it means that you by</font>

215
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,149
becoming a member get to vote on who

216
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,489
your officers are board is what the

217
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:06,910
bylaws look like and help shape the

218
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,220
direction of of the organization and

219
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,639
right it does it does bring a little

220
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">more dollars in than just the hand to</font>

221
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,040
mouth everything currently is structured

222
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,649
the funding for the activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

223
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,099
nana is all based on what goes on here

224
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,509
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conference and that that limits</font>

225
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,889
if you recall all the discussions we've

226
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:28,630
had in the past that community meetings

227
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,269
about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we have different</font>

228
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:34,839
numbers of meetings a year the budget

229
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,250
does not work if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font>

230
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,449
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tune some of those variables without</font>

231
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,860
having any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other cushion or input vector</font>

232
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,240
also say one other thing which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

233
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,040
there are some stuff flooding on the

234
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,269
mailing list about you need to be a

235
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,949
member to participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,660
minimalistic on the conferences and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

237
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:51,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe anybody has any intention</font>

238
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,350
of actually doing that

239
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,660
so I see then I think in the back there

240
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just some thoughts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the membership</font>

241
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,410
front this isn't really a new idea i

242
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,320
think someone dug up a male thread with

243
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">tom scholz suggesting this in 2004 so</font>

244
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,310
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has been around for a</font>

245
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:12,620
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's I think two really</font>

246
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,469
good reasons to do this how one good

247
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,740
reason is because it introduces some

248
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,290
selection bias into nanog in other words

249
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,390
for the governance part some people care

250
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,760
a lot about this and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

251
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,040
care at all and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is right now</font>

252
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,920
we have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care</font>

253
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">at all participating exactly once ever</font>

254
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,510
every long long period which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is by</font>

255
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,740
voting for people they don't know and

256
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,540
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about because people</font>

257
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,880
are from the podium begging them to do

258
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,800
it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this adds a little bit</font>

259
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,260
of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know people actually have</font>

260
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,939
to care at least a minimal amount and

261
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,189
they care about a volunteering getting

262
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,320
involved and and being paid members the

263
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,770
other issue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has come up repeatedly</font>

264
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,450
over time is that network engineering a

265
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,939
network architecture seems to be the one

266
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,130
professional discipline that lacks any

267
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,980
kind of professional membership

268
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,140
organization you know ago all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

269
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,860
sorts of disciplines like this you know

270
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,290
have VI tripoli in the ACM and you've

271
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,900
got the asme and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font>

272
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,880
organizations and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks would</font>

273
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,800
like to be able for a small fee to

274
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,480
actually put truthfully on the resume

275
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,130
that they're a member<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a professional</font>

276
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization that's devoted to their</font>

277
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:29,780
profession and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

278
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:33,920
value in that oh I wonder if you guys

279
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:37,370
could sorry Phil Woodcock from the back

280
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,439
row back there under if you guys could

281
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,810
spend a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time talking about</font>

282
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">your thoughts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the related issues</font>

283
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:49,310
of institutionalization scope creep and

284
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:54,790
budget that is once this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort</font>

285
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,790
of up and running and has staff and

286
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,750
a reason to continue making itself

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:05,730
bigger and looking for ever more money

288
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:08,190
and so forth do you allow it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal vow</font>

289
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,190
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the executive director to</font>

290
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,830
set the budget or do you figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what</font>

291
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,200
achievable fundraising<font color="#E5E5E5"> targets are and</font>

292
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,390
then tell the executive director that

293
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:26,100
that is their budget with what direction

294
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:28,470
would you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that going honestly we've</font>

295
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,320
been focusing on just making it work the

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,360
short<font color="#CCCCCC"> term a lot of the scope creep</font>

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,560

<font color="#CCCCCC">this slide some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its been Holly</font>

299
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,050
conversations I think we need the

300
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,640
membership to tell us what the purpose

301
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,329
of the organization is within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the limits</font>

302
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,670
of course of what's in in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission</font>

303
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:51,510
statement and what's allowable to remain

304
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,770
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 501c3 taxes and organization there are</font>

305
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,960
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things you're not allowed to do</font>

306
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,100
if you do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with sure a lot of you</font>

307
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">know already so within those parameters</font>

308
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:04,950
that there's certainly room to innovate

309
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:06,540
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the board needs to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

310
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,520
careful when entertaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of these</font>

311
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,099
notions to understand how they're going

312
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,720
to affect budgets and and the ability to

313
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,550
care what we're already supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

314
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,780
doing there's definitely a lot of us see

315
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,459
something shiny and say hey let's go

316
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,260
work on that and then we can't allow

317
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,050
that to distract us<font color="#E5E5E5"> from keeping things</font>

318
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,030
working that's the way I see I know if

319
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,939
anyone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to what's the throne</font>

325
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,300
the point that you made is is the meta

326
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,090
point which is that we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

327
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,810
on this for about three three-and-a-half

328
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,610
months now and we're actually pretty far

along compared to most startups<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

things that still need to be done and

there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> many seats at the table and</font>

of stuff and governance of nonprofits is

337
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,470
certainly one of those and there are a

actually makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to somebody like me</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe also was on the review</font>

363
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:43,310
yesterday just kind of showing where we

364
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,680
are now what's uh folks had asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

365
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,160
know what's the you know when is the

366
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,779
ratification what's going on in terms of

367
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,250
getting the buy-in from the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

368
00:16:50,779 --> 00:17:00,880
addition to just the session here and

369
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:03,860
pretty much is delineated with with the

370
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:08,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">the election the normal election cycle</font>

371
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:10,339
that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be having in October and one</font>

372
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,809
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

logistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't haven't been sorted</font>

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">but one thing that merit has come Ford</font>

375
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,199
and said that they'll help us with is

376
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,900
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the parallel</font>

377
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,209
elections and actually make sure that

378
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:29,150
everyone who's currently enfranchised in

379
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:32,030
the existing nanog voting world can help

380
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:36,440
ratify what we're going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

381
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:41,149
doing here what else to say about this

382
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:44,210
we have a sharp delineation between when

383
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,000
the the merit activity is again as we

384
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,640
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday and Steve talked</font>

385
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,250
about just<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's all based on the</font>

386
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:57,350
budget cycles<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the DA we have we have</font>

387
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:01,280
a contracted hotel with alcatel-lucent

388
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:06,770
as the host for 52 and 53 working with

<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron thank you again JC for the for the</font>

390
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:14,960
pro forma budget work we ran the we ran

391
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:17,210
the numbers as two sets just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a what we</font>

392
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,380
think are some realistic numbers based

393
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,930
on past performance

394
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,910
and what we think are pessimistic

395
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,000
numbers if we completely trip all over

396
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:33,240
ourselves and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also winds up</font>

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:37,350
happily being the break-even case these

398
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">are these I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was Bill Norton</font>

I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what his current</font>

400
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:45,650
affiliation is and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking how</font>

401
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,390
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings per year this is a</font>

402
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">three-year pro forma so that's you know</font>

403
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,970
year one is now so there are meetings

404
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:57,600
that are operated by merit during your

405
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:59,520
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> year to next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year meetings operated</font>

406
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,800
by merit and by nu nog and year three

407
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,560
meetings upgraded by new node and the

408
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,000
current projection are are sticking with

409
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,379
the three meetings until we get the idea

410
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,810
of what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a tot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Underwood</font>

411
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,360
google so one of the related questions

412
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,580
is there have been a large number of

413
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,740
loudmouths who want fewer meetings per

414
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,389
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and never a great consensus on</font>

415
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,970
whether that was what we all wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

416
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,770
do or not and those conversations were

417
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,180
sort of squashed by merit basically

418
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,310
saying we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these overheads these</font>

419
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,330
people exist they need to be paid you

420
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,250
know this isn't going to work

421
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,320
financially for us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> please don't do</font>

422
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,910
that and so we didn't really seriously

423
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,770
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's clearly not something</font>

424
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,600
that is essential that we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about now</font>

425
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">but one of the things I'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see is</font>

426
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,370
is it true that with a mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> outsource</font>

427
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,889
model costs scale very differently on a

428
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,840
per meeting basis now rather than having

429
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,460
a sort of partial staffing model where

430
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,570
they don't scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> as night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list nicely</font>

431
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,940
that way because if the answer is yes

432
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,800
then then this becomes a now we don't

433
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,960
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right now but it</font>

434
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't be much more expensive to do two</font>

435
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:05,540
versus three well it to to you know to

436
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,250
address that it requires additional

437
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:12,300
sponsorship model elements that we do

438
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,190
not currently have no matter how you no

439
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,690
matter how you slice it because again

440
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,520
it's the it's the current the current

441
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,910
funding is essentially a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand-to-mouth</font>

442
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,610
operation where it is every meeting pays

443
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:27,590
for the meetings that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know every</font>

444
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,590
meeting pays for the set of meetings

445
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,950
so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking about some of the</font>

446
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,950
specifics there this is within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

447
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,590
realistic assumptions and you know

448
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,060
they're not now they're not overly

449
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,800
optimistic they're just based on past

450
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,990
performance and and the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status</font>

of work that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> marketed working group</font>

453
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:55,120
assumptions about some of the meeting

454
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,160
sponsorships again you know walking

455
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,989
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking 60 odd people through</font>

00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">spreadsheets kind of interesting on that</font>

457
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">on large projector the there have been</font>

questions about the memberships<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,850
pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a number of people who are in</font>

465
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,800
the interested participants without

466
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:33,459
actually having to make it coupled with

467
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">any particular other activity if Randy's</font>

468
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:40,180
activity earlier was any sign then

469
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,610
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy-peasy there's a nominal</font>

470
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,520
growth rate as we go based on the

471
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,590
attendance and the the fact that we have

472
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a third newcomers every time and</font>

473
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,730
presuming that there is a percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

474
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,820
the newcomers that will tag along and

475
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,080
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually join the organization</font>

476
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,169
there's a category they're called early

477
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,449
contributors we were indicating that for

478
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,120
folks who are like like spectrum who

479
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,310
helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> us out with getting underwriting</font>

480
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,790
that some of the contract issues we've

481
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:14,530
already dealt with that we would solicit

482
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:18,010
a modest number of corporate

483
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,780
contributors to you know obviously when

484
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,480
there's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're when we blow at</font>

485
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:26,020
these numbers the bottom line looks a

486
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,600
lot better and that the individual

487
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,100
contributors you know we were not in

488
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,419
decoupling that from the actual

489
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,370
memberships because this is something

490
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a getting a thanks and</font>

time Kim Netflix and marketing working

496
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,510
group member so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at early</font>

497
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,830
early contributors in a corporate of

498
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">5000 that makes sense but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same</font>

499
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,809
time if we look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current nanog</font>

500
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,660
model or you know based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit</font>

501
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:03,360
model of sponsorships people kind of

502
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,120
expect something for that at a meeting

503
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,600
right we have the vendors who set up out

504
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,850
here for breaks your gear you know

505
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever that may be and while people</font>

506
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,090
are relatively generous and actually you

507
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,940
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think that we probably could</font>

508
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,580
find five companies in this room that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

509
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,450
could get five thousand dollars out of

510
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,559
without it being too big of an issue

511
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:28,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">that coupled with the next set of line</font>

512
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,240
items which is sponsors you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

513
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:31,710
let you speak to that but that concerns

514
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,600
me a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that seems like</font>

515
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,980
a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> far departure from where we are</font>

516
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:41,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">today I can't think of anyone who we</font>

517
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,400
could pump for fifty thousand dollars it

518
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,549
just doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean saying realistic</font>

519
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,650
assumptions that to me is an incredibly

520
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:54,600
optimistic assumption not a realistic

521
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:57,360
assumption so I the one comment I would

522
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,439
leave that with is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I don't</font>

523
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if Dan's going to rebut something</font>

524
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,760
here but go ahead is that the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

525
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,909
that actually tends to work pretty well

526
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,970
today I would say actually is how we

527
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,799
handle sponsorships vendors like the

528
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,360
fact that for four or five thousand

529
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,879
dollars they can get their name out

530
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,830
there in the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard I</font>

531
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel that if we if someone's</font>

532
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:22,409
contributing $50,000 they're going to

533
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,790
feel almost a sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ownership over</font>

534
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,510
this organization and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

535
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:32,250
turn into alka Lou nog not in not be

536
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,990
that odd or new doc what rumor maybe it

537
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,970
just is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> citizen I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have to tune</font>

538
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:39,360
this up a little bit so that the numbers

539
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">I work out dave is probably right that</font>

540
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,919
the numbers do high but you have other

541
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:44,380
numbers

542
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,140
too low that will actually come up to to

543
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,750
adjust it so while the gold silver

544
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,530
bronze maybe the dollar signs are too

545
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,720
high the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sponsorships</font>

546
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:58,120
particularly at a bronze level of say 10

547
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,170
or 15 will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> much much more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

548
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,540
first so so if bronze was say five

549
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,530
thousand dollars I would make that one

550
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:10,240
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten right so that</font>

551
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,490
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get more cash in the end</font>

552
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,770
it's more more to manage right so it is

553
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:17,440
challenging<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more sponsors you have</font>

554
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,780
to manage those relationships but you

555
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,510
know if silver is then 10,000 and gold

556
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:25,149
is 20,000 you're gonna have maybe one in

557
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:28,300
one there but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still far more cash</font>

558
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,620
than if you price it at 50 40 20 dizzle

559
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,149
is all good feedback I didn't want to

560
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that the like the gold thing that</font>

561
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,650
was ticked off that was based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

562
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,710
fact that we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> get us that you</font>

563
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,100
know that's the most that we've we pull

564
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:46,300
out and we currently the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana</font>

565
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:51,659
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marit Marit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets that from</font>

566
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:53,740
errands for the for the operation of

567
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,140
certain video casting and archiving

568
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,720
tonight but essentially that that type

569
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:01,270
of money right is my op unit is not

570
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,400
garbage and again this is this is a this

571
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,900
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an annual right that's an annual</font>

572
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,600
autumn it's not expected to be a repeat

573
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:13,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright well the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other way to sort of</font>

574
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:15,580
recast this is to you know have instead

575
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,169
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having sort of annual gold silver</font>

576
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,919
bronze sponsors and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> having meeting</font>

577
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:22,720
sponsors is to consider taking totally

578
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,340
breaking the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> MTG sponsorship</font>

579
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,670
model with things like beer in gear and

580
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:31,300
break<font color="#E5E5E5"> and badge and and breaking that</font>

581
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:34,300
and making gold silver bronze that say

582
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:37,090
you know gold might be something like

583
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,889
35k a meeting silver might be something

584
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,750
like 20 km eating bronze might be said

585
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,520
like 10k a meeting but then roll in

586
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,870
stuff like you get a beer your

587
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,760
sponsorship for this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not for</font>

588
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,139
this one you get a you know this one

589
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,390
goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lander this one cause of the</font>

590
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,119
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> grades</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regulate these are all great</font>

591
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,759
ideas

592
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,589
you're still basically actually you just

593
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">volunteered for the budgeting working</font>

594
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:57,829
group both of you think you're all i

595
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:59,239
wanted to say all I wanted to say we

596
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:01,668
always have these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just these are</font>

597
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:03,499
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines on a spreadsheet that you're</font>

598
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:05,629
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was going to let CQ address</font>

599
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:07,039
the fact that what they represent are

600
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:09,319
actually pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan was just</font>

601
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,539
describing right but the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

602
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:14,059
is that you know based on whether you're

603
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:18,439
this way or the other way I think there

604
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:21,918
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of money so Chris can I</font>

605
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:25,729
just ask one quick question for do we

606
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,879
feel that the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> model you know I</font>

607
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:31,819
recognize we're reforming<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a you</font>

608
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:33,559
know new entity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we feel that the</font>

609
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:36,529
current sponsorship model is necessarily

610
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,559
broken do we feel is the business

611
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:42,559
sustaining based on the current model<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

612
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,699
this something we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

613
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,489
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

614
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:48,169
going forward once the rest of the

615
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:54,409
organization was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorted out well</font>

616
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:56,029
there are something well you um I if I

617
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:59,689
basically answer that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> black and</font>

618
00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:02,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">white question I will say yes I think</font>

619
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:06,249
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need for change and a</font>

620
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:08,899
breakdown of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these sponsorships is</font>

621
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:12,379
comparable to what we're actually kind

622
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:17,508
of collecting today from say a single

623
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:19,998
<font color="#CCCCCC">entity who purchases three Bering gears</font>

624
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:22,999
to the year what we're basically trying

625
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:25,639
to do is couple some of the items that

626
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:32,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">they are already paid for and give them</font>

627
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:35,418
I per se a status symbol with

628
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:37,099
participating for three knocks as

629
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:40,519
opposed to someone who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

630
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:44,809
participate for a single nanog and maybe

631
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:47,269
does a social and a breakout and a beer

632
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:49,459
in gear and someone who actually wants

633
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:52,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">to participate for tuna dogs so we're</font>

634
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:55,419
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking some of this the exact or</font>

635
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:57,168
the existing programs that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

636
00:28:55,419 --> 00:29:00,330
trying to make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

637
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:04,010
efficient as far as

638
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:06,240
um sponsor revenue for an animal right

639
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,340
I'll stop hogging the mic let me just

640
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">make one comment to that and then I will</font>

641
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,408
play if they sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down I would be weary</font>

642
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,360
of making<font color="#E5E5E5"> two too many changes around</font>

643
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:17,279
that model if we feel that we're getting

644
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,469
enough cash now to sustain the

645
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,360
organization perhaps we would be much

646
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,539
better off keeping the current model

647
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">until that new organization is fully</font>

648
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:28,950
established and sustaining itself and

649
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,169
then we can phase in changes like this I

650
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:34,350
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid of sponsors being</font>

651
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,539
gun-shy and saying well if I'm gonna

652
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,590
dump in twenty thousand dollars and I

653
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:40,230
have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not this is</font>

654
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,529
going to work then you know I may not

655
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:46,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of commitment i</font>

656
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm sorry Gary again the dumping in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

657
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:51,330
twenty thousand dollars doesn't mean

658
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,610
that just basically get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know a</font>

659
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:56,220
bumper sticker that says hey I supported

660
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,590
nanog they're actually trying to

661
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">participate in some of our already</font>

662
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:03,240
existing program I understand but again

663
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:05,220
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of vendors may not they see this</font>

664
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,419
as a sponsorship opportunity and they

665
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't necessarily want to be part of the</font>

666
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,159
community so but you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

667
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:13,889
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and respect that you</font>

668
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a company like Citrix for example</font>

669
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:18,149
is a huge company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is willing to</font>

670
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,070
spend five thousand dollars to do some

671
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,658
marketing but doesn't want anything to

672
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,908
do with the actual inner workings of

673
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,919
nanog and may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

674
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:28,019
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

675
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,460
supporting a fledgling organization they

676
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,779
don't they don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that they</font>

677
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,399
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> care that they get their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name out</font>

678
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,500
and they spend five thousand dollars on

679
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,449
sponsoring something and they have a

680
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,100
very strict deliverable that they get

681
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,019
and I'm using them as an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

682
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,090
this could apply to many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

683
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:44,250
again alcatel-lucent it's a great

684
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,299
example this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big model if</font>

685
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:50,789
accompanied that doesn't care about

686
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:52,350
directly impacting this they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

687
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,940
their name out there but they're not

688
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the doctor appoint someone</font>

689
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,480
to a board or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to</font>

690
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,399
directly contributes you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

691
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,060
those are valid points and actually I

692
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,060
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

693
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,980
you know we do need the sponsorships to

694
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,260
be participants as opposed to just

695
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,550
handing us money and going on their way

696
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,340
there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said for just</font>

697
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,230
handing us money though<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's go tell</font>

698
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:19,520
thanks and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't Vidiot before you sit</font>

699
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:22,140
down um we are by and large in this room

700
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,710
engineers and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> falling into a trap</font>

701
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:29,750
here and I have lost count of how many

702
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">times I've gotten my busts chopped by</font>

703
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:37,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">cxos for concentrating on how rather</font>

704
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,380
than what we're doing a deep dive here

705
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:43,020
and there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be ample opportunity for</font>

706
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,700
that the I draw your<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to the</font>

707
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,930
word in the upper left hand corner of

708
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,390
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide which is if we are totally on</font>

709
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,880
crack and it's the wrong order of

710
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:56,370
magnitude then yeah we should probably

711
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,810
visit that and visit it quickly but if

712
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,600
it's a matter of squishing numbers

713
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:02,129
around until it works I guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

714
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,530
it's going to happen it's going to

715
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:11,070
happen a lot so I'm just all of your

716
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:13,320
points are well taken and i agree with

717
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:17,520
with some of them that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move</font>

718
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff around but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want us to get</font>

719
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,970
down to where we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the</font>

720
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:24,179
forest<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not advocating moving stuff</font>

721
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:26,970
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it may not be</font>

722
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,610
worth changing the existing model as

723
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,530
part of this transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> i understand</font>

724
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that my dear i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,950
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to kind of prove the larger</font>

727
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:42,630
point that maybe it's not we're changing

728
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:45,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> monica</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Jay yeah Jay</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hannigan impulse advanced communications</font>

730
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,490
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was brought up yesterday</font>

731
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,580
was there was a roughly three hundred

732
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:56,130
thousand dollar budget for one of the

733
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,780
meetings that was shown<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came within</font>

734
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:03,270
I think a thousand dollars or so of

735
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:04,440
balancing exactly I also sympathized

736
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,780
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that we are mostly</font>

737
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,550
engineers and not bankers and the

738
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:12,360
comment was made that banking should be

739
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:14,020
boring therefore what I would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

740
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,090
see on this slide

741
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:20,020
this is this is a proposal apparently

742
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,760
for a relatively large change in the way

743
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,730
that we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things here what would</font>

744
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,150
be useful to me would be to see what the

745
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:30,310
revenue is under the present model and

746
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is what what the differences are I</font>

747
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:35,080
see you know gold sponsors of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty</font>

748
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand dollars i have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what</font>

749
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,179
comcast for example contributed for this

750
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,280
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whether that's way above</font>

751
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,640
whether that's way below in other words

752
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,810
what from from a strict participant

753
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,800
things seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been working</font>

754
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:54,700
reasonably well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with the</font>

755
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:57,820
presentation of nanog as it as it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is i</font>

756
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,710
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that self governance it sounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

757
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:03,300
me like everyone's on board that that's

758
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:06,910
a good thing to do I was not as as

759
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:09,070
convinced of that earlier but as far as

760
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,720
making radical changes in terms of

761
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:14,860
budgeting and things that should be

762
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:18,540
boring why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it would be</font>

763
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,679
interesting to for me to see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

764
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,009
what's being changed from the way things

765
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:26,168
are being done now I can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that one</font>

766
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:31,450
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that changes in a self-governing</font>

767
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:34,089
model is we need to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

768
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:38,439
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cash to operate on a going</font>

769
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:40,990
basis previously under the merit

770
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,110
governance that pilot cash was not

771
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:47,229
necessary because merit dug into its own

772
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:50,230
pocket to advance money for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana</font>

773
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:53,429
activity going forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we're</font>

774
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:57,700
independent we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep pockets</font>

775
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:59,950
that will advance<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty thousand</font>

776
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,549
dollars to pay down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hotel contract in</font>

777
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:06,580
a year's time arranging and contracting

778
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:09,640
for these conferences so that is what

779
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:14,020
the sponsorship models allow is to have

780
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:16,270
a base of cash flow from the beginning

781
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that becomes your operating cash</font>

782
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:21,060
flow as you are progressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> throughout</font>

783
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:25,480
the year if I may that's the difference

784
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:27,558
however the the need for that is

785
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometime in the future because merit</font>

786
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:32,539
has already agreed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go forward for the</font>

787
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:37,489
next couple of meetings correct we have

788
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:40,249
paid down hotel for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Denver it's it's not</font>

789
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:42,769
so it's in a year's time and yeah the

790
00:35:40,249 --> 00:35:45,919
runway is not that long yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards</font>

791
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:50,058
have to be put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay again um</font>

792
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,359
just to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reiterate all all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valid</font>

793
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:55,130
points um that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just heard but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

794
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,799
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is over a year there's</font>

795
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:01,880
three nan augs not just a breakdown of a

796
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:03,469
single man hog so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you kind of as</font>

797
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,999
you look at these<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers in the columns</font>

798
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:09,410
each one is is three and and even though

799
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,968
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> says realistic assumptions there's</font>

800
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,410
still some pessimistic elements in here

801
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,819
like you'll see the vendor collaboration

802
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,930
room carries forward with zero when

803
00:36:13,819 --> 00:36:17,660
we've actually been getting good

804
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:20,180
traction with that yeah just as a minor

805
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,279
example but Todd and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really hope</font>

806
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:26,118
I could move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on from revenue to expenses</font>

807
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:28,939
won't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fun let's see two quick</font>

808
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,349
points one is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon he made the</font>

809
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:32,209
most important point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is clear</font>

810
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:34,069
that what this is about this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

811
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:36,558
skewed in order to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with more</font>

812
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:40,219
cash quickly and so priority<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

813
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:42,739
given to ideas that generate cash one of

814
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:45,489
the ones that I have heard is a

815
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:48,559
company's being able to buy unnamed

816
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:52,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">attendants to all nanog for a year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

817
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:54,439
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> headcount like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NTT has 23 people here</font>

818
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,939
like what do they could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy you</font>

819
00:36:54,439 --> 00:37:01,279
know 20 people per nanog 43 nanog the

820
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:03,319
cup front and many companies would do

821
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:06,160
that maybe not NTT or maybe not google

822
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:09,288
but like companies that are owned by

823
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,209
people who know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of nanog and</font>

824
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:13,279
control a medium sized group of people

825
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:15,589
who go to nanog they could buy like

826
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:16,819
three or four or five<font color="#E5E5E5"> seats and editors</font>

827
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:18,709
so that would generate some money did

828
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,029
you guys exclude that from this rate

829
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:22,578
just didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it on this projection</font>

830
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:25,819
it didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the on the pro</font>

831
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:28,160
forma<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bap that around and</font>

832
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:29,599
the so be sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if you</font>

833
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,219
guys thought it was a bad idea or it's

834
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,900
just Tennyson<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there not sure if it</font>

835
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:33,730
generates enough cash<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it would</font>

836
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,350
generate a moderate

837
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,180
cash like on the order of one to two

838
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:39,759
hundred thousand you think it's a great

839
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:42,220
idea we didn't present it because we

840
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,700
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce as little change as</font>

841
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,660
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are all</font>

842
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,069
decisions that we'd like to have in the

843
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,779
working groups okay because there's

844
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,940
there's a lot of there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

845
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,770
when you start talking with how you know

846
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,450
what might influence the attendance a

847
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,940
bunch of the other numbers go in weird

848
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,230
directions I understand so please don't

849
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,880
drop that one on the floor cuz I think

850
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:04,030
it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea no and and hope</font>

851
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,650
it wasn't mine and and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole thing</font>

852
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,420
about the companies wanting to write a

853
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,590
larger check up front that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ties back and</font>

854
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,260
I'm like doing the whole metallic

855
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:15,250
labeled corporate sponsorships because a

856
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,540
lot of our a lot of the experiences that

857
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,940
the marketing working group has come up

858
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,859
with is yeah well the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> small little</font>

859
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,830
marketing elements here and there are

860
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:26,290
interesting to some of our corporate

861
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,640
friends a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just want you know</font>

862
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:30,130
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just give you a check and I'm</font>

863
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,720
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the year yep so on the</font>

864
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,400
marketing issue and then I'll sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

865
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,629
and shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> up but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say this</font>

866
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think other people of</font>

867
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,260
Saturn and I know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of other people</font>

868
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,190
are thinking and having<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked mostly on</font>

869
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the program I think it um we must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

870
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:47,080
way to completely insulate the program

871
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,880
committee from your marketing activities

872
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,830
and it's been done effectively until now

873
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,540
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we have a really robust</font>

874
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,850
culture around that but some of that

875
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,500
culture needs to be carefully and trying

876
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,990
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization's and the policies</font>

877
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,790
we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know you can see it</font>

878
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,020
around the room when<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps earlier</font>

879
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,090
today there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

880
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,740
marketing content than people expected

881
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,720
in a little bit less technical content

882
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,209
than we are used to people get angry and

883
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,890
upset because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we win this is a great</font>

884
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,960
conference because of the quality of the

885
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,490
technical talks that are selected by the

886
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,700
program committee and recruited by them

887
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:21,970
so we just please continue to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

888
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,950
a priority and keep sort of jackass

889
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,720
serious engineers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program</font>

890
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,640
committee who will you know pee all over

891
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,770
the marketing toxin rejected I'm sorry

892
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,660
decline them thank you I mean it was

893
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:35,140
even suggested at one point I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure</font>

894
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:37,420
if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it into the next ideas for</font>

895
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,940
the bylaw committee to kick around to

896
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:43,320
actually encode<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the marketing group</font>

897
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,900
and PC couldn't have members that were

898
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,930
cross pollinating<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a clarification</font>

899
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:53,100
question that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Martin of these</font>

900
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:55,080
revenue items which of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

901
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,549
exists in their current form and their

902
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">current prices and which ones are these</font>

903
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:02,700
are news I'm guessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the top</font>

904
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:05,040
what for no top three chunks and the

905
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,169
meeting sponsors that's all what exists

906
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,540
and include everything meeting sponsors

907
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:12,420
and down is what exists and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

908
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:15,390
making an assumption of you know 350

909
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,580
paid out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the 450 attendees</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gotcha</font>

910
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,859
everything above that everything above

911
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,529
is all new stuff and every all those

912
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:24,240
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are for the entire year correct</font>

913
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,160
correct each column represents a year

914
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,259
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it ticks off the the</font>

915
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,310
meetings up at the top oh boy wolf so

916
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,320
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 48 49 50 yields a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and ten</font>

year to you have 220 in year 3 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 30</font>

919
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,350
well we'll get there when we get to the

920
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:45,390
expenses even<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow yeah sorry no mistake</font>

921
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,710
from kevin wallace you you may already

922
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,779
have this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think might help</font>

923
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,180
the people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual a graph</font>

924
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,910
with the cash flow on it just in pure

925
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:58,259
picture format and because that's what I

926
00:40:53,910 --> 00:41:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">think everyone's asking about yeah I</font>

927
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,130
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do that right now but</font>

928
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,440
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can probably have it we</font>

929
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:08,550
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it before them so far</font>

930
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,280
maybe what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean by cash flow cash</font>

931
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:14,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">flow in my background</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a month by</font>

932
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,870
month in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and out flow what are you</font>

933
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,670
envision<font color="#CCCCCC"> about stuff I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what I</font>

934
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,500
mean saucers I know exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

935
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Neil means because we do this on other</font>

936
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,940
boards were together okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show you</font>

937
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,440
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he means and he's right it actually</font>

938
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,690
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually would help so good</font>

939
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,300
suggestion you will put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on the</font>

940
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:36,090
new dog website sooner or later it if

941
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:37,980
Sylvia prison<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay nobody else at the</font>

942
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:44,010
mic so i went ahead and pop this on to

943
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:46,380
the exciting expense sheet the staffing

944
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:49,500
we're assuming that we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to pick</font>

945
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:52,290
up and you know the weave batted around

946
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,280
executive director as the title

947
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:57,009
assuming it's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone in the</font>

948
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,620
80 to 100 k range to actually have the

949
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:01,990
experience and fundraising experience

950
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,460
and organizational experience and this

951
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:07,509
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> we presume we would have to have</font>

952
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">them for half the year additionally we</font>

953
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,810
put line<font color="#E5E5E5"> on is for support staff whether</font>

954
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:14,290
or not that's correct hey this is a pro

955
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:16,450
forma like like RS pointed out so the

956
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:21,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the numbers will need to be tuned as</font>

957
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:23,560
appropriate various legal fees a lot of

958
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">front loading for doing things involving</font>

959
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:32,310
all the contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and getting things</font>

960
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:35,800
started this year you know these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

961
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:42,220
pretty straight forward estimates based

962
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:46,860
on simple simple exceptions of a small

963
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:46,859
small footprint operating organization

964
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:54,279
let's see promotional material what else

965
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:58,240
needs really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be called out the hotel</font>

966
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,460
costs we worked that out from that was

967
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,759
from historical data like it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

968
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we took high and low</font>

969
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,240
and then did an average of those defined

970
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:09,790
kind of a baseline just a number to work

971
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,290
with sorry now with Craig on just one

972
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,759
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was missing is travel</font>

973
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously these meetings are all over</font>

974
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> place you're gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to budget</font>

975
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:20,589
for travel well under a contracting

976
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:24,100
model for conference services that's

977
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:26,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the contract I i think what Neil</font>

978
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,630
was meaning is actually for the for the

979
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:30,820
tiny number of staff there's still a

980
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:33,060
modicum of travel we need to end<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

981
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,060
point

982
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:44,660
and this is what Sylvia was mentioning

983
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:49,839
that we rolling up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual summary</font>

984
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:52,038
income side of things people already

985
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:56,180
went over the gold silver bronze

986
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:59,680
assumptions so if you if you disagreed

987
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,680
there then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to disagree here</font>

988
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:08,718
give everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance to stare at the</font>

989
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:12,229
numbers everybody stared<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cash out</font>

990
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:15,079
the other again the the the previous

991
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:19,218
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides were showing the UM the items and</font>

992
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:20,660
estimates in terms of a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of units</font>

993
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:22,609
and this is actually translating that

994
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,410
into dollars so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where Sylvia's</font>

995
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:26,299
mission we actually get to something

996
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:34,160
approximating an annual cash flow kind

997
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:35,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">of kind of detail not sure if there's</font>

998
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,098
anything here that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

999
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:39,799
called Alice just one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing on the</font>

1000

come back and say you shouldn't have

1013
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,650
given this stuff to nanog and you know

1014

there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> people like that running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

1016
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,739
better off and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why the line</font>

1017
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:27,049

numbers bill<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I guess I'm just trying</font>

1023
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:53,559
to understand so there's an entire year

1024
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:55,690
of bookkeeper and accounting where the

1025
00:45:53,559 --> 00:46:02,710
cost is twelve hundred and five thousand

1026
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:05,049
dollars um steak<font color="#CCCCCC"> and brown this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pro</font>

1027
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,479
forma<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I guess that just jumps out</font>

1028
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:13,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">of me make me ask the question where did</font>

1029
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:15,339
these numbers come from some are hard

1030
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:16,479
estimates based on actual based on

1031
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,219
research things like some of the

1032
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:19,689
conference consulate conference

1033
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:22,869
cancellation insurance things like that

1034
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:25,059
and some of them are our swag I mean

1035
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:28,630
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is a performer where we're</font>

1036
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:30,369
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that the faults so if</font>

1037
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,599
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> requires</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more detail er</font>

1038
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,249
you think that's too high or too low

1039
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,150
then some specifics would be useful

1040
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:40,029
though the legal and the accounting fees

1041
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:41,829
are what typically a professional

1042
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:45,279
accountant will charge to review your

1043
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:47,890
balance sheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and produce your tax every</font>

1044
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:50,349
year for a small organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1045
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,118
remember we are a small organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1046
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:58,509
that's well within range it's about

1047
00:46:52,119 --> 00:47:00,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">4,000 so we put five legal fees for the</font>

1048
00:46:58,509 --> 00:47:03,279
moment we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the legal fees for free</font>

1049
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:05,379
but the first year is there's a lot of

1050
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:09,400
incorporation work to be to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

1051
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:11,170
especially with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 501c3 so we that's</font>

1052
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,559
why the number is higher on the first

1053
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:19,119
year and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan for having</font>

1054
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:22,569
just regular legal a bucket for legal

1055
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,539
fees just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to toss in</font>

1056
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:28,538
the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> fees being free really means</font>

1057
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:36,849
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were generously donated by tom</font>

daley and dine incorporated Tom and I'm

1059
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:40,450
glad you guys brought that up because I

1060
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,789
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk for a second about the</font>

1061
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:45,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">legal fees because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're a</font>

1062
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:47,049
sign of something that's more important

1063
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:49,089
lingering in here that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

1064
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are thinking consciously about</font>

1065
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:51,520
the

1066
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,770
a very different sense of responsibility

1067
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:57,390
and participation that comes out of a

member owned and operated organization

1069
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,328
that makes people especially at the

beginning in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of spirit of</font>

structure to to organize and take in

1083
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:33,160
those contributions so that if somebody

1084
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,440
has an accountant on their staff and

1085
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,089
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like help do some</font>

1097
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:00,160
but the organizational stuff you guys

pick up their tchotchkes so considering

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're talking about sponsors right now</font>

let's not piss them off if anybody you

1118
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,589
know let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep it going and won't</font>

1119
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,359
get to you yeah now that we've beaten up

1120
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:45,009
some of the line items initially

1121
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,270
hopefully it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more clear as we go</font>

1122
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,400
through this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one where we're</font>

1123
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,470
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the pessimistic numbers</font>

1124
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,059
which actually curiously enough wound up

1125
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,220
you know usually do these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try</font>

1126
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:55,930
to cook the break-even numbers when we

1127
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:59,618
made pessimistic assumptions we still

1128
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:01,690
made it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the break even minor might</font>

1129
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:02,390
like a 10k negative you'll see at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1130
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,180
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1131
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,500
this is the overview the summary that we

1132
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of blew through on the other on the</font>

1133
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:15,170
other set but just you know absorb that

1135
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:19,940
said earlier so you're pessimistic view

1136
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:23,598
is that corporate sponsorships go up

1137
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:31,910
forty two percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> no you're ready that</font>

1138
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:36,589

just a bullet<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerPoint feature that is</font>

1141
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:47,349
just a bullet bill it's the same one

1142
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:49,849
that's been through all these slides

1143
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:54,380
that's just that's just breaking out

1144
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:56,960
what they are and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1145
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:59,150
want us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all get eyestrain staring at</font>

1146
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,890
at things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is when we're saying</font>

1147
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,890
pessimistic we're seriously pessimistic

1148
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:07,660
are our membership drive is not that

1149
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:10,640
good we we don't get as many of the as

1150
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:13,339
the ongoing sponsors we screw up in

1151
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:18,140
meeting registrations we only get 250

1152
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:22,880
paid people we cranked down all the

1153
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:26,180
sponsorship values you know absorb

1154
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,539
absorb no no nothing's nothing's looking

1155
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:32,149
rosy here and the expenses we actually

1156
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:34,190
maintained so that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it even worse</font>

1157
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:36,710
that the number was going our revenues

1158
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,180
going down we didn't we did we normally

1159
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,859
you have a smaller conference you would

1160
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,410
book a smaller hotel we presume we

1161
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:45,170
screwed that up too and we still booked

1162
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:47,899
big hotels so you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the same</font>

1163
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:53,900
same footprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs for the actual</font>

1164
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">event I do I sense a question coming yes</font>

1165
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,750
Charles Cochran Robin axles um I'm

1166
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:04,640
trying to work through the numbers based

1167
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:06,170
off of and I do commend everyone for

1168
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,118
putting this together I think it's a

1169
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">great initiative I think it's the right</font>

1170
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:12,330
thing to do but I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correlate</font>

1171
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,370
it from hacen

1172
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:17,190
years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand I have to take it</font>

1173
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:19,020
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a grain of salt the numbers given</font>

1174
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:22,710
in the presentation from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other day</font>

1175
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:25,380
from merit but there is numbers in here

1176
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:29,430
for equipment and supplies there's stuff

1177
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:31,220
for as mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the travel but</font>

1178
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:34,169
there's also non-salary type

1179
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:38,100
expenditures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to equate is</font>

1180
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:41,910
the non-salary the hotel registration

1181
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:44,610
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non salary is what you</font>

1182
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:47,520
see their hotel costs equipment costs

1183
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:49,680
supplies and also travel but the

1184
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,030
equipment costs are reoccurring is that

1185
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,950
an assumption that we're renting

1186
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:55,620
equipment or that the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

1187
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:56,819
purchased the equipment and what's

1188
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,009
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the equipment that's</font>

1189
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:02,940
already been purchased on behalf of the

1190
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:05,340
organization every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single meeting there</font>

1191
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,950
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> item for if you look past in the</font>

1192
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">community meetings it's about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen to</font>

1193
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:12,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty thousand for equipment so we kept</font>

1194
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same number and we upped it we put</font>

1195
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">it at 20 which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the highest value</font>

1196
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've seen but is that an assumption</font>

1197
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:21,690
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying new equipment again</font>

1198
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:23,970
were we saying yes I mean like you know

1199
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:27,390
that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this this all this AV stuff</font>

1200
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:29,009
well that's that's a cost money it

1201
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,629
doesn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> show up those were really</font>

1202
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs that we carried forward from the</font>

1203
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:35,010
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we got from from merit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1204
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,360
and so they may or may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be exactly</font>

1205
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,040
the way that would look<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the new</font>

1206
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,450
organization but we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry the</font>

1207
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,540
cost as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could so that it</font>

1208
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:46,520
looked realistic so one of the things we

1209
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:49,080
offered was to sell equipment that we

1210
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:51,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any need for through the</font>

1211
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:55,020
universe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michigan proper disposal office</font>

1212
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:58,350
which will discount it appropriately and

1213
00:53:55,020 --> 00:54:01,650
so forth so nu nog are going to decide

1214
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:04,529
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they want to buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that or</font>

1215
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,360
they'd rather just buy new and they're

1216
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:09,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make those decisions but that</font>

1217
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:11,340
offer is on the table for that equipment

1218
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as Patrick was pointing out a bunch</font>

1219
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:15,690
of the detail about those specifics are

1220
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:18,500
in the letters<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are all posted on</font>

1221
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,500
the new narc site

1222
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:26,349
so we're being careful not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1223
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:28,449
underestimate any cost any<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-value</font>

1224
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:32,439
week to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick the highest value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at every</font>

1225
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:34,299
single point I'm Mike use links and PC

1226
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:37,058
mother um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just also wanted to point</font>

1227
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:38,469
out stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and obsolete and you</font>

1228
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:39,819
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cranky if we don't have</font>

1229
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:42,219
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like draft and support and</font>

1230
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:44,829
another cool stuff when you know that

1231
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:46,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we give equipment does</font>

1232
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:48,819
need to be refreshed and updated because

1233
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:52,118
it gets broken sometimes or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

1234
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:54,749
out a lot obsolete especially equipment

1235
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:57,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's shuffled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around hither and yon</font>

1236
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:59,618
another clarification question with the

1237
00:54:57,069 --> 00:55:02,380
staffing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sylvie are you assuming that</font>

1238
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:04,209
these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully loaded costs so this</font>

1239
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:07,239
90 k is really a person is probably

1240
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:08,589
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> 65 70 there's benefits and health</font>

1241
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:11,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">care and that kind of stuff there's a</font>

1242
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:14,979
line item<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris just bass comp and so</font>

1243
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:17,769
the real number yes you'll see that the

1244
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:19,928
benefits actually so there I I went a

1245
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:22,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">little fast I'm sorry on putting the</font>

1246
00:55:19,929 --> 00:55:24,279
assumptions there I just want it because

1247
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:26,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we had was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proforma and I</font>

1248
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:29,499
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to highlight all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the assumptions</font>

1249
00:55:26,229 --> 00:55:31,178
because this is unreadable yeah and it's

1250
00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:33,428
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard to compress it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

1251
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:35,349
something so yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the loaded costs</font>

1252
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:37,119
were soon to be you know benefits the

1253
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:40,299
the typical swag of a third very

1254
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">personal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the of the salary okay and</font>

1255
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:46,809
these people are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an office</font>

1256
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:51,099
somewhere yes or they are on a contract

1257
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:52,479
basis so one of the the things people

1258
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:54,819
have been asking about is there's been a

1259
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:56,819
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gear that was donated to merit</font>

1260
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:58,900
for the purposes of nanog for example

1261
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:01,179
Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush was involved with with</font>

1262
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,949
getting some new servers and it hasn't

1263
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:04,809
been clear whether that gear is going to

1264
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:07,059
get moved over to the new organization

1265
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:08,799
or if that's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say the letters</font>

1266
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:10,209
Merritt will sell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us at a</font>

1267
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:13,209
discounted rate based on their

1268
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:14,678
technology disbursement<font color="#E5E5E5"> department's</font>

1269
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:21,489
decision of how much that equipment is

1270
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:23,739
worth couple light<font color="#CCCCCC"> onions who are you no</font>

1271
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:25,289
no Tim Charles got<font color="#CCCCCC"> rigor well no it's</font>

1272
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:28,710
gonna say lets him go tell lets it go

1273
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:31,230
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I please</font>

1274
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:36,270
yeah he's identify yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some call</font>

1275
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:40,530
me too I'm tempos are I'm independent

1276
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:42,359
geek a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things one thing is that</font>

1277
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:44,430
the credit card transaction seems that

1278
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:46,500
two percent seems a little low just as a

1279
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:48,960
point of interest more like three

1280
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,119
percent where the line ms for the

1292
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:23,790
everything the spreadsheet will be four

1293
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:26,069
pages long but we can totally do it what

1294
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:27,330
am I Beenie obviously I've had some

1295
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:30,030
experience in this area would be

1296
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:31,859
interesting just to see if there again

1297
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:34,859
in the ballpark but yeah these are these

1298

<font color="#E5E5E5">know if the salaried individual would</font>

have that type of responsibility or they

1334
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:14,420
just basically setting its own the

00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:22,640
services selection or those professional

1338
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:23,689
organizations yeah they the executive

1339
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,180
director would be the person that's

1340

actually you know managing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RFP is</font>

00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:34,190
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna make the point that</font>

1344
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,540
we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about an organization</font>

1345
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:37,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn over a million</font>

1346
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:39,079
dollars and staying up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talking</font>

1347
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,790
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a single digit or less</font>

percentages of the total budget is not

1349
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:50,150
particularly useful at this stage thank

1350
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:51,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">you thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you I Steve Gibbard apologies</font>

1351
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,000
and jumping the gun unless that's coming

1352
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:55,460
later in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program or anything like</font>

1353
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,339
that but she wanted to point out we've

1354
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,839
got a lot of numbers up here in both the

1355
00:59:58,339 --> 01:00:03,740
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> case in the worst case scenarios</font>

1356
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:05,359
that assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are running meetings</font>

1357
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:08,930
and have a staff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go deal with the</font>

1358
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:10,369
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth and there's quite a</font>

1359
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:13,310
bit that needs to happen before we get

1360
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:14,690
to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding is a</font>

1361
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:18,020
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people on this transition team</font>

1362
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:19,099
have put in some money already I handed

1363
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,680
over a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-hundred-dollar check</font>

1364
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:22,910
yesterday Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush handed over his two</font>

1365
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,970
hundred and fifty dollar check at the

1366
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of this and I think if other</font>

1367
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:30,439
people in this rear and other people who

1368
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:31,759
think that this is a good idea could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1369
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,619
something similar I think that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1370
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,510
a long way towards getting this off the

1371
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:37,510
ground thanks Steve

1372
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:45,630
Kevin over- yes net I once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1373
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:47,549
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at spreadsheets and have a lot</font>

1374
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:50,070
of stuff rolled up into categories and

1375
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:51,750
there's been lots of questions about the

1376
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:53,580
items what's rolled up where or was it

1377
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:55,650
overlooked things like that I think it

1378
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:58,080
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very good if the steering</font>

1379
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:00,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee or well I'm not sure exactly</font>

1380
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,520
what the organization name is

1381
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:04,260
appropriately for new dog but anyway if

1382
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,590
whomever up there who does the work

1383
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">solely could make available online</font>

1384
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:12,090
preferably the detailed<font color="#E5E5E5"> spreadsheets so</font>

1385
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,910
everybody can satisfy themselves that

1386
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:17,640
there are no major items significance

1387
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:19,410
that got missed or artists<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee out of</font>

1388
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,000
line it would be a really good idea yeah

1389
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,500
i I don't I don't know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1390
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,520
guarantee to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the meeting</font>

1391
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,680
but we're gonna do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as soon as</font>

1392
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:29,759
possible yes you could give me maybe a

1393
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:33,419
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'd be nice I gotta set some</font>

1394
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">limits is it sober but you're willing to</font>

1395
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,800
give yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I do think the sooner</font>

1396
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:39,240
the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't expect you</font>

1397
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,980
to spend all night tonight getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1398
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,020
out online that would be kind of silly

1399
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,820
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see them out there</font>

1400
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,740
as soon as possible so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can have time</font>

1401
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:48,330
to adequately study them and more

1402
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:50,160
importantly let people who understand

1403
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:52,500
numbers better than I do on financial

1404
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,600
sheets study them<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do two</font>

1405
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,400
different things either we publish the

1406
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:01,470
sheet that we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a</font>

1407
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:06,180
working she that we have or but we have

1408
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:08,759
rolled up categories and I i guess that

1409
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:10,910
solution would not satisfy the deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

1410
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,770
curious that wants to see all the items

1411
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:17,149
but it would be conveying information

1412
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:19,890
right away and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give me after that</font>

1413
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:24,690
seven or ten days to totally break it

1414
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:27,080
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as well personally I</font>

1415
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:29,250
think seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ten days is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine</font>

1416
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:34,350
three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably i'd be very</font>

1417
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:36,480
annoyed oh yeah damn I I think one thing

1418
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:39,810
that's important here is this is a this

1419
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,100
is a directionally accurate budget the

1420
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:44,040
reason this budget was done was to

1421
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:47,040
determine if this was doable or not so

1422
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:48,020
you know it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a check or an X</font>

1423
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,759
and

1424
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:52,490
gotten sort of to a check this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1425
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,500
directly accurate you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the numbers</font>

1426
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:56,660
add up properly I think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1427
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a matter of iteration in other words</font>

1428
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,370
we've got this now I think 90 days from

1429
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,580
now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a much more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Iker</font>

1430
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:06,620
budget in another 90 days we'll have yet

1431
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:08,509
another motor acura budget and in a year

1432
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:10,730
to 18 months will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to sort</font>

1433
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:12,980
of an annual budget cycle where a budget

1434
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:15,800
gets sent out at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1435
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:18,830
you know it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 95 to ninety percent</font>

1436
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,200
accurate you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a 12-month period</font>

1437
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,250
thereafter I I think at this point I

1438
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">think people need to set their</font>

1439
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:26,330
expectations if they look at this budget

1440
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:28,340
and think that full months from now when

1441
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:29,630
this gets gone over that this is going

1442
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:32,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate it's not going to be</font>

1443
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:35,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">accurate you know this this is a first</font>

1444
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:37,879
pass and it's only directionally

1445
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:39,770
accurate so what we're going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1446
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,110
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people here belong to a</font>

1447
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:44,480
homeowner's association so good number

1448
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:47,030
of people now you get this long boring

1449
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,280
homeowners association budget like every

1450
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,360
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what this is going to turn</font>

1451
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,340
into and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look a lot like</font>

1452
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,050
it it's kind of line items and the line

1453
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,610
items are going to the same your career

1454
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:57,770
the reason people know how to build

1455
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:59,870
those budgets is they steal them from

1456
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:01,190
other homeowners associations or the

1457
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,660
developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done that and gives it to</font>

1458
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:04,880
you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you figure out year after</font>

1459
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,230
year so there's two things we have to be

1460
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,330
one is we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn by making a few</font>

1461
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:10,940
mistakes and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we need</font>

1462
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:13,640
to learn by talking to folks or some

1463
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:18,020
other associations and doing a doing a

1464
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:19,850
few you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just qualifying it and you</font>

1465
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,560
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you just start checking out</font>

1466
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:28,160
with people from other associations but

1467
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:30,290
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will come I'm sorry I I</font>

1468
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,270
think that's a good idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in</font>

1469
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:33,380
mind with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all due respect sir a lot of</font>

1470
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:35,540
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the steering committee on</font>

1471
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transition group have been doing it</font>

1472
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:38,750
for a long time in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

1473
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:40,910
planning I think there's a good number

1474
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:42,860
of people involved who have done event

1475
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:46,430
planning for living and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know exactly</font>

1476
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:47,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">how much stuff costs so if you look at</font>

1477
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and say well these are your</font>

1478
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,900
selective amateurs would be right to be

1479
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:52,790
concerned if you look at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

1480
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">well they've bought in people who</font>

1481
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:57,660
successfully run very profitable events

1482
01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:00,089
past or who<font color="#E5E5E5"> no accounting or who've been</font>

1483
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,190
involved with other organizations they

1484
01:05:00,089 --> 01:05:04,200
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> said it but they have and I</font>

1485
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,430
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should keep that in mind dan</font>

1486
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,710
are you saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm just going to</font>

1487
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,868

fairly strong you guys may want to

1515
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:18,180
consider though that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us have</font>

1516
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:20,309
only come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to speed on what's going on</font>

1517
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:22,200
here relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon so this is the</font>

1518
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:24,710
first time we're seeing these numbers so

1519
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,970
it might be asking some you know

1520
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:28,650
specific questions as kind of a

1521
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:30,180
clarification because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

1522
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:32,849
getting up to speed on a lot of this

1523
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:35,430
stuff we're told that this is actually a

1524
01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:37,920
done deal that we're going to be voting

1525
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:40,319
on it in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> months but this is</font>

1526
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:43,710
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a done deal so I guess there's</font>

1527
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:46,170
just so much turmoil here and what it is

1528
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:48,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is done and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all going</font>

1529
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:51,029
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and what the assumptions are in</font>

1530
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:54,089
the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this uncomfortable</font>

1531
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:57,869
feeling that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really know what</font>

1532
01:06:54,089 --> 01:07:00,089
the hell we're doing here I don't thank

1533
01:06:57,869 --> 01:07:01,970
you Bill when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're appreciate that can</font>

1534
01:07:00,089 --> 01:07:04,009
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike's questionable</font>

1535
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:05,660
I don't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't get the turmoil</font>

1536
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:10,670
but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting but you know I</font>

1537
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:13,310
obviously have a view by us here there's

1538
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:16,010
not so much a done deal as the fact that

1539
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:18,200
there are there as we said yesterday

1540
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:20,500
there were timers on contracts that had

1541
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,910
to be hit and when we started

1542
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:26,020
discussions with merit about how to do

1543
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:28,609
things they had a right and correct

1544
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:32,810
responsibility to their shareholders to

1545
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:38,090
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> cautious and that translates to us</font>

1546
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:40,849
having to pony up and so we did there is

1547
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:43,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">in fact a done deal to me when you say</font>

1548
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:45,710
that contracts have been signed that

1549
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,359
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and I see a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

1550
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:49,520
of merit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steering committee</font>

1551
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:51,290
we're all nodding saying yes this is

1552
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,599
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward so this is a done deal I</font>

1553
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:54,590
think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what's going on I</font>

1554
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know that I care about the</font>

1555
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:59,630
specific numbers but I see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1556
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:02,900
these assumptions that I think are

1557
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:04,730
highly questionable the sources of

1558
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:06,920
revenue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you had that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top half of</font>

1559
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:08,359
that page of revenues that was a pretty

1560
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,280
substantial chunk of what you're saying

1561
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:14,270
is going to cover the future of nanog

1562
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:16,219
but those are all untested untried you

1563
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:17,630
have a group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks who I mean there</font>

1564
01:08:16,219 --> 01:08:19,850
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some expertise and no that's</font>

1565
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:23,450
beyond engineering but I don't see the

1566
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:25,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of you know business focus with</font>

1567
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:27,589
multiple disciplines that you'd expect

1568
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:30,620
to see in a startup company that would

1569
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:32,450
in fact be funded so I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

1570
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,160
sounds out any negative i guess it's

1571
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:36,580
just more you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask me what the</font>

1572
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:38,899
turmoil is in my mind the turmoil is

1573
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:41,330
just something doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound quite right</font>

1574
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:43,399
about this startup that you're talking

1575
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">about with a new nanog and maybe a lone</font>

1576
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:46,460
fold I hope Dan's going to tell me

1577
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:48,140
everything's going to be fine we've done

1578
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,790
the numbers we've done thousands of

1579
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,140
conferences amongst this group of folks

1580
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:54,109
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as I can tell there's only</font>

1581
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:56,089
one group that's actually done these

1582
01:08:54,109 --> 01:08:57,650
types of conference on an ongoing basis

1583
01:08:56,089 --> 01:09:00,439
and all the disciplines required and

1584
01:08:57,649 --> 01:09:05,509
that would be merit hey you say that is

1585
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:07,219
a former merit employee bill come on no

1586
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:09,439
I know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the reason I say that</font>

1587
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:11,660
bill is because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what you said</font>

1588
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,089
was it was largely a cheap shot

1589
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:16,099
I mean the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that maybe you feel</font>

1590
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:17,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're consulted or something but there</font>

1591
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,190
have been a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who've been</font>

1592
01:09:17,569 --> 01:09:21,200
bought into this beyond the people who

1593
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:24,410
are up on the stage who do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1594
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,970
experience who are who are CEOs who have

1595
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,189
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of executive experience running</font>

1596
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:29,960
yes technology companies they've been

1597
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:31,879
people but in who spent a lot of time

1598
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,890
running events these<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font>

1599
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,690
stuff ities will pluck out of here<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

1600
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:37,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> being said I don't think they're</font>

1601
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:38,779
one hundred percent accurate I mean I'll

1602
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,800
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one to say I don't think</font>

1603
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:44,059
they're hundred percent accurate but I

1604
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:46,730
do think that I don't think this is a

1605
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:50,720
done deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I do think that you can't</font>

1606
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:51,799
sort of throw stones and the way your

1607
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,550
senior throwing them because I don't

1608
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you're being particularly</font>

1609
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:57,110
constructive if you have a suggestion

1610
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:59,650
for what to do make it but I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1611
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:01,790
what you're doing is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wrong</font>

1612
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:04,150
specifically I think there's an easy way

1613
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:06,830
to move forward and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is have that</font>

1614
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:09,290
volunteers running this thing but

1615
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:11,690
perhaps have this new organization be

1616
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:13,700
simply a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass-through where the first</font>

hiring merit to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so you get the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">control that you guys want and you</font>

1621

continue the continuity with

organization that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this for</font>

a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then yes you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can certainly</font>

1624
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:28,760
outsource to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative organization</font>

1625
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:30,769
but I'm a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

1626
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,510
adding a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more costs already not the</font>

1627
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:34,670
only one that's gonna say howdy how do

1628
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:39,740
you describe us hiring merit as not

1629
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:41,870
outsource ah yes that's what we have

1630
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:45,500
been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about please my we're</font>

getting down to 13 minutes friend provo

1632
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,180
comcast and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to applaud all of you</font>

1633
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:52,070
on the stage because you have been

1634
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:54,050
answering questions on the mailing list

1635
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,849
much like bills bringing up again today

1636
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I know many people answered his</font>

1637
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:00,620
questions on the mailing list weeks ago

ago including<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

new yourself dug out of the archives

1641

that's been bantered about<font color="#E5E5E5"> for years I</font>

1642
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:11,240
think there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a transparency issue</font>

1643
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,889
with merit and unfortunately we have not

1644
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to overcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the past five</font>

01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:18,050
years since the major transition period

1646
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:19,880
this makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I understand all</font>

1647
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:21,680
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers are swags they should be</font>

at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're upset about this</font>

1649
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,220
seeming like it's a done deal they've

1650
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:27,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken a swag</font>

1651

put out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> brainstorm for the</font>

01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:33,710
collective audience here that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1653
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:36,140
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we elected our leadership on the</font>

1654
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:38,450
stage to do the right thing to steer us

1655
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:40,190
in the right direction this is the way

1656
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:42,500
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moving towards a little bit</font>

1657
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:44,599
more self-governance we shouldn't be

1658
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,150
waiting another four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years that</font>

01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:53,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">won't fix any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our issues today it may</font>

1660
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:55,549
make them worse I think we can agree on

1661
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:57,440
the broad<font color="#E5E5E5"> strokes I'll grant you that I</font>

1662
01:11:55,550 --> 01:12:00,230
guess the reason I'm hot under the

1663
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,580
collar van is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I don't like the</font>

1664
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:03,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that this thing came forward I think</font>

1665
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:06,950
we could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a lot better job on</font>

1666
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:08,960
the marriage side and on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vsc side I</font>

1667
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">think if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a documentation trail</font>

1668
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,410
for what the issues were that led us

1669
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,470
down this path then you'd have the

1670

entire audience the entire membership

1671
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:19,370

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in hand saying yes this is the</font>
