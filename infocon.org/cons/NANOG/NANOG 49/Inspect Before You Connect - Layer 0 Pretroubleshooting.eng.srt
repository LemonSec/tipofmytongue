about for several years however only in

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,640
the past few years is it really gaining

15

a lot of recognition and appreciation

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,010
and that has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do with maintaining the</font>

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,970
briefly give an overview of dis

00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,629
about and the tools associated with that

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,489
then transition into a fiber optic

24
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,979

29
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,429
can clarify some of that with you with

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,270
inspecting fiber connectors you need a

51
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:08,369
microscope we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with 125</font>

52
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,780
microns or smaller so you can't

53
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,840
necessarily use your human eye to look

54
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">at that the one that's most common in a</font>

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,489
field environment are the probe scopes

56
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,840
down at the bottom as opposed to the

something that you use an

benchtop lab environment more so

60
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,790
something that allows you to inspect

61
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">both sides like a probe microscope just</font>

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,030
microscopes these it's a really

64
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">versatile tool just in that it can be</font>

65
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to inspect any kind of connector</font>

66
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,510
whether it's located as a patch cord or

67
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,879
located behind the bulkhead and that

68
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,670
could be ranging anywhere from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

69
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,159
simple single fiber SC connector or

70
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,250
something to more complex connectors

71
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,440
like an MTP multi-fiber ribbon connector

72
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,670
or something you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optical device</font>

00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,349
located on a card or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something just a</font>

quick overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just of where</font>

75
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,569
inspection is done I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can wrap this up</font>

76
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:07,639
basically just by saying that inspection

77
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,828
is really done whenever fiber optic

78
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:13,340
connectors are handled and that breaks

79
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:16,280
out into a wide assortment of different

80
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,190
kinds of applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> show here I'm</font>

81
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:24,379
a transition into fiber optic connectors

82
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:26,569
we you know network managers love the

83
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:29,510
whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a connector just because</font>

84
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason they exist is to give you</font>

85
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,720
flexibility it gives you those the

86
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,519
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have moods that moves as and</font>

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,900
changes as we all know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so with that</font>

88
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,430
we love that but at the same time you

89
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,230
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the bad and</font>

90
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,599
there's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are certain things</font>

91
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you need to tend to know with with</font>

92
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,250
them as it pertains to your attenuation

93
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your in your loss insertion loss</font>

94
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,690
return loss and such it's important just

95
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,540
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> mindful of how you can get the</font>

96
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,510
best performance out of your connectors

97
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:02,000
so why is inspection<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important now</font>

98
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,608
than it was say ten years ago well

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,639
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing even like Tim and Matt</font>

100
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:11,269
talking the increasing higher bandwidth

101
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,819
requirements is driving driving us to a

102
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:15,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation where we we can't just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

103
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:18,709
we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ignore this and think oh</font>

104
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,599
yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks clean enough that</font>

105
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,169
it doesn't look black on the end of the

106
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:27,530
ceramic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Farrell I think it's good enough</font>

107
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:31,190
fortunately the service provider side of

108
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,780
the the industry has got about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a three</font>

109
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,270
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> four year jump in</font>

110
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,909
discovering this so a lot of a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

111
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problems that they experienced in</font>

112
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,230
the past few years have paved the way

113
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,380
for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have really good</font>

114
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,990
and efficient solutions for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our for our</font>

115
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,340
data center applications and one of the

116
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">other things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I that I think is</font>

117
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,119
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important right now is we're at a</font>

118
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,180
really good opportunity with regards to

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,550
technicians because probably one of the

120
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,200
newest things that's that you're seeing

121
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,840
right now and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry is</font>

122
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,169
actually new technicians so you've got

123
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,539
an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now to number one</font>

124
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,460
teach these technicians you know they'll

125
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,470
get them off on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right flow even</font>

126
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,060
though they have limited experience you

127
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,370
can teach them now to do things<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

128
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,030
and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time sometimes the folks</font>

129
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:22,730
that are a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more experienced</font>

130
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,590
carry along a lot of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad habits</font>

131
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,970
from several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths and so there's</font>

132
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,919
a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a learning curve going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on with</font>

133
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,720
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these folks just because it's</font>

134
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,760
something worked for them five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

135
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,070
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago one way that might not</font>

136
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,229
necessarily be as applicable with the

137
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,849
applications today so real quick I mean

138
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,039
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is anatomy of the connector you've</font>

139
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,990
got you know connector body which

140
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,190
basically houses a feral this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> SC</font>

141
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,530
connector I pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because it's</font>

142
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:50,390
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most commonly used but</font>

143
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:53,390
there's all sorts of them SCLC FC<font color="#E5E5E5"> MTP so</font>

144
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,789
on and so forth and then that actually

145
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,280

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think of that itself as the</font>

150
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,669
fiber but the fiber is actually the

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,530
ferrule then houses the fiber in the

152
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,909
very center of that so typically with

153
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,799
the naked eye it's actually pretty tough

154
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,140
to see if you tilt it out a right at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

155
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,340

158
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,780
taking that it down even a little bit

159
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,770
further<font color="#CCCCCC"> my for illustration purposes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,770
looks like but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually just</font>

transmit the transmits the light is

168
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,220
extremely small it's the there's no way

169
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,979
that you you could actually

170
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,580
any contamination really on that with

171
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:51,110
the naked eye and left the thing was

172
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,270
covering the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> feral or something</font>

173
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,790
and what we're talking about looking for

174
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,460
contamination the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> three four</font>

175
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:03,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">five micron which is impossible to see</font>

176
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:05,450
with the naked eye so<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick i did a took</font>

177
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,310
a microscope microscope shot here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

178
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,800
actually what that fiber looks like

179
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,690
through a microscope all that white area

180
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,880
around the edges is actually that white

181
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,670
ceramic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ferrell and then the big grey</font>

182
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,450
circle<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the fiber itself the cladding</font>

183
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:22,130
which is 125 microns now that said the

184
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">only part that actually transmits the</font>

185
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,210
light as many of you guys know is just

186
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the core of that right in the center</font>

187
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,380
whether that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> single-mode fiber which</font>

188
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,570
is roughly not<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight eight or nine</font>

189
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,040
microns or a multimode fiber which is

190
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,980
either fifty to sixty two and a half

191
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,510
microns here's an example of a 50 micron

192
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,060
I mean a single mode one which is around

193
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:43,520
nine microns so you can see here there's

194
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,590
a couple of freckles and spots and stuff

195
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,049
those are actually on microscopic

196
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:51,440
particles of contamination and we'll get

197
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:54,560
to that in a second I could just a quick

198
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,210
overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a what you might see as I</font>

199
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,950
just mentioned here's of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one on the</font>

200
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,719
left here is what a clean fiber

201
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,400
connection looks like with the white

202
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,590
ceramic around the edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the and the</font>

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cladding there in the corn the</font>

205
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,320
a ribbon connector many of you guys in

206
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,360
I'll contingent year in your in your

207
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,669
data centers might deal a bit with

208
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,360
ribbon connectors as they're on certain

209
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:19,820
devices which actually contains a ribbon

210
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,090
array of multiple fibers all on the same

211
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,520
connector ranging from anywhere from six

212
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,039
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve all the way up to 72 or more</font>

213
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,710
now these days I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really quick</font>

214
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,390
focusing on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection itself here's</font>

215
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,250
a just a cross-section of what what you

216
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,689
have going on in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection you've</font>

217
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,099
got the ferrule itself and then the

218
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,409
alignments sleeve in there that's

219
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,240
holding the ferrule in place that second

220
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,270
connector comes in and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they</font>

221
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,460
make physical contact so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned before that the connectors</font>

224
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,970
themselves are widely known as the

225
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,890
weakest and most problematic point in

226
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,220
the network I can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that love-hate</font>

228
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,149
they give us the flexibility at the same

time<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source for the</font>

biggest problems so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually makes</font>

231
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,469
a good connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> I break it down i call</font>

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to have that physical contact</font>

connector interface and these days the

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,790
first two you know five ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font>

little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention to and there</font>

241
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:33,829
were bigger factors but now with

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,750
zirconia ceramic<font color="#E5E5E5"> alignment sleeves and</font>

apex offset machines and such that just

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,189
your the manufacturers haven't been able

245
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,629

users don't have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

247
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:45,870
we're left<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something that's built</font>

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,550

with that it shows the the loss

number three though is this connector

288
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,010
down at the bottom which you see you go

289
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,400
from how<font color="#E5E5E5"> ya significant loss going all</font>

290
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,260
the way you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it's about 4.37</font>

291
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,110
DB loss associated with that connect or

292
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,340
not Matt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim were talking in their</font>

293
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">in their presentational putting together</font>

294
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,050
lost budgets which you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are familiar</font>

295
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:41,490
with a typical lost budget associated

296
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:44,319
with the connector is usually you know

297
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,610
point set<font color="#CCCCCC"> one point five DB max</font>

298
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes people a little bit more</font>

299
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,880
forgiving than that so when you get when

300
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,819
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a connection point that has four</font>

301
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,740
point three DB loss you got a problem

302
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you didn't budget for that the</font>

303
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,040
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this one you</font>

304
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,530
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that that connector is</font>

305
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,449
contaminated but the only thing that's

306
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,730
actually causing that loss you can see

307
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,950
in the very center the core that that

308
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,380
white spot there there's a few little

309
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,120
freckles on there those are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

310
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,400
parts that are causing the loss it's

311
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's looks like two</font>

312
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,959
particles there one is about five

313
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,180
microns and the others about<font color="#E5E5E5"> four three</font>

314
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,490
my three or four microns it's amazing

315
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,790
how something as microscopic as that can

316
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beat your biggest enemy so with</font>

317
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,300
that said it's interesting although

318
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,010
there's all that other contamination

319
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,349
around there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times people will</font>

320
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,120
think well if if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only part that's</font>

321
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,160
that I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

322
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,600
contaminant is the core being clean if I

323
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,990
can have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> filthy connector everywhere</font>

324
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,390
else and and it's it should be fine and

325
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it's kind of it's not fully</font>

326
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking the thing that through and I</font>

327
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,709
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give an example of that here's</font>

328
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,630
here's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest things that</font>

329
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,980
you'll see a phenomena with fiber

330
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,140
connectors is that the particles will

331
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,020
actually migrate over time i oftentimes

332
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,400
we like to use the example of like a

333
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,710
water balloon or even a hand grenade

334
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,069
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing explodes shrapnel</font>

335
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:11,680
goes everywhere and here's an example of

336
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,080
a connector that has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple fairly</font>

337
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,449
large particles of debris associated

338
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,850
with it out on the out on the periphery

339
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,930
now watch what happens after I've made

340
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,910
this one connect

341
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,949
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I inspected it again you can</font>

342
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,100
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that debris just explodes and</font>

343
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:30,040
goes everywhere hey the core is still

344
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">cleaned it's probably just still still</font>

345
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,180
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but you notice after the third</font>

346
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,620
connection all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

347
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,140
got contamination that moved in the core

348
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,810
the fourth one other than big chunk that

349
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:44,230
moved its way there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fifth one it</font>

350
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,869
even gets worse and so kind of all that

351
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,310
to say is there and there's no rhyme or

352
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,050
reason it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it migrates to the</font>

353
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,319
core it could go it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go anywhere</font>

354
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so associating that with loss this</font>

355
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,060
is kind of an interesting trend as well

356
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,920
watch how there's actually not even

357
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's not even any contamination on</font>

358
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,969
the core with any of these and then all

359
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,920
of a sudden with this one you get that

360
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:10,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">little particle on the core and and you</font>

361
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,579
get significant loss so another example

362
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,339
of that we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

363
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,080
microscopic world if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will and so</font>

364
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's hard to kind of identify with that</font>

365
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:24,190
so one example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I oftentimes give</font>

366
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,989
with two people is is this analogy here

367
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,850
where I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> take two glasses you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

368
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,570
can do this at a at a bar or something

369
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and take take 1 glass and put a little</font>

370
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,950
pebble or something right on the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

371
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,719
it and then slam another slam the

372
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,160
glasses together and you look at the

373
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glass and you'll see</font>

374
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,500
there's all sorts of junk on the end of

375
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,750
it afterwards that it's the same concept

376
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,330
it's nothing it's it's just happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

377
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,950
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad at a more smaller level but it's</font>

378
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that can identify that people</font>

379
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,480
can identify with and it's something

380
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,450
that helps you understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact of</font>

381
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,270
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> those 2 3 4 5 micron particles are</font>

382
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:04,089
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to a larger scale one</font>

383
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,670
thing that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out this in</font>

384
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:07,930
with this example people often<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ansel's</font>

385
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,660
it becomes a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to</font>

386
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">them that often times when when people</font>

387
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,709
are inspecting fiber connectors they

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,149
oftentimes won't inspect until after

389
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,579

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh sure enough I've got I've got a</font>

393
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,310
dirty connector problem with that is

394
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:28,719
that's that's too<font color="#E5E5E5"> little too late you</font>

395
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,920
already mated those connectors together

396
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,899
and

397
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,479
you've most likely embedded a lot of

398
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,880
that those particles inside of the glass

399
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,760
which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create pits and even</font>

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,829
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made able to remove them</font>

401
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,540
now you got chips that are in the way

402
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:45,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's permanent permanent damage to</font>

403
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,959
your connectors and also you're causing

404
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:50,729
back reflection that's sending it back

405
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,569
to hear your sources so just

406
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,670
understanding it from a data center

408
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:03,010
associated with this you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

409

if you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> one connector that has</font>

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,860
let's say that that thing was branching

415
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,600
off to four or five locations you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

429
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,350
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it proactively</font>

430
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:55,689
the problem this is it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know dirt is</font>

431
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,300
everywhere it's it's on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands it's</font>

432
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:01,839
in the air especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you go out to</font>

433
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">to outside plant locations it's you're</font>

434
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,299
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all sorts of it can</font>

435
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:10,030
exposure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dust and debris everywhere</font>

436
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,889
but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we just</font>

437
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to it's there we have to deal with</font>

438
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,000
it we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to remove</font>

439
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:18,669
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our data center all the dust</font>

440
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,520
particles that are you know 25 microns

441
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:23,589
are smaller and even though that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

442
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,049
our that's our biggest enemy in enough

443
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,668
with fiber connectors and even the brand

444
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,870
new connector can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be contaminated a lot</font>

445
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,429
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say well I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put a death</font>

446
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,439
you know the manufacturer builds these

447
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:34,090
things they they ensure its clean then

448
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,030
they put a desk cap on it and they ship

449
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,100
it over to me even that the dust cap can

450
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,470
be a source of contamination even more

451
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,850
so the dust cap can actually develop

452
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,070
condensation in it I

453
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,709
recently was meeting with some

454
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,750
contractors on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> East Coast and they</font>

455
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,970
had a whole slew of these pre polished

456
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,559
fiber optic connectors that they don't

457
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that means that they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

458
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">to terminate them I mean they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

459
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,230
to polish the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end faces and things</font>

460
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,669
and the mentality is is that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

461
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,440
when you have to manually polish the in

462
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">faces part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the practices to inspect</font>

463
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,260
it and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

464
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,580
chips or anything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

465
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,929
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of built into their installation</font>

466
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,820
procedure but these connectors that they

467
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:11,260
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using we're pretty polished so that</font>

468
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,909
they figured why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to look at</font>

469
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,730
the infant<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the factory sent it to me</font>

470
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,289
and after assume it's good and so I

471
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,280
looked at every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them every</font>

472
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:20,740
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them actually had</font>

473
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,059
developed a mold compound inside of

474
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,520
there just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the oils and the</font>

475
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,710
condensation just inside the desk<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple</font>

476
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,179
alone unfortunately that can be easily

477
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,740
removed you inspect that you look at

478
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and cleaning processes will take</font>

479
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,730
that right off because you haven't

480
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,679
embedded it in yet so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of quick</font>

481
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,360
zooming in and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't see</font>

482
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,460
that by even looking really close at

483
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,889
that but zooming in when you actually

484
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,919
get my<font color="#CCCCCC"> ab use a microscope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I circled a</font>

485
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,690
few particles here that are 2 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually using the microscope another</font>

488
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:55,600
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in mind is with with dirt</font>

489
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,610
is that i mentioned dust caps and things

490
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,110
like that people people can be the

491
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">source of those with your fingertips</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

492
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,320
just daily handling another big problem

493
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people often have is their own</font>

494
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">tests leads in in their test equipment</font>

495
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:09,880
you've got Joe Joe technician who always

496
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:12,330
carries<font color="#CCCCCC"> his he's got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test lead</font>

497
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,039
that he carries in his bag with them

498
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,889
however if that one can becomes

499
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,049
contaminated you run the risk of every

<font color="#E5E5E5">single connector that you plug that that</font>

501
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:25,000

507
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,659
happen they've been very costly mistakes

508
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,209
by a by folks in the service provider

509
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:41,500
side that have kind of taught us ahead

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">of time so that you guys don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

511
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,880
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fortunately the solution</font>

512
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:50,440
with this is fairly simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I joke that</font>

513
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:53,860
this is the world's most simple process

514
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,929
flow diagram and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fortunately it</font>

515
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,639
should be that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you inspect the fiber</font>

516
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,210
and yeah

517
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,690
that question is it clean yes or no if

518
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,950
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you clean it but here's that</font>

519
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,780
here's the here's the step that most

520
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,040
people miss after you clean it Yuri

521
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,170
inspects it again how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

522
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,300
clean a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people's</font>

523
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,130
cleaning process could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know</font>

524
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,570
rubbing the connector on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> shirt</font>

525
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,580
technically that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could qualify as</font>

526
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,870
cleaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might want to just check</font>

527
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,280
that make sure that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works there's</font>

528
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,540
other methods that you should look into

529
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that probably little bit more effective</font>

530
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,149
is it clean yes all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you're</font>

531
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,680
good to go you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect that and this</font>

532
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:35,160
is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy best practice to have I</font>

533
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,840
kind of put using a using a showings of

534
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,060
the tools of what this looks like same

535
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,889
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing inspect here's an example</font>

536
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,530
of a probe microscope inspecting the

537
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:46,260
connector located behind the bulkhead if

538
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,639
that's dirty you clean it it shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

539
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">little tool that's being used to clean</font>

540
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,720
it reinspect it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're good</font>

541
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,730
to go now you can connect it now a

542
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,070
couple things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be keep in mind it with</font>

543
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,290
fiber inspection associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

544
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,210
with that practice make sure you inspect

545
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,920
both sides of the connector that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

546
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,390
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest oversight</font>

547
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,430
you asked a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks who I inspect</font>

548
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,750
my connectors sure you have every patch

549
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,640
cord I have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always check it and make</font>

550
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,280
sure it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> before i plug</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in let's</font>

551
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's only half the connection in more</font>

552
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,230
than half the time the problem is

553
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:18,180
actually on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other end so without</font>

554
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,010
without inspecting both sides you

555
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:23,820
actually you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are kind of</font>

556
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:25,530
wasting your time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using a</font>

557
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,879
microscope that like a probe microscope

558
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has various tips and things you</font>

559
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,960
just change the tip out one side is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

560
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,460
a patch cord then you switch that tip

561
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,050
over and allows you to inspect inside

562
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,280
the bulkhead you can see here there's a

563
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,260
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> video display that you can hold</font>

564
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your hand that allows you to look at</font>

565
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,950
that look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end faces really easily</font>

566
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,300
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another big one at proactive make</font>

567
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,840
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're inspecting proactively</font>

568
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,730
I touched on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a little bit earlier</font>

569
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,649
you know here here's an example of you

570
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">inspect a connector you see a little bit</font>

571
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,550
of dirt on it so you clean it and it

572
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,960
looks fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you're able to connect</font>

573
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,370
contrast that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with reactive inspection</font>

574
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is that one where you saw some loss</font>

575
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,959
on a connector<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so then you go to</font>

576
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,940
inspect it I've

577
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're before not being able to remove</font>

578
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff once it's once it's embedded</font>

579
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,789
here's an example of I took a connector

580
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:16,678
I inspected it and it showed some

581
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:18,809
contamination on it and then what I did

582
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,870
was before cleaning I actually made it

583
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:24,059
it and then I cleaned it and irie

584
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,709
inspected it and you can see here

585
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,570
there's a lot of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> little black dots</font>

586
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,909
and stuff those actually got embedded

587
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,059
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fiber itself so they couldn't</font>

588
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:34,049
be removed so a simple best practice of

589
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,149
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is</font>

590
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,710
proactively this is this is a huge

591
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:39,299
mistake that people make just because

592
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,950
it's the mentality of thinking of

593
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:44,100
inspection as a troubleshooting tool as

594
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,279
opposed to a best practice like whenever

595
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,559
I I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just recently my wife had a baby</font>

596
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,140
we were in the hospital and everywhere I

597
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:55,379
looked in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room were little signs by</font>

598
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,730
the sink or wherever that said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

599
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you do anything wash your hands</font>

600
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">wash your hands and this is there's</font>

601
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,890
germs all over in the world I thought

602
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,500
that's that's actually it's kind of the

603
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">same concept here we've got it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

604
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,880
head that whenever we cook food whenever

605
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,990
we do anything we watch our hands it's

606
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,700
the same thing whenever you're handling

607
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,840
fiber you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you</font>

608
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,250

609
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">double-check that to me you actually</font>

610
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:19,230
have the ability to see if the germs are

611
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:21,299
there or not to extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that analogy and</font>

612
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,649
again some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those benefits that you're</font>

613
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,779
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this or reducing</font>

614
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:26,489
your network downtime reducing

615
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,529
troubleshooting optimizing your Sigma

616
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,770
performance and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> preventing</font>

617
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:35,159
costly network damage from occurring and

618
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:38,070
so it's a it's a really simple habit

619
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,590
that you can make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really yields a</font>

620
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:44,360
big benefit now I like in this example

621
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:46,439
to exercise or something that we all

622
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,760
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to exercise better</font>

623
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,659
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be going to the gym this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

624
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,309
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we all nod her head and</font>

625
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">say yes I should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be I should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

626
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:54,928
exercising three four times a week<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

627
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,820
we also make excuses why we don't do it

628
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:59,460
either oh it doesn't fit into my

629
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,490
schedule or whatever it may be I'm too

630
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,630
busy it's the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something</font>

631
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,640
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can all nod</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our heads but</font>

632
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,200
yeah I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be inspecting fiber</font>

633
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,210
that's that's that's what you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

634
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">but then when it actually comes time</font>

635
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're you've got here you're in a</font>

636
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,960
crunch situation you feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

637
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:19,080
to cut corners oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

638
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,020
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fortunately this is why I'd</font>

639
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,179
say

640
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,350
make sure when you're picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools that</font>

641
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:28,240
do that that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you inspect</font>

642
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,949
choose the right tools that actually our

643
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,690
bills intelligently rather than maybe

644
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,100
even using a simple microscope there's

645
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,500
some products<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually on the market now</font>

646
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,300
that will actually combine inspection

647
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,600
with other tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you use like</font>

648
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,180
everyone has a power meter for example

649
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,280
there's this is an example of a the

650
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,290
products that has a power meter with the

651
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,000
inspection portion built right in<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font>

652
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,379
folds in your regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> workflow you're</font>

653
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,050
already you're already taking a power

654
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,700
measurement and your inspection

655
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,050
microscope is right there so you don't

656
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to deal with setting down other</font>

657

tools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other kinds of a it folds in</font>

658
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,990
your workflow better in particularly as

659
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,240
network managers we like this because

660
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,310
you know that you can give this tool to

661
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,840
your technician and if everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

right in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of him and here this one</font>

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually in a little hands-free</font>

664
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,389
device that hangs around your neck

they're more likely to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if it's if</font>

666
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,970
it's right for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's design was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

667
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:20,530
work flow in mind so where does

668
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,810
inspection occur this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

669
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,060
basically just saying every stage that

670
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,649
fibers handle could start everywhere

671
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,120
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> component manufacturers all the</font>

672
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,460
way through to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the troubleshooting and</font>

673
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,899
maintenance side of things and this is

674
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,360
this is slowly working its way through

675
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,760
right now where we're inspecting every

676
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,409
single one of these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> boxes this</font>

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,930
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is happening now people are paying</font>

687
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,820
connectors really you have to have a

688
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,830
microscope in order to do it you can't

689
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,810
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your naked eye to do to look at that</font>

690
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,340
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get you very far and a</font>

691
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,200
probe microscope I'd recommend that's

692
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,939
that's probably the best way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go it's</font>

693
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,420
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really effective tool allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,770
see both sides you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see it on</font>

695
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,030
the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can show it to other</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not everyone can say yep</font>

697
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,800
that's a problem let's deal with that

698
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,149
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> proactive inspection</font>

699
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,010
fortunately is easy and there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to use is inspect before</font>
