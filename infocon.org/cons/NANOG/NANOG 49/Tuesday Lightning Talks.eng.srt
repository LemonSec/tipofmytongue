1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,670
well welcome everyone back to the

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,070
general session one reminder here is to

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,320
submit lightning for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday the</font>

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,080
voting I believe begins at six pm and

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,670
the notifications will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> by 630pm so</font>

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,750
you definitely want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know get</font>

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,920
those in now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,179
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,990
something about the vendor collaboration

11
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:37,180
room in a little bit and just I think

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reminder here for the social</font>

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,920
tonight at the clift hotel at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8pm and</font>

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,830
which will be hosted by course I and

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,750
hurricane electric and we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,790
begin with the lightning talks here up

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:58,090
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be Carlos Vicente with the</font>

18
00:00:48,790 --> 00:01:00,220
University of Oregon hello so i'll be

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:04,059
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this open source tool that</font>

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:07,179
we've been developing and using for a

21
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:12,030
while and the hope is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's useful</font>

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:15,190
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what does it do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,710
basically there are several things

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:23,380
discovers devices and their topology

25
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:26,860
using SNMP it's also a ipam software so

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:31,780
it organizes your IP address space ipv4

27
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:34,840
and ipv6 it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be used to document</font>

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:40,510
your cable plant so all your fiber and

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:42,130
copper assets we use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to organize all</font>

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,200
the contact information that we deal

31
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,259
with and it also generates

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,100
configurations for other tools and has

33
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,260
role-based access control so why do we

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,390
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> this project we really wanted to</font>

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:00,060
centralize and integrate network

36
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,060
information this has the

37
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,548
the characteristic that it reduces

38
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,818
manual process it says as everybody

39
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,890
knows manual manually added information

40
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,420
becomes outdated really quickly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

41
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,510
idea was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce that as much as</font>

42
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible also we wanted to generate</font>

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,670
reports more easily and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> things were</font>

44
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,040
scattered everywhere in different in

45
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:25,829
several text files and different

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,700
databases it was really hard but this

47
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:32,040
this facilitates<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reporting we also</font>

48
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,089
wanted to delegate tasks to departments

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,130
so they could deal with their own

50
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:41,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">information and there were no similar</font>

51
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,319
open source projects other tools were

52
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,090
doing one thing very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

53
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,790
device management very well or they did

54
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:53,459
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> palm very well or asset fiber assets</font>

55
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:57,540
but no tools that I knew of we're doing

56
00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:00,209
it all together so in our operation

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">nettle has become the source of truth so</font>

58
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:06,810
we go to nettle to find out how things

59
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be and we use it as I said to</font>

60
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,760
generate configurations for different

61
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">things so we generate our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS own files</font>

62
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,380
or dhcp configurations we keep our

63
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,780
nagios updated 6mon also and we populate

64
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,069
the cacti database from from this which

65
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,260
is really useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course rancid</font>

66
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:33,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">weight every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time we add a router or a</font>

67
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:36,298
switch it gets into rancid automatically

68
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,850
so about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device documentation part a</font>

69
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,400
lot of information interfaces and IP

70
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,319
addresses subnets<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans modules we</font>

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,920
collect our tables and pouring tables

72
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,980
and spanning tree information of course

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,679
manufacturer model version of the OS or

74
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,649
femur firmware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're familiar</font>

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,430
with net disco another very good project

76
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,790
we borrowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> there SNMP info libraries</font>

77
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:07,280
they do a great job of finding the right

78
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:14,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">OID in the mips for each individual</font>

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:16,380
vendor so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm also the layer 2 topology</font>

80
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:21,750
discovery a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unique in its own</font>

81
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:24,030
way we collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and analyze different</font>

82
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,820
sources of information CDP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> n LBP</font>

83
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,710
spanning tree state and forwarding table

84
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,360
data we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those sources and we</font>

85
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,479
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a good guess of how things</font>

86
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">are connected and it works really well</font>

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,610
of course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can add more information to</font>

88
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,100
to each device manually so where it's

89
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,230
located who the contacts are how we want

90
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,760
it monitored how the ports are assigned

91
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:55,050
to Jack's etc this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example of a</font>

92
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:57,750
report where we see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices and when</font>

93
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,890
we show the manufacturer model OS

94
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,419
version and how many devices of each

95
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,880
model we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a certain version so</font>

96
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:10,320
we it's easy to know what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

97
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,540
update the topology graphing also very

98
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,130
useful you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take one note and say I</font>

99
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to see all the neighbors of this</font>

100
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,409
node and how many hops away you want to

101
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,560
graph so we can say 1 level 2 level 3

102
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:27,870
levels or infinite which<font color="#CCCCCC"> wraps the whole</font>

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,030
network another very useful part of it

104
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,070
is you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> visualize your spanning tree</font>

105
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,260
state so you can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

106
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,900
is the one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be that</font>

107
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the priorities are set correctly etc</font>

108
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,929
what interfaces are participating in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

109
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:46,080
tree then moving on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP address</font>

110
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">management part it organizes as I said</font>

111
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,240
before in v6 outer space hierarchically

112
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,750
and it uses a try algorithm so each time

113
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:59,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">you add something it it updates the</font>

114
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:01,890
hierarchy pretty quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and since we</font>

115
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,520
have device management it we take

116
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage of device discovery to insert</font>

117
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,039
a new subnets when we discover layer 3

118
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,560
devices it it also shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphical</font>

119
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">representation of IP blocks I generates</font>

120
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,630
DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> on files and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these to be</font>

121
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,810
configurations right now for ice is see

122
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:24,120
buying and the HPD

123
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:29,400
we use it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> track IP and mac addresses</font>

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:32,310
over time another very useful thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

125
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,710
it generates a and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Quadi records</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

126
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,050
router interfaces so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

127
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,870
maintain that manually you bring up a

128
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,210
new interface discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router and it</font>

129
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,419
generates the a records for for that

130
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,090
interface and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course we can delegate</font>

131
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:49,139
the management of outer space to

132
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,989
departments that want to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their</font>

133
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:56,639
own records so it takes a lot of work

134
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:59,490
off of our daily routine this is an

135
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of our ipv4 block view this is a</font>

136
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:05,400
/ 16 and shows all the subdivisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

137
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">the allocations you can see in a green</font>

138
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,070
space is space that we can allocate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

139
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,169
yellow space is it means that there's

140
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,550
subdivisions within that so that's a

141
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:19,080
container and we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it almost daily to</font>

142
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,220
find address space that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

143
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,740
allocate really useful looking at a

144
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,300
subnet if you click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those</font>

145
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:31,530
allocated blocks and and it happens to

287
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,069
AAS and eventually making it back out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

288
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,040
China too in this case ten thousand

289
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,200
twenty six pack net and then on to their

290
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,599
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and peers and the networks</font>

291
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:20,400
that they serve and so by crossing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

292
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,970
Chinese networks these DNS queries were

293
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,410
actually getting subject to this

294
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:30,600
tampering behavior that has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> studied</font>

295
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,280
but to actually have this happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

296
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,570
a lot of bad thing you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

297
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,060
unlucky so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of conditions</font>

298
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,580
to be met you need to query a block

299
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,280
domain you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it not cash by</font>

300
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,020
you or your ganna server you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

301
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,890
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm also not can</font>

302
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,660
and it's got a 48-hour TTL when you go

303
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,880
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a query a root server you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

304
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right one you need to go to I root</font>

305
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,400
and need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a be in that footprint</font>

306
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,459
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route leak to get China's the</font>

307
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:03,209
Beijing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> root instance had you met all</font>

308
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:06,950
of those criteria then your query to a

309
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,900
block domain would not return a calm or

310
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:13,500
whatever server you would get a bogus

311
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:17,340
response back and in it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what was</font>

312
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:20,610
observed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in March those responses had a</font>

313
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:26,840
24-hour TTL so for 24 hours you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

314
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:31,530
poison cash so with this this plot here

315
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:34,830
illustrates is the two prefixes that I

316
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,959
we've seen globally the / 23 and / 24 we

317
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,740
never saw this behavior for this last 23

318
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,850
but we did see this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the / 24 where</font>

319
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know beginning in january and</font>

320
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:50,070
creeping up into late<font color="#E5E5E5"> March we saw more</font>

321
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:53,760
and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our peers seeing this route</font>

322
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:57,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Asia and until the email had come out</font>

323
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,170
it also went out onto the the nanog list

324
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:04,830
and the following day that that route

325
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:07,920
was withdrawn and really hadn't had been

326
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:10,349
gone for a couple of months and we were

327
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,750
actually preparing a talk for this man

328
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:13,949
odd last<font color="#E5E5E5"> week and just recompiling the</font>

329
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,630
day to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we have it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

330
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we noticed this thing had come back</font>

331
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:23,190
last week which is hence the timeliness

332
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:28,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this talk so as of as of today</font>

333
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:31,350
now this this week does continue and an

334
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:34,470
answer seemed legitimate now for for

335
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,530
those users that are seeing the router

336
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,450
question yeah yeah I'm do admire but

337
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:43,200
this is a Kirko question from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Curtis</font>

338
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">linquist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay he's asking um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

339
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,100
actually seeing incorrect<font color="#CCCCCC"> response to</font>

340
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">self size</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of China no and</font>

341
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,250
actually I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the in the</font>

342
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,659
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a great great</font>

343
00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:02,310
clarification I think yeah well that's

344
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,990
later in the presentation so so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

345
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">what this type of behavior looks like</font>

346
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,970
this as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS tampering just</font>

347
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,230
recently this is a client<font color="#CCCCCC"> in China we're</font>

348
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:15,540
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to query a block domain the</font>

349
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:18,090
domain we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook throughout this</font>

350
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,740
presentation as an example you could use

351
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,290
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these there's tens of thousands</font>

352
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:26,040
of lock domains things that aren't

353
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,659
blocked are getting through so don't get

354
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,300
too caught up on the use of Facebook

355
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,540
it's not just facebook but here's an

356
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:40,680
example where you're getting a random IP

357
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:42,120
address as a response and and this is

358
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,340
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the play by play at a TCP dump</font>

359
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,280
of what this transaction looks like so

360
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:50,310
in the first block you see a query going

361
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,200
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i route the second one is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

362
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:58,379
answer coming back four milliseconds

363
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:00,360
back with a bad answer another response

364
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">come bet another bad response comes back</font>

365
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,139
just for good measure because you didn't

366
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,120
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first bad one and then the</font>

367
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,770
client tries to take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one tries</font>

368
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with it I guess the second one</font>

369
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,700
doesn't expect this it sends back an

370
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,889
unreachable and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is expected</font>

371
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,010
behavior this is something that's been

372
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:20,640
well documented in on Chinese networks

373
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:23,640
and this client this is a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside</font>

374
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,830
of China and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the same</font>

375
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,440
behavior for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes or just about</font>

376
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:32,850
any DNS query so it's isn't specific to

377
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:36,000
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> root server Sarah question more common</font>

378
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,070
that's the multiple answers is usually a

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,850
fingerprint of packet injection where

380
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:45,570
you have multiple injectors running

381
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:49,620
often if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the ipid and other</font>

382
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:51,659
things ipid and random IP flags may

383
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,340
often be able to fingerprint the

384
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,340
injectors themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

385
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:05,330
so now we tried to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. client</font>

386
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:08,210
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCCW transit that was seeing this</font>

387
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,978
this the route in question and see if it

388
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,330
would get good results so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to</font>

389
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:12,469
confirm that we were crossing the path

390
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,468
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were crossing we</font>

391
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:18,109
performed traceroute got to get an IP

392
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:21,200
address from 24 151 which is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:22,609

394
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,929
result so that's a different behavior

395
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:32,119
than it was observed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in March but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

396
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:35,089
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese client we looked at</font>

397
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:40,519
earlier also starred to get a good

398
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:43,580
result when wearing a bad domain block

399
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,789
domain and but then 45 minutes later

400
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting a bad result again so there was</font>

401
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:55,339
some non determinism as far as when this

402
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:58,359
occurred for a client in China so to

403

Renesys did exchange a couple of emails

427
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / did post his response to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the DNS operations and I believe as well</font>

429
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,730
as in that man dog list saying that he

mistake that occurred in March but<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

432
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,169
been assured that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wouldn't happen</font>

433
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">again and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I some questions remind in our</font>

434
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,790
mind as far as what was that mistake

435
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:36,890
that happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what was the what was</font>

436
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the remediation and then also what's</font>

437
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:43,850
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen going forward for this</font>

438
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:46,700
for this type of this route so quickly

439
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,800
our recommendations here are we think

440
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,990
the root server operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> would keep a</font>

441
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,970
close eye on the routes people using<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

442
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,950
reach their instances especially i'll

443
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:58,850
call them in the challenging networking

444
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:00,890
environments and it's it's great to

445
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,770
operate a domestic local instance of a

447
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,879
that's probably best practice to keep

448
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:11,810
that to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> kiva as a local domestic</font>

449
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,780
service and and we as a community ought

450
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,570
to take take some responsibility and we

451
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:22,730
identify a leak like this to do what we

452
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:28,330
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to try to plug that leak thanks</font>

valid discussion to have I think I

471
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,680
there's been some discussion about you

472
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:19,250
know if you did put a hotels and other

473
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:22,220
companies do filtering on DNS blocking

474
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:28,130
and you know the question is do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

475
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:37,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a root server there so thanks oh</font>

477
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:44,260
this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> parse for me I have no</font>

478
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,730
insight as to why or how it happened but

479
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,820
it won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible for it to happen</font>

do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fibers</font>

489
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:53,520
hi so this talk is sound about using<font color="#CCCCCC"> vgb</font>

490
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,040
communities this is the most common tool

491
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,550
which most of you are extremely familiar

492
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:02,760
with the URL here in fact includes all

493
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:05,370
the latest material the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

494
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,370
talk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I met two weeks ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer</font>

495
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,649
live customer who had assigned who got

496
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:14,550
assigned the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for octet AAS number and</font>

497
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:19,830
with today<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp encoding he is not able</font>

498
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:22,020
to inject any<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp communities in most</font>

499
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,820
implementations at least of bgp so

500
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,520
clearly there is a practical needs to be

501
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:29,730
solved so first<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

502
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:33,180
current<font color="#CCCCCC"> vgp communities then i go into</font>

503
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:35,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the proposing new encoding and if we</font>

504
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,430
proposing new encoding we have a unique

505
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,980
chance to actually get together and

506
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,570
define whole bunch of new<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-known</font>

507
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,050
communities well-known<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

508
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:48,149
oxymoron here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known predefined</font>

509
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,430
communities to be used in operational

510
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,800
life because currently each of the

511
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:55,170
providers maintains the web page of its

512
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,080
own communities and if you want to have

513
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:02,130
any action than you have to negotiate by

514
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,620
telephone by email that can change so

515
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently the RFC for bgp communities</font>

516
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple it has been done about</font>

517
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,690
13 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it defines</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two octet</font>

518
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,810
for a s number and two opted for the

519
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:18,300
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alias number it is said</font>

520
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,730
specifically in the RFC indicates the

521
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,899
source of the community that's also

522
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:26,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">something which I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to address</font>

523
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:30,120
so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to encode for</font>

524
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">octavius number in this encoding and the</font>

525
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,719
well-known ranges don't even allow when

526
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,880
code neah number so essentially what I'm

527
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,730
proposing is to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the regular type of</font>

528
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,100
external community basically defined a

529
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:47,100
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> type value both for transit depend</font>

530
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,709
on transitive cases and have seven

531
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,110
updates left to play with because

532
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,590
external communities are eight octants

533
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,590
in total

534
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,729
additional octet i use for actions and

535
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you on the slide what the</font>

536
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:05,190
actions actually mean what is also most

537
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,780
important in this new encoding<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

538
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,970
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use single encouraging for both</font>

539
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,670
to update and for our today s numbers so

540
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:16,440
we limit number of problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

541
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:18,960
minimum another thing it can include<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

542
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,420
number as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameter of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

543
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,730
so today<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have no way of actually</font>

544
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,400
indicating in the community that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

545
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,710
action has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done only if given AS</font>

546
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,490
matches and i'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you two some</font>

547
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:35,160
simple examples or do i mean by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

548
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:37,500
actions in fact the additional octet

549
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:42,360
allows me to define a couple of new

550
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,490
behaviors in fact 256 or 255 I'd only

551
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,310
define to hear one is informational

552
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,530
support so if I'm in a s which supports

553
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,540
different set of communities and those

554
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,460
communities can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> executed by it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

555
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,440
injected by someone remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

556
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,440
indicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm supporting that no</font>

557
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,290
action on the router is necessary and

558
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,500
another action is mandatory means that

559
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:07,110
if I'm supporting given community I

560
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,090
better executed or drop the update<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

561
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,250
some extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> this behavior may be useful</font>

562
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,110
in some networks it is not to say that

563
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,090
I'm making commute is mandatory no

564
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,790
communities are still on the best effort

565
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:20,610
basis some vendors can support some

566
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:23,399
communities some may not if and this

567
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't change so the new encoding</font>

568
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,830
actually allows you to specify 42,000 of

569

your own communities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm reserving</font>

570
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:35,129
about 20,000 for predefined ones to

571
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,169
maintain in database so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

572
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,970
opportunity to give huge credit to all

doing event or all of those if you want

<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk to the genius you go to the</font>

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">i basically just grabbed from the web</font>

exactly external moment for you all to

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,359
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a feedback because i hold on</font>

publishing the draft before I get more

585
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,129
feedback I road ahead get some good

586
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:15,570
feedback from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of operators but I</font>

587
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:19,109
need more I mean the more we have the

588
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:22,468
better the outcome can be so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far i</font>

589
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:24,239
define the black hole with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source is</font>

590
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:26,989
so basically i defined that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I owned the</font>

591
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:29,339
black hole only the source is matches

00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:31,229
source black hole basically on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

593
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:36,059
direction from the customer to the

network source RPF and higher priority

595
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:42,119
prefix another set of communities

596
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:44,698
control the advertisement for example I

597
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:48,389
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify as a parameter in the</font>

00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:57,749
or I want to specify to which is I want

601
00:30:54,419 --> 00:31:00,089
to advertise given prefix so those are

602
00:30:57,749 --> 00:31:03,299
options which are all not possible today

603
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:06,049
by using normal communities because

604

those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a specific communities</font>

606
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,589
you will see from your operational life

607
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:15,928
that you often mark routes as coming

608

from peers from customers internal and

609

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something which can be easily defined</font>

here in the in the community space and

655
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,649
use as the radius for update propagation

668
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,149
in layer it one of the problems that I

669
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:24,419
have with pre defining all these type of

670
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:26,790
options is where they're applicable is

671
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:29,520
very specific to policy so for example

672
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:32,159
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may not want your peers being able</font>

673
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,730
to say no export to this asn or that asn

674
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,350
you may want

675
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,940
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers you may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even want</font>

676
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,918
your customers to be able to say no

677
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,720
export in this region because that may

678
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,489
violate your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Piron requirements to</font>

679
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,189
announce consistently there's so many

680
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:47,069
things that are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so specific even</font>

00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,750
location coding adjusting local<font color="#E5E5E5"> prep</font>

682
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,119
you're talking about adjusting local

<font color="#CCCCCC">press by 20 30 40 50 some people have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that are just impossible to standardize</font>

687
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:05,580
like I really I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see more support</font>

00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,490
for for being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use the extended</font>

689
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,259
communities to be able to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like</font>

690
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:12,180
specify actions that to use that extra

691
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,420
type information to say apply this

692
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:20,250
action to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASM versus use this this</font>

693
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,630
only as informational but I it kind of

694
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,960
gets weird when you start talking about

695
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:27,180
pre defining all these action types well

696
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,550
so the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment I would say I just</font>

697
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">collected the most commonly used once of</font>

00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,960
course as you are correct that each is

699
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,210
it's very topologist specific may have

700
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,250
whole bunch of new defying definitions

701
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,350
to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is still there so if</font>

you're showing examples it's another

705
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,290
thing if your pre defining these and

706
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,180
expecting these to ever be implemented

707
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,430
it kind of like that the the no peer

708
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,350
community how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here support</font>

709
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,390
that and they're in their configuration

710
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,450
today probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody because no one</font>

711

00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:01,200
used well so he actually the feedback if

it's negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> field like if I should</font>

714
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,210
remove something it's also good but if

00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,280
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes use of that I would</font>

716
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,830
rather leave it and it's annoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

738
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,640
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that it's somewhat</font>

739
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,260
dangerous to standardize communities

740
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,299
that there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a broad spectrum of</font>

741
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,220
agreement on and they're relatively few

742
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,349
where there are four mostly the same

reasons that Richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> steenburgen has</font>

full of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who could actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that so like I wouldn't necessarily</font>

747
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,410
dissuade you from heading down this

748
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,759
route so much as i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

749
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:28,920
they're sort of like if there were a

750
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,380
community consensus that standardizing

751
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,369
certain communities was a good idea that

752
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,010
would be something that could be

753
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:36,720
documented and that's precisely what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

754
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,369
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically some some broader</font>

richard as well and you know these are

certainly you know topologically

769
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,000
those on ingress and not only because of

770
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,129
different people's interpretation of

771
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,080
those but also for things like the more

772
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,849
unique attributes you have the bigger

know of some of the systemic state and

00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,710
routing systems so just you know that's

mentioning the offset working group

poor resetting on in bounty indeed but

with current packing being 3.2 or 3.5<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

783
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,990
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a big difference but i</font>

784
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,640
think in general the feedback which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,399
looking for particular is it that is a

786
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,069
good and I a good idea to remotely

787
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,500
execute some actions that's something

788
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:54,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">which is not happening today and to some</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">only thing I would say that it is but</font>

795
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:07,920
it's bad idea to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a community</font>

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,359
is going to be transitive in a real in

the real internet right it's a really

798
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,519
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea to rely upon that because a lot</font>

808
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:44,400
similar to lead to us we use the no

export community today we're probably

810
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,180
one of very few people like them who try

811
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:52,259
to use this with tons of providers all

812
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,819
over the place and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> little rant with</font>

813
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:56,759
this that I've given<font color="#CCCCCC"> to many people is</font>

814
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:58,558
if you read the BGP rfcs it says if your

815
00:39:56,759 --> 00:40:01,410
implementation supports communities it

816
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:04,529
must know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about no export and no</font>

817
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:06,390
advertise and the software does you know

00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:09,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cisco juniper whoever got this right in</font>

819
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:12,450
their software the ISPs then go and

820
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:16,440
write a route map that says delete all

821
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:20,218
communities and so the must be supported

822
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,749
feature doesn't work you send him no

823
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:22,920
export and they happily drop it on the

824
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:25,259
floor cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never wanted to hear a</font>

825
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,930
community from you and if you go way

826
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:29,640
back in history there was almost a good

827
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:33,479
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this there was a time in your</font>

828
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,430
router software where deleting

829
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:38,609
everything but no export and no

830
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise was somewhere between painful</font>

831
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:43,078
and impossible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know five ten</font>

832
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,779
fifteen years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago it's been a while now</font>

833
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:48,809
all of said vendors fixed this you can

834
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:50,549
define<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of allow no export allow</font>

835
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:54,299
no advertise delete everything else and

836
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:57,479
say on my inbound do that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

837
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:59,219
reasons I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably I root and I</font>

838
00:40:57,479 --> 00:41:01,618
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> F route from time to time has had</font>

839
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:05,430
leaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we send no export and people</font>

840
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:07,529
ignore it and so I have a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

841
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:10,029
couple apart plea there one is if you're

842
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:12,400
an operator your software now does this

843
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,780
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> think really hard i understand</font>

844
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,130
you probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take 50</font>

845
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,450
million communities from your peers and

846
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,060
that exchange points and all this other

847
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:21,240
stuff could we just get no export and no

848
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,230
advertise to actually work internet wide

849
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,750
because it would really help a lot of

850
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:28,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but that I think goes to the fear</font>

851
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,940
with this as a network operator I find

852
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,529
this frightening because my users are

853
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:37,090
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expect the well-known</font>

854
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:39,430
communities to work as a user I think

855
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:42,130

856
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:44,470
providers would implement a good part of

857

that list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

859
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:50,950
mind on this and whether it's a it's a

860
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,510
good idea a lot of Richard's concern

861
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,680
from the operator side about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the finding</font>

862
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,140
these because people are going to send

863
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and expect the behavior to happen</font>

864
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:00,490
and when it doesn't then you run into

865
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:03,100
things like I'm running into now with no

866
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:05,649
export yes excellent excellent feedback

867
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:08,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">all I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to add to this is that</font>

870
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,790
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define is community templates</font>

871
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,040
essentially which just define the format

872
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:21,040
of a given action and her as completely

873
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,350
as you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way to guarantee that</font>

874
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,330
something going to be applied or not on

earlier i had that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned was um</font>

878
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,920
he said sending no exports you mean

879
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,990
transit riders or peers who expect your

settlement repairs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept you did</font>

881
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:44,680
traffic engineer them by no advertising

882
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:48,610
no explore my expectation given the way

883
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,319
we work and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> my interpretation of</font>

884
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:54,100
how I think the software should work so

885
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:57,370
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very caveated is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

886
00:42:54,100 --> 00:43:00,610
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to send no export on any session</font>

887
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:04,779
anywhere and the other side must honor

888
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:06,940
it and I take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the RFC says</font>

889
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:11,230
if your software supports communities

890
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:12,670
you must support no export now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I realize</font>

891
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it doesn't say and then you also</font>

892
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write your policy to do that you</font>

893
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,840
know

894
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,339
there's a whole different thing there's

895
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,869
a difference between defining how code

896
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,970
works and defining how somebody

897
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:25,780
configures the routers and we can debate

898
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:28,149
that all afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it really seems</font>

899
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:30,310
to me in those cases it should be a must

900
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:32,020
and I mean I could debate on everything

901
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:34,330
in his list whether they should be musts

902
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:38,680
or nice to haves or maybe somebody

903
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:41,470
you'll do it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever but you know I</font>

904
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,230
to Richard's point a lot of the things

905
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:46,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are proposed can potentially have</font>

906
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,190
downstream consequences<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if I</font>

907
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,750
don't advertise to like three piers

908
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,150
maybe that violates some other agreement

909
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,800
or other things I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally when</font>

910
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:57,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you talk about a few core things like no</font>

911
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,080
export there's almost no pitfall there

912
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,368
I'm sure somebody somewhere will

913
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,310
probably find me after this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell me</font>

914
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:08,050
what the pitfall is but it really is you

915
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:12,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">know kind of pitfall free so yeah I</font>

916
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:14,619
think it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a must we just have</font>

917
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:17,380
after Joel right really quick

920
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,770
set of well-known communities the

question you would you ask your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not what communities do support it is do</font>

923
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:33,580
you support bcp foo community templates

924
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,710
yes and that's precisely the point of

925
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:40,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that list in fact I knew I'm opening the</font>
