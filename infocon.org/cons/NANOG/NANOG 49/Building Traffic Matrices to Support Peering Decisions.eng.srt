1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:13,550
up next we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Paolo loose enter from</font>

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">kpn we will talk about building traffic</font>

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:20,950
matrix traffic matrices for supporting

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,950
during decisions Paolo

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,450
so good afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Paolo</font>

6
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:19,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">shonta and among the other things I'm</font>

7
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,420
lead developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the VMS ECT software</font>

8
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:24,780
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to speak</font>

9
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about traffic matrixes and</font>

10
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,670
expression in the context of peering

11
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:38,229
agenda for today<font color="#CCCCCC"> a brief</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction a</font>

12
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,919
couple of slides about<font color="#CCCCCC"> PMS ECT and then</font>

13
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:43,959
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the details first of</font>

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,990
all why is speaking about traffic

15
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:50,649
matrixes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> rephrase it and trying to</font>

16
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,229
waste your time today my answer would be

17
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:57,729
not of course I'm here so what else you

18
00:01:53,229 --> 00:02:01,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to need to say and I think much</font>

19
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:03,908
traffic matrixes are very useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

20
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,069
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> network operator activities</font>

21
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:09,429
and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example capacity planning</font>

22
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:11,500
traffic engineering better understanding

23
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,299
traffic patterns and of course hearing

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:19,319
and this is where we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be focusing</font>

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:21,850
today still traffic matrixes are

26
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,358
important to a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of activities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

27
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:29,950
they keep behind the scenes topic like i

28
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:32,940
was browsing some archives and all i

29
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,040
could find is very few contributions and

30
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,519
most of them were formal contributions

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,828
and the others were saying about a

32
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,780
buddhist of traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> matrixes what you</font>

33
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:47,790
can do with traffic matrixes a lot of

34
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:52,480
things very nice but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like to say</font>

35
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,548
with this contribution like where you

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,078
can what are the challenges and try to

37
00:02:54,549 --> 00:03:02,410
answer the questions that you see over

38
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:05,049
here so with a very technical count so

39
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,299
back once again to square number one

40
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,660
building traffic matrix is preparing the

41
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:13,959
decisions what is needed what is our

42
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:17,850
shopping list it's a about bgp telemetry

43
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:20,960
data soil<font color="#E5E5E5"> net flow as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flour or similars</font>

44
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,180
a collector infrastructure system

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,720
storage and of course maintenance and

46
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,730
the post-processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> scripts while</font>

47
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,830
supporting some operators worldwide

48
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,440
building traffic matrixes what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

49
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,250
recognized is that the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge</font>

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a technical challenge its an</font>

51
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,930
organizational challenge and yeah the

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">800-pound gorilla project because you</font>

53
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,660
can already see that the shopping list

54
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:54,420
includes something very different things

55
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,810
and they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a larger organization</font>

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,730
they can span across departments so you

57
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,770
can already see multiple people involved

58
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,950
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> background</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be a project</font>

59
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">manager</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and things like that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

60
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,200
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing to take into</font>

61
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,790
account it's from an organizational

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,119
point of view maybe you have to gather

63
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:22,530
few heads together and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:25,230
easy speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so let's start from</font>

65
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,590
the tool what is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enabler to build</font>

66
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:33,750
a traffic matrix I'd say p.m. CT which

67
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:37,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source free software p necessity</font>

68
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:40,920
here very poor choice as a name it's an

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,659
ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 accounting package and with</font>

70
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nexus light it will become more</font>

71
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,920
apparent maybe why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a good</font>

72
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,650
enabler for the task but essentially in

73
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,470
this slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see on one side</font>

74
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,750
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic collection methods</font>

75
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,760
solely<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up net flow as flow and</font>

76
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,400
things like that on the other side you

77
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,099
have a common open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source relational</font>

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,830
databases but also memory tables emesis

79
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,700
it is me sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle it's not</font>

80
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,390
just writing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the backend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it gets</font>

81
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,820
from the network instead it also uses

82
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,210
offers some data reduction techniques

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,400
like a spatial and temporal aggregation

84
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,190
filtering and sampling or subsampling

85
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,890
and also tagging

86
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:34,770
Luke house one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those lookouts is of</font>

87
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:38,550
course bgp what happened last year in

88
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:42,799
2009 is that MC city was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just regular</font>

89
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:45,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">net flow as flow collector yeah just</font>

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,570
introducing things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing to</font>

91
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:51,900
database and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob I mean regular</font>

92
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:56,340
collector what happened is that it was

93
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,200
introduced<font color="#CCCCCC"> the BGP demon within the</font>

94
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,599
software has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a parallel tried to the</font>

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,750
collector so now you get to two parallel

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,660
threads one death telemetry data the

97
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:13,050
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> gas and handles the BGP sessions</font>

98
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,900
features of this bgp demon are it

99
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,690
behaves<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a passive bgp demon a bit</font>

100
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">passive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> busy being neighbors sorry and</font>

101
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,219
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also nice implication that we</font>

102
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,640
will see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide and the other</font>

103
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,680
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's a multi rate which</font>

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,080
should be demon implementation so the

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,300
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that because you want imagine you</font>

106
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,950
will have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> big network and imagine</font>

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you are appearing with the same</font>

108
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">people yeah various part of the world so</font>

109
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,930
you want to capture localized<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

110
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,169
information you don't want to work out

111
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,510
any global best spot or anything like

112
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to capture capture all the</font>

113
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:55,260
local information and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> look them</font>

114
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:59,280
up so why introducing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp demon in a</font>

115
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:02,159
net flores flow collector the idea the

116
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,030
vision if you want was that yeah

117
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,510
telemetry protocols should report on the

118
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,450
forwarding plane so should help the

119
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:15,180
accounting of data but telemetry should

120
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,820
not report on control plane information

121
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,070
they don't should not try to transfer

122
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,130
over and over the same information right

123
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,680
so that's that's what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen if</font>

124
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,960
you embed a lot of bgp information for

125
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,200
example in a net flow every micro flow

126
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,650
is attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same information it's</font>

127
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,630
a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more optimal that you get your</font>

128
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,640
collector

129
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,890
peirong will you be appearing with your

130
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,560
bruders so that you know the control

131
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:49,250
plane is there and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> done afterwards</font>

132
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just keep alive right so get</font>

133
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,570
approaching our shopping list that we

134
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,359
said before we said that one of the

135
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:59,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that we will need is getting vgp</font>

136
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the collector so the advice would be</font>

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,150
to get the collector<font color="#CCCCCC"> to BG ppl with all</font>

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,890
the P devices facing<font color="#CCCCCC"> fierce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transit and</font>

139
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:12,640
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> know best spot computation I</font>

140
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:17,510
mean that means that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all the</font>

141
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:22,159
BGP tables scalability is preferred to

142
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:25,580
memory usage and during the some

143
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,930
experiments I mean full bgp feed is

144
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:33,829
around 15 mags of memory that means that

145
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to yeah let the collector</font>

146
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:40,070

187
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:50,230
might require some more smart thinking

in this sense and which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah pop by</font>

192
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:08,680
is that in these cases you the beeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

199
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,160
you can jump from where it to the other

203
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,589

customers but ingress only measurements

206
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,990
I mean why is that because traffic

207
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,590
routed to destination so plenty of

208
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,250
information where traffic is going

209
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:00,170
and that's enough but instead it's

210
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,820
crucial to understand where traffic is

211
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,219
coming from especially if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,190
this sense if you do ingress measurement

215
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,950
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pease what you have is for sure</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that input interface but if the</font>

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,280
implementation of that protocol allows

219
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:27,349
for that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> also have the source</font>

carry a IP prefixes source and

233
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,780

234
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,450

245
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:48,680
mean I'm myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> a developer of telemetry</font>

246
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:50,390
collector and my personal opinion is

247
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,260
that there is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single collector</font>

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:57,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits all the bill and yeah and i</font>

249
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:01,460
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the toolbox in this sense can</font>

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,020
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> extended to a to some tools let's say</font>

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,210
in this sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean what I can see is</font>

253
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:12,770
that yeah you can export the telemetry

254
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:16,610
to old young collectors from your

255
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:20,900
Reuters you can involve multicast it's

always<font color="#E5E5E5"> elegant and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neat and nice and</font>

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,420
can perform<font color="#CCCCCC"> the export to some</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">running between them and then they will</font>

264
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,650
find out the data to the collectors and

265
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,990
in this sense I mean on one side there

266
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,209
is a things like flexible net flow which

267
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:54,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">are which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rapidly picking up which is</font>

269
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,210
wide deployed at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

270
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,240
crucial that collectors can discriminate

271
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,310
the traffic because what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen is</font>

272
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,740
that a trafficker that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending</font>

273
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,849
is not for all the collectors so very

274
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:15,680
important that for collector developers

275
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:18,890
and to capture with the yeah with a

276
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,689
workflow the telemetry data bgp

277
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,150
correlation we have a workflow in four

278
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,610
steps let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when everything is</font>

279
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,620
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the perspective of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Orange</font>

282
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:40,310
that all the PE routers send be cheap

food bgp tables to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> collector and the</font>

284
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,449
step number two would be that there is

285
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,180
some traffic flowing through and that

286
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:50,810
triggers step number three which is yes

287
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:54,680
sending the telemetry data to the

288

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> allometry data into the collector</font>

290
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see if there is a corresponding bgp</font>

291
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,500
table where yeah pgp data control plane

292
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,170
information can be look<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up against in</font>

293
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,670
the most simple scenario most basic

294
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,620
scenario this is though just by

295
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:16,099
comparing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source IP address of the</font>

296
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,730
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow agent and the source</font>

297
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,639
of the address

298
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:24,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp beer of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course i mean all sort</font>

299
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,310
of mapping is possible in this Suns

300
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:32,720
getting to the storing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of data I</font>

301
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:36,130
mean things it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be it is wise to</font>

302
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,649
agree to employee aggregation right and

303
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,570
aggregate both spatially<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a temper</font>

304
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:44,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the temporal dimension before</font>

305
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:48,649
writing things down so what I'm saying

306
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:50,329
is it's not always the optimal<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution</font>

307
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,610
if you are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security or</font>

308
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:55,790
forensics for example it's not wise to

309
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,529
log to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the disk every micro flow or</font>

310
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:01,339
every sample that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you received from the</font>

311
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:03,380
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I mean by aggregating you</font>

312
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:05,480
make an optimal usage of system

313
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,939
resources and you expect and when you

314
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">are building rapport you're avoiding</font>

315
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,770
expensive consolidation of the micro

316
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:15,140
information assumption and it is very

317
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,379
suitable for project driven deficits

318
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,470
what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by this is that I mean you</font>

319
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,040
build data set which are good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

320
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">project for a task or for a small set of</font>

321
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,149
tasks and then of course if you have

322
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">something different like you have to do</font>

323
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,809
billing still with net lower as flow and

324
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,360
things like that then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you build a</font>

325
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:38,540
different data set maybe also<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

326
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,729
different tool and that way yes you

327
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,620
waste a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more space because</font>

328
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:47,049
you're building several data sets but

329
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:53,689
then you have a very you know tighten up

330
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:56,299
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of system for all your needs open</font>

331
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,360
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> relational databases appearing</font>

332
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:02,030
natural choice for the task right they

333
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,449
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to handle very large data sets</font>

334
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:07,610
by themselves they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a flexible and</font>

335
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">standardized query language so mu need</font>

336
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the for a developer of a collector to</font>

337
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:16,309
reinvent the wheel and one very

338
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,590
important point is that yeah the offers

339
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:20,840
solid<font color="#CCCCCC"> and evolving storage and indexing</font>

340
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,918
engines so once again there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no need to</font>

341
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,020
invent the wheel once again<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah</font>

342
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,909
that is a debt all sorts to the

343
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,820
scalability because essentially if you

344
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,500
use relational

345
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,679
database you can always employ

346
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,790
clustering or partition once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again both</font>

347
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,490
in spatial and temporal dimensions just

348
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:46,290
to touch a little bit ground this is a

349
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:49,200
bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ass SQL schema don't take it</font>

350
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:54,389
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously I mean don't have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> art</font>

351
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,910
attack because of SQL at nanog but this

352
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,550
is just give you an idea right this is

353
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:02,190
how your data would look like once on

354
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the disk like a tag because it's always</font>

355
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,410
nice to target things bgp primitives

356
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,300
counters and the time reference and of

357
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:13,560
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is an example only because</font>

358
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can always freely mix and match bgp</font>

359
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:21,870
primitives with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer one layer 7</font>

360
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:24,630
remedies that's processing a few

361
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:29,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">examples like just to let you see how</font>

362
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:32,190
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to retrieve data out of out of</font>

363
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,230
a relational database and what you can

364
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,660
do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see very</font>

365
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,730
easily traffic deliberate to a pier per

366
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,830
location because you are appealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

367
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,660
the same people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in multiple locations or</font>

368
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,480
maybe you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see / location maybe</font>

369
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">not all opportunities are available and</font>

370
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,520
then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a nice example aggregator</font>

371
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,770
yes parts to the second hop imagine that

372
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are a CDN or you are a tier 2</font>

373
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,240
provider and you are buying IP transit

374
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,250
from somebody and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the first</font>

375
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,190
thing you want to do is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah your</font>

376
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,560
IP transit provider is never a friend it

377
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:10,440
carves money out of your pocket and they

378
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:13,470
are bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad guys so yeah so essentially</font>

379
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,390
yeah what you try to do is yet to

380
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,480
aggregator yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the second hole so</font>

381
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you try to see right the common</font>

382
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">denominator right after your IP transit</font>

383
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,760
provider who you can peer with and gets

384
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,940
the most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your destination of the</font>

385
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,860
traffic instead of trying with the

386
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">appealing with everybody which maybe</font>

387
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,939
it's not always an option and then it's

388
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,889
also very easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus yeah</font>

389
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,380
on peak our data for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

390
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,900
see for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last month every time what</font>

391
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,560
happens at 8pm right you can do that

392
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">very easy you can do every sort of top</font>

393
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,470
hang yes statistics for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

394
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,600
there is an example of grouping bgp

395
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,480
pairs of the same kind for example using

396
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the local preference to do that order</font>

397
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,040
three but traffic matrix<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a subset of</font>

398
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:09,690
it purpose being maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

399
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:12,090
inject data into a 30 party tool it's a

400
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:16,290
nice to play with the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> matrixes</font>

401
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:19,560
like in the last like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in the</font>

402
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:24,000
last couple of slides but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

403
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:26,010
nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to inject data into</font>

404
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,180
third party application so if you can

405
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:32,280
integrate the tool that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

406
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,760
produces you the traffic matrix so if

407
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,740
you can do that with the 30 party tools

408
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,070
you can have some very interesting

409
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,970
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can integrate</font>

410
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,950
that traffic matrix into traffic

411
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,940
planning and traffic engineering the

412
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:52,770
application like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carry than one and</font>

413
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,440
what happens is that besides playing

414
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:57,660
with the traffic matrix you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also</font>

415
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:01,850
play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the what-if scenarios which is</font>

416
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:06,720
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> harridan says</font>

417
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:10,639
about integration of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a net flow or as</font>

418
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,560
flow-based traffic matrix with the

419
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,270
traffic planning application it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

420
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,360
interesting what they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

421
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:21,120
essentially yeah interface statistics

422
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,389
are always the gold standard and that's

423
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,389
because it's what you base everything in

424
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,990
your network like traffic engineering

425
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:33,120
but also policies and things like that

426
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:36,600
on the other side I mean net flow or as

427
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,870
flow they are a very commonly sampled

428
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,669
and so they will never have

429
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:46,010
there will never be very precise there

430
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,110
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be always an error so what</font>

431
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:51,530
happens is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use interfaces</font>

432
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:54,800
statistics as scaling factor as a span

433
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:59,710
fancy scaling factor for your net flow

434
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:03,110
or as flow traffic matrix information I

435
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:06,200
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> topic but I</font>

436
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,240
felt to put a pointer to a previous non

437
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,180
presentation about this because you can

438
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,050
spend another half an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> just delving</font>

439
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:17,480
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic so essentially interface</font>

440
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,690
counters are the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliable source of</font>

441
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,240
information and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

442
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:26,150
collect net lower as flow as convenient

443
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:32,170
so it means that you can do a sort of

444
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:34,610
best effort try best effort to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk over</font>

445
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:37,490
yeah your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network with the traffic</font>

446
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:39,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">matrix so you can just have a subset of</font>

447
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pops or subset of the Reuters</font>

448
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,720
coverage or use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more spare sampling</font>

449
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,240
that's because you have still your

450
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,180
interface counters and then use a

451
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,220
regression method like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that we</font>

452
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,530
said before like the carrot angle demand

453
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,780
deduction or similar I mean there are

454
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:02,620
also other applications out there doing

455
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:06,710
the same last topic for today

456
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:09,979
scalability because I mean it's true

457
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:13,070
that yeah you can scale it up very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

458
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,280
because you don't do a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> fancy thing</font>

459
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,929
in within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the collector but still at</font>

460
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,560
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage you will hit a barrier that</font>

461
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be memory so you can store all EGP</font>

462
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:28,940
food routing tables into a single box or

463
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">CPU because you have so mad so yeah you</font>

464
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,470
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telemetry data</font>

465
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,649
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> davida et impera approach is very</font>

466
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:40,040
valid so you can assign he still

467
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:42,380
coupling telemetry and bgp never have to

468
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,240
decouple them so you can assign these

469
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,030
two collectors and in turn you can

470
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,929
assign collectors to databases or you

471
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,928
can clock

472
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:53,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database itself tricky scenario in</font>

473
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,730
this sense is when there are be<font color="#CCCCCC"> tipping</font>

474
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,320
except followers because of course

475
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,230
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you are splitting things</font>

476
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,269
among multiple boxes then it can end up

477
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> follow up the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

478
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:08,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the neck and the bitch beer above</font>

479
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,340
that neighbor is on another box so you

480
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:12,799
can either have or gateways or route

481
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">reflectors peel with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all collectors or</font>

482
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,860
put all the eggs in one basket or do

483
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:24,019
some bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> pierre mapping because that is</font>

484
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:26,959
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> some valid approach intuitively the</font>

485
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:29,149
matrix can become<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite big and of</font>

486
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,299
course some data reduction techniques

487
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:34,850
can be used at this for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose so</font>

488
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:38,330
you can keep smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reuters out of the</font>

489
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,860
equation but it orbs in specific pops

490
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,100
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the equation because they are</font>

491
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,689
negligible to the traffic matrix

492
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,189
essentially the whole purpose of the

493
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:51,139
tank is stripping out negligible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

494
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,320
is to read us in this to reduce

495
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:56,928
dispersion while still keeping a very

496
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,850
good overall picture so you can also

497
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:00,889
filter out the specific class of

498
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,158
customers maybe you are a very collapse

499
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:07,369
of network so you are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

500
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,990
everything out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> very big boxes and but</font>

501
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:11,269
for example you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal us throughout</font>

502
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,639
serial customer or things like that and

503
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,559
then you can also sleep down things

504
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,990
which are not essential to your specific

505
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:23,119
scenario for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are CDN you are</font>

506
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">very interested in yeah in upstream</font>

507
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,649
traffic but not very interested in to

508
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,629
downstream and the vice versa is true

509
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:33,110
for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP you want to know where</font>

510
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:34,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic is coming from and not really</font>

511
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,998
very interested where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sending</font>

512
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:42,340
traffic to maybe of course you can also

513
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:46,450
in yet do some more spares sampling or

514
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:49,820
yeah put thresholds on traffic relevance

515
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:52,100
and then let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not forget a project</font>

516
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,428
driven data set because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody can say</font>

517
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,199
a but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use the</font>

518
00:26:54,429 --> 00:27:00,039
approach so a traffic matrix<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

519
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,279
building security<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever well you are</font>

520
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that it won't scale at some stage</font>

521
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,389
yeah that is a wrong sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

522
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:10,480
consideration because if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

523
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:12,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you</font>

524
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,139
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregate the data different you</font>

525
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,559
would not use the traffic matrix in the

526
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:20,498
first place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to conclude my</font>

527
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:23,470
penultimate it slide it's just to give

528
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:26,590
some further yeah some pointers because

529
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:28,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially because just because of time</font>

530
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,658
constraints we can't approach all the

531
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:35,199
topics so there are so many topics yet

532
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:37,269
to be a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> like yeah yes Petraeus</font>

533
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,879
communities filter automatic routing

534
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,889
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important one but also</font>

535
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:44,259
entities on the provider IP address

536
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:46,899
space so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up a previous</font>

537
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:50,470
presentation down at the UK<font color="#CCCCCC"> off 14 and</font>

538
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:53,350
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have also other yet</font>

539
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,649
pointers for examples or implementation

540
00:27:53,350 --> 00:28:00,299
roles thanks very much for your

541
00:27:56,649 --> 00:28:00,299
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>
