1
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:12,230
our next speaker<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be</font>

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:21,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussing the ipv6 routing table in</font>

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:25,009
2010 yeah Jim cow Ephraim minuses thanks

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,360
so when I propose doing this talk this

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time I ever stood up here</font>

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,598
and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a v6 talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right you've heard me</font>

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:34,309
do a lot of v4 talks first time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a v6</font>

8
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,559
talk so somebody actually told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I</font>

9
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:39,440
would rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> be poked in the eye with a</font>

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,399
sharp stick and see another state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,550
v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> table talk I thought that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,929
little bit unsure tible put it there's a

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,669
reason for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right we've seen a lot of</font>

14
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,559
these you've seen this happen before

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,129
today I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something a</font>

16
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,089
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> different than you normally see</font>

17
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,440
what we're going to do today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is instead</font>

18
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classic thing where you see the</font>

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefix count in the v6 table creeping up</font>

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,149
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take a look at the v6</font>

21
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:08,119
table and its participants in terms of

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,619
the v4 table where I know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and</font>

23
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,030
you'll forgive me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I mess up some of</font>

24
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:13,640
the v6 language because I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">been following it what we're going to</font>

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,000
see today is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look into</font>

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the v6 table find all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a esas find</font>

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,230
all the relationships between them and

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,610
then go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try to explain that</font>

30
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,510
structure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of what they're</font>

31
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,860
already doing the v4 table then we'll

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of prefixes</font>

33
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,610
they're advertising how reach ability is

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,190
shaping up whether it's just a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

35
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,110
islands<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out something</font>

36
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how long a prefix you can have</font>

37
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,240
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will generally be reachable in the</font>

38
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,890
v6 table and again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous</font>

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,339
talk shows it really clearly that's

40
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,410
where all the hard work is this problem

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,440
isn't going to go away we've all become

42
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,520
resigned to the problem when v4 gets

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,020
exhausted this will have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed so</font>

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,619
the question classic question is what

45
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:04,220
took you so long well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

46
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,930
move all the v6 haters out first

47
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,690
Renesys has been looking at this problem

48
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:11,030
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay watching it watching</font>

49
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,560
and watching it it's been a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,350
occasionally somebody would pop up to

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,460
say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys study the v6 table too and</font>

52
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:21,620
we'd say well we could we got some

53
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,730
interest now there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the last six</font>

54
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,680
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've really had enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

55
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,450
coming to us and saying hey we could v6

56
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,250
pier with you now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have enough</font>

57
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,890
full tables to really start doing with

58
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,720
v6 what we've always done with v4 which

59
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,089
is mine it for relationships and figure

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,870
out what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on economically and</font>

61
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,190
listen trending and as I'll show you we

62
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,050
still don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

63
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,670
there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why this is the first</font>

64
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,010
talk we squeezed out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this so anyway</font>

65
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,910
let's give it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> shot for what it's worth</font>

66
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,070
the first thing you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

67
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,359
is the implications of the fact that the

68
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,489
way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work is that there</font>

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,100
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two tables it's not one table</font>

70
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was a decision way back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v4</font>

71
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,630
internet was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be embedded in</font>

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,700
v6 we were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again and so</font>

73
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,100
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two internets one of them is</font>

74
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,649
trying to turn into the other one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

75
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,359
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptions</font>

76
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,950
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens if you want</font>

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end product to look like today's</font>

78
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet but better almost all of the</font>

79
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,670
business relationships that built the v4

80
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet are going to have to pour it</font>

81
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:27,440
over to v6 or go away the existing

82
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,269
internet really grew organically and I

83
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,320
think one of the reasons that there's a

84
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there weren't</font>

85
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,670
enough people at the decision point

86
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,290
originally who had launched who had

87
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to build a social media company</font>

88
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,120
and failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we did a little vet it's</font>

89
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,680
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to make large numbers of</font>

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">people do what you want no matter how</font>

91
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,500
cool the technology is right adoption

92
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,750
has to be drawn based on what people's

93
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,410
own self-interest says once you get

94
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,540
beyond some scale so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it possible to</font>

95
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,359
replicate the existing v4 internet piece

96
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,590
by piece by piece in the v6 space it's

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,840
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

98
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,430
graph of autonomous systems and their

99
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,530
relationships you should actually be

100
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:11,360
able to kind of sense how far along that

101
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:13,580
replication curve we have come<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,540
terms of reasonable expectations the

103
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,830
reason we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

104
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,620
about prefix counts is that we

105
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:21,380
expect the v6 table to be much much much

106
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,850
smaller it's part of part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purpose</font>

107
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this whole exercise was to aggregate</font>

108
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,750
better and to have fewer little tiny

109
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,530
things floating around keep the table

110
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,400
size down but as I said before

111
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,080
autonomous systems are different from

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,969
prefixes every autonomous system

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,800
represents some organization made the

114
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,440
commitment to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves on the</font>

115
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,500
internet and get registered and

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,480
potentially be multihomed if you expect

117
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,240
the v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to converge to fewer</font>

118
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,680
autonomous systems overall you're going

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,780
to have to tell all those people that

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,250
they're giving up their economic choice

121
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the potential at least two</font>

122
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,380
multi-home and may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been possible</font>

123
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">before in this day and age there's tens</font>

124
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,260
of thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations that are</font>

125
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,650
probably going to dig in their heels and

126
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,830
say I need multiple providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need p I</font>

127
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,299
space I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have on the v6 internet</font>

128
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,370
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> economic freedom to</font>

129
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:18,350
choose and replace my<font color="#E5E5E5"> transit providers</font>

130
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:21,200
that I had in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> V force base if you</font>

131
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">just take a look at the bear numbers and</font>

132
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,930
there's there's 34 to 35,000 autonomous

133
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,340
systems in use in before and the

134
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,370
breakdown is you've seen this breakdown

135
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,900
in my previous talks to forty percent or

136
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,210
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> are single homes forty percent of</font>

137
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sarah dual home and the fifteen percent</font>

138
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,669
of them that are in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room are triple</font>

139
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,799
home door more so that's a lot of

140
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,900

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:54,800
potentially to v6 and v6 so far only

149
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,870
point out we have a paucity of data to

150
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,690
really understand the economics a lot of

151

those relationships envy for its large

152
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,150
enough there's a lot of context we can

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">often infer based on context for every</font>

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,820
does that relationship go who's the

156
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,070
provider who's the customer or are they

157
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,430
equals of some sort

158
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:33,110
in v6 there's less information to allow

159
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,100
you to make those inferences so what

160
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,350
we're going to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at the</font>

174
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,100
personally see with hundreds of peering

about buying v6 transit may mean that

<font color="#E5E5E5">people can't get v6 from the people who</font>

because there are other providers who

are stepping up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and selling it and the</font>

somebody is you know getting their feet

212
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,030
wet with v6 but you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

213
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,040
seriously economically so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

214
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:52,630
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these new new edges that crept</font>

215

has never been<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen in the v4 table if</font>

218
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,870
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the organizations who are</font>

220
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:09,910
there's no surprise the guys over at 69

221
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:12,220
39 have been setting things up over 400

just don't exist in the v4 land<font color="#E5E5E5"> TI net</font>

224
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,930
at their heels with over 130 and then

225
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,550
there's a long tail most people of

226
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">course the average person has just one</font>

227
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:28,810
fresh v6 connection that he ginned up so

228
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,219
you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the v6 net in as you think</font>

229
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this it's what you what you might</font>

235
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,170
you went to where there were providers

236
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,969
who had large numbers of adjacencies and

237
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,030
we're sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of demonstrably healthy</font>

238
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,920
providers and you would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> there first</font>

239
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,079
there may be a similar thing kicking in

<font color="#E5E5E5">Anna v6 net if you take those edges</font>

242
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,939

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">esas this is unusual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution here so seven percent of</font>

them are brand new people<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe gut</font>

246
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,990
guess is that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

247
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,979
for v6 maybe it's a mistake seventeen

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,480
percent of them are single home

252
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,110
now this tells you who these people are

253
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,360
who are ginning up new relationships on

254
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,790
the v6 net they're not you know your

255
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,070
typical bank in Idaho or something these

256
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,230

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,270
core infrastructure

260
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:47,820
so you have to ask where's the v4 edge

261
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:52,930
right all the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't here</font>

262
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:55,180
out of the 34,500 ipv4 a esas of course

263
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,459
you know the vast majority 29,000 of

264
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,859
them don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody downstream about</font>

265
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">half of those are multi hung if you look</font>

266
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,220
at v6 you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else very</font>

267
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,750
strange people who have nobody

268
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,550
downstream of them represent eighty-four

269
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,380
percent of the v4 net they only

270
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:15,430
represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty-six percent of the v6</font>

271
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,960
net okay so this is an inversion it's

272
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,229
telling you that there's a population of

273
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,630
a esas that are not getting into v6

274
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,460
they're running the other direction so

275
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,950
you have to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself is there some</font>

276
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,710
misalignment of incentives or are the

277
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,510
people who are at the edge witnessing

278
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,160
some disincentive to get to get

279
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,420
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> over you get registered in</font>

280
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:41,110
the v6 space here's a visualization oh

281
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:44,229
good it shows up well think of the of

it something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the distribution of</font>

364

might expect a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty five percent</font>

365
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:18,399
of them are 48 and then you see some

366
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,269
resonances at forty and fifty six but

367
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,319
that's basically pretty much the picture

368
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,939
so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical question here</font>

369
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:26,769
about visibility whenever you look at

370
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:28,959
the table you know there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

371
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:30,549
routes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and no matter how</font>

372
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,869
you construct your definition of a full

00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:34,799
table there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

374
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:37,179
routes that are only seen by a pure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

375
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know they're more specifics</font>

376
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:39,639
that only they show their customers

377
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,230
they're showing you because you're a

378
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,449
data collector but it's not really meant

379
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,189
to be globally visible so we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

380
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:47,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out what the what global</font>

381
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:49,449
visibility means which is of course hard

382
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,799
we won't figure out what the equivalent

383
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:58,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 / 8 and / 24 might be for ipv6 well</font>

384
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:59,919
mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the equivalent of / 24 and this</font>

385
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,540
is important because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

386
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,579
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing table size is</font>

387
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,769
going to grow keeping the routing table

388
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:11,618
compact in v6 was a driving core

389
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:13,540
principle and we want to see how the

390
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:15,490
availability of more specifics in the v6

391
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,610
table is going to grow the table in the

392
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,839
future and as I say it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard to</font>

393
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,389
tell when something is globally

394
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,860
reachable with capital G capital R you

395
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,919
can you basically pick your rule of

396
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,629
thumb and and you work with it we use

397
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,669
one here that's that sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

398
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:32,470
sense if i pick up here at random out of

399
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:33,910
my hundreds of peers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want at least a</font>

400
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,809
ninety percent chance that they see a

401
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,459
prefix then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say if i go to</font>

402
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:41,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">a random place on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet i can</font>

403
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:43,748
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach that prefix ninety</font>

404
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,419
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that v4 internet</font>

405
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:49,299
works is you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good agreement</font>

406
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:52,149
on basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large range of lengths</font>

407
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:56,139
you get eighty to ninety six plus

408
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:58,299
percent of reach ability for things on

409
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:00,189
and off classical boundaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> from ninety</font>

410
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,540
percent appears and that's good that's

411
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:06,099
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want that's what the internet</font>

412
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:08,949
is right it's rough consensus on filter

413
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:11,049
settings and agreement that things that

414
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generally visible can be generally</font>

415
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:20,690
held to be visible

416
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:24,589
so in v6 it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 32 s 92% that's</font>

417
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:26,690
on a par with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best of v6 or vivo it</font>

418
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,190
goes down from there a little bit and

419
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:35,150
primarily this is because you're mixing

420
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:36,890
PA<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpi space prefixes right in in v6 you</font>

421
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,870
might not expect people to pass things

422
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,170

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,429
up their supposed to kind of go away and

424
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,910
so the reach ability for things like a

425
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,530
48 which is 48 portable 48 is where we

426
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,180
expect to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Oort cloud show up</font>

427
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:55,430
when they finally make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it onto the v6</font>

428
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:57,110
net 67% reach ability so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

429
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,580
as bad as that because if you if you go

430
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,750
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just look at the p.i space</font>

431
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,730
remember p I<font color="#CCCCCC"> space in v6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fairly</font>

432
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">young concept I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there was</font>

433
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,540
going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of support for P I</font>

434
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,920
space originally and then it became

435
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,350
clear that not everybody wanted to

436
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,730
become an li are in order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

437
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:18,620
own space and people started going out

438
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,150
and saying you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afrinic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

439
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,340
remember set up a policy and said we're

440
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,790
giving out some P I space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font>

441
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,290
swamp and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difficult thing was that</font>

442
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,060
then there were very large providers

443
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,800
very you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> top tier providers who I</font>

444
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,780
won't name who said well we're not going

445
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,600
to propagate<font color="#E5E5E5"> those 48 because there</font>

446
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,840
longer than 32 and there's there's no

447
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,340
RFC governing this and and there was a

448
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of thought that went on basically</font>

449
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">over kind of the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timeline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

455
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,830

458

codes here show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different links</font>

the registries at each length you see

462
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,040
that the gray of course is 48 so the

463
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,260
vast majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

diversity there's some 3242<font color="#CCCCCC"> 36-35</font>

467
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,710

ability that's a great result you just

470
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,220
wish there were some more of them

471
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,160
because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still talking about</font>

472
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,500
hundreds of prefixes and remember we

473
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,770
have 107,000 relationships that have to

474
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,180
get ported and so my summary here is

475
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,879
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to how to</font>

476
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,730
reinvent avise the edge six percent of

477
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,500
the relationships show up and there's a

478
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,200
significant bias here we're preaching to

479
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,250
the choir the people who are getting

480
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,260
recruited here are the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

481
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,660
already highly multihomed who know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

482
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,640
this is necessary the non provider

483
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:07,410
enterprises are the ones who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> staying</font>

484
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,820
away in droves three percent if you say

485
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,770
the ones who really are sophisticates

486
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,730
the multi homers<font color="#CCCCCC"> is four percent okay</font>

487
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,440
the only other interesting thing I just

488
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say it twice twenty-nine percent</font>

489
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,140
the relationships in v6 table are new

490
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,550
again that may<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that people have</font>

491
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,560
some dissatisfaction with existing

492
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,470
transit providers who can't get it get

493
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,300
the v6 support that they're asking for

494
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,730
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of coincidental that</font>

495
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,180
this makes the nanog meeting attendance

496
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,500
look kind of similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the v6 table in</font>

497
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,580
the sense that twenty-nine percent of

498
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,460
the nanog attendees are also

499
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">first-timers and the rest of them are</font>

500
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,770
sophisticates I don't know it's a bad

501
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,570
analogy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just clear that we're in</font>

502
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,450
the we're still in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> early days I'm</font>

503
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:56,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to do this talk again and</font>

504
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:58,680
again the ipv4 is a huge rich ecosystem

505
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,629
it's going to take time it's like taking

506
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> united states and rebuilding it</font>

507

street by street on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moon you know</font>

508
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,230
where this is going to take a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

509
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,540
so i exhort you to appear with us of

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:14,030
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can keep watching see</font>

what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i conclude</font>

513
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,220
slide 20 I think you seem to suggest

514
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:35,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's not a lot of reach ability</font>

515
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:37,610
to / 48 in general and then on slide 21

516
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,460
you seem to suggest that reach ability

517
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:45,860
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pie 48 and larger seems to be quite</font>

518
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:49,340
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> so is the corollary true which is</font>

519
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:52,490
that PA 48 generally don't have good

520
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,740
reach ability yes thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lets you got</font>

521
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,470
it right that's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it means</font>

522
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:01,420
sorry I didn't quantify it Randy Randy

out of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own space yep whether</font>

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:18,440
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing for v6 multihoming</font>

527
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:23,510
and v6 in general is an interesting

528
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:28,280
topic for discussion certainly is Leo

<font color="#CCCCCC">bicknell is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> C I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring a couple</font>

of different perspectives there because

531
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,629
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it helps explain your new and</font>

novel and some of that kind of stuff I

533
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,890

538
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,310
also micro allocations yeah and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

539
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,620
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 48 that have root servers in</font>

540
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:57,320
them that people might like to get to so

541
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,560
you know not all 48 sardaar Joe's bait

542
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,800
and tackle and also not all micro

543
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:08,000
allocations are 48 the root server i

544
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:10,310

allow 32 s and 48 your stillness on the

and and there are numerous other

548
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,200
examples you can go to the are errors

549
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,500
and pull them but on the new and novel

550
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,920
front we do operate servers in 50

551
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,990
locations around the world right now and

552
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,440
we have a goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ipv6 enable all of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">them they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not all ipv6 enabled for</font>

554
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,450
various reasons you know if you want to

555
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,040
I pv6 enable something in Amsterdam you

pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much fall over people offering</font>

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,600
weird tunnels and other stuff to make

00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">things happen and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suspect what you'll</font>

564
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,490
see as many of those new and novel isn't

565
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,440
that we're dissatisfied with our peer

566
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:02,380
it's that we really do want to lead them

567
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,360
and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things will go away it's not</font>

568
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,980
an attempt to to bypass them or find

569
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:11,979
some new better kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of provider it's</font>

570
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:14,170
just in terms of adoption the core has

<font color="#CCCCCC">to be there before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise's can</font>

00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,130
jump and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I keep hearing this in the</font>

573
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,830
Aaron and their<font color="#CCCCCC"> dog forums you know the</font>

574
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,620
this this blue edges as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe it</font>

575
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,419
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go encourage them I don't</font>

576
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,479
know why we have to encourage them we

577
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:31,240
have to get our piece done and when they

578
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,010
need it and you can all come up with

579
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,950
your own driver though they'll buy it

580
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,810
they'll ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it they'll whatever I I</font>

581
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,760
don't think there is any encouragement

582
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,500
there's no amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and talking</font>

583
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,720
to Bob at Joe's bait and tackle and

584
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,070
saying you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to enable v6 at</font>

585
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,110
some point he'll need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because you</font>

586
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't get space or his new application</font>

587
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,820
needs it or whatever we better have our

588
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,590
piece done yeah way<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that so he's</font>

589
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,179
confident we can do it the funny thing

590
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,860
is that Joe's bait and tackle already

591
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,110
did this once he thought he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was done he</font>

592
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,000
got an AS he got some address space he

593
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,939
pays fees every year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's all good</font>

594
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,190
and ready to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why I got pay again</font>

595
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,440
don't you and the thing is though for a

596
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,960
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those organizations he may be</font>

597
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,970
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 10 more years right because V</font>

598
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,830
for this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem before doesn't</font>

599
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop working even when everybody's out</font>

600
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,300
of address space he keeps on working for

601
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,658
some period of time eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll</font>

602
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,029
have a driver

603
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:25,369
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's an awful lot of</font>

604
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:28,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">energy being expended trying to convince</font>

605
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:31,668
these people to jump today yeah and I

606
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:33,228
think it's misplaced we're spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

607
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,499
lot of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources on something that</font>

608
00:25:33,229 --> 00:25:38,330
doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to him and and we</font>

609
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:40,999
just need to give it some time that it

610
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,859
will happen in due course for a variety

611
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:45,289
of reasons outside of our control good

612
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:46,789
points all and in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of micro</font>

613
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:48,889
allocations we have seen stuff as long

00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,070
suing you but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to check the</font>

623
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,349
shareholders agreement um and I can't

624
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,999
decide if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a compliment or an insult</font>

625
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:19,299
but as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do if it is an insult</font>

626
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:22,399
it may be slander as well so I'm just

627
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:25,158
letting you know thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for the</font>

629
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,149
of the v6 and likened it to a sexually

630
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:31,489
transmitted infection rather than a

631
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:34,748
networking protocol I did turn up the

632
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:37,220
first v6 peers before i left Renesys so

633
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:39,139
that's true we owe all of our v6

634
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:49,970
collection infrastructure impetus to

635
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:52,459
that man right there cool one more Jason

637
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,799
that Leo just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the edges</font>

638
00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:00,320
coming later to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game and when they</font>

639
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:02,408
need v6 they will come and we really

640
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,939
shouldn't be in the position of

641
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:09,830
encouraging them to plunge feet first

642
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,629
into ipv6 now however I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

643
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,119
important to give them a little wisdom

644
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:17,209
and to give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little guidance and</font>

645
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:21,199
caution and that is the day will come

646
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:23,239
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do v6 and they need to</font>

647
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,489
plan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that when that day does</font>

648
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:29,720
arrive there's not suddenly an emergency

649
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:33,200
and a problem that they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

650
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,470
solved so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been recommending to</font>

651
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,630
to our customers is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yes go ahead and</font>

652
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,450
do v6 if your equipment doesn't

653
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,039
currently support it go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy some</font>

654
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,769
equipment that does make a minimal

655
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,950
investment set it up in a lab<font color="#CCCCCC"> setting up</font>

656
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:51,380
in the corner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

657
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,059
what your v6 configuration is going to

658
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,840
be what you're addressing plan is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

659
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be make sure that v6 is going to work</font>

660
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,879
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your particular architecture and</font>

661
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,260
deployment and figure out all the things

662
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are broken in your back office</font>

663
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:09,440
which tends to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pole in</font>

664
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:11,779
the tent and scope how much time and how

665
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,500
much cost it's going to be to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

666
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:17,750
be v6 ready and at least do that minimal

667
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,990
work so that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're</font>

668
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:23,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of cost in time to</font>

669
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:26,269
be v6 capable so that when you do see

670
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:29,029
that finish line of oh crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really do</font>

671
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:30,409
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do v6 because there's some v6</font>

672
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:33,559
network that we suddenly do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

673
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:35,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you or suddenly our need for IP</font>

674
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,418
addressing is once again growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

675
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:41,779
we've run out so that you're basically

676
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:43,940
ready for that transition yeah it's a

677
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:45,529
long long process and you know people

678
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get off the dime unless they see</font>

679
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,950
it it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take if only somebody</font>

680
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,840
would give out stimulus checks for a

681
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:53,450
thousand bucks to become v6 ready you

682
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,320
know come no seriously fig couldn't

683
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,740
figure out how much would that cost

684
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:03,439
multiply it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 35,000 people</font>

685
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that'd be cheap let's do that sorry yeah</font>

686
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matt pound set from filius you're asking</font>

687
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,570
earlier on here if there was some sort

688
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,529
of disincentive for the edge networks

689
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:17,120
getting on and it's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this they</font>

690
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:19,220
already mentioned is it's more of an

691
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,229
absence of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> incentive right the the</font>

692
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,179
way the rationale goes I've talked to a

693
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,970
bunch of assistant mins and network

694
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:27,649
admins for enterprises through you know

695
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,230
sage lists and lobsta and stuff like

696
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:32,149
that over the last couple of years and

697
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,789
the rationale usually goes something

698
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:36,889
along the lines of well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never need</font>

699
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,080
new IP addresses everything we have sits

700
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:41,149
behind a NAT

701
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,580
you know so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to worry about</font>

702
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting v6 in order to put stuff on the</font>

703
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:49,610
network and you know everybody who's

704
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:51,500
already online has before addresses and

705
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,550
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going away so we're still</font>

706
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,640
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to talk to them even</font>

707
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:57,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">after the run out occurs and so yeah so</font>

708
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,960
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looking at it as you know</font>

709
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,490
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know maybe in five years</font>

710
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,990
there will be some little tiny

711
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,750
percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the internet that I can't</font>

712
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,190
reach because they're only on v6 but but

713
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,100
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a tiny percent in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

714
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,800
years away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

715
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of where they sit right now</font>

716
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,840
and so like jason says there's probably

717
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,970
some value in in putting effort into

718
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,620
encouraging those people to start

719
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,020
thinking about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's absolutely</font>

720
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">no value in them actually making the</font>

721
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:34,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">leap right now it's accurate okay maybe</font>

722
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,830
last question we wrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up on the long</font>

723
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,740
hurricane electric we have some

724
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,330
visibility into the some of those new

725
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,240
relationships who<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about and</font>

726
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,580
I i can say that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them are</font>

727
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,350
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have trouble getting v6</font>

728
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,929
services from the resisting

729
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:53,149
relationships or simply feel that they

730
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:55,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a better v6 experience by</font>

731
00:30:53,150 --> 00:31:02,440
choosing a provider that has a bit more

732
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:05,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">v6 experience we see you in the stats</font>

733
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,930
one hour John Curran Arin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to</font>

734
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:12,980
reply to some of the prior speakers

735
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:15,560
regarding v6 incentives so try to make

736
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,050
this short and simple you can tell

737
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,870
someone you should look at v6 so you can

738
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:23,240
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready for when you need it but in the</font>

739
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,669
list of priorities whether it's a small

740
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,650
business or a large business<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

741
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,600
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's looking at something so</font>

742
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,970
they'll be theoretically ready it's

743
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to fall below fixing</font>

744
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,870
real-world problems so a lot of these

745
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,470
organizations actually need a hard

746
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,879
tangible goal to work for and it's not

747
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,850
turn on v6 throughout your organization

748
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,530
that's not it they as someone said

749
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,300
earlier all their devices are behind

750
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,820
that they don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to addresses it's</font>

751
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,530
not a problem from but<font color="#CCCCCC"> their public</font>

752
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,020
facing serve

753
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:57,080
their web server and their mail server

754
00:31:54,020 --> 00:32:00,560
in particular their web server is going

755
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be accessed by people increasingly by</font>

756
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,899
v4 and v6 users and if they just being

757
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,310
tainted on v4 then they're eventually

758
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,710
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have trouble because the</font>

759
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:12,590
connectivity over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next five years</font>

760
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,930
for a v4 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> website becomes more and</font>

761
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:18,649
more convoluted as the rest of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

762
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:21,260
using v6 to hook up customers so if you

763
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,780
want a simple goal to say if they'd like

764
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,610
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end packet connection they</font>

765
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,800
probably want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a home their public</font>

766
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,719
websites and begin working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that and</font>

767
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,879
that's a tangible goal that doesn't

768
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,920
require all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the desktops doesn't</font>

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,160
require going<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the firewall it</font>

770
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,530
does require them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to isps to</font>

771
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,510
get their<font color="#E5E5E5"> dmz firewall running to figure</font>

784
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:13,520
right one is it time for a brief comment

785
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:16,820
yeah forensic lady Google I I think

786
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,610
there's no really there's there's this

787
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,379
not surprising that me the networks that

788
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,479
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving to ipv6 are the ones that are</font>

789
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,970
are going to face<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know big problems</font>

790
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,000
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's basically a scanning issue</font>

791
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:31,250
right so small enterprises might not

792
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,050
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for next few years and as you</font>

793
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,400
it's interesting to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

794
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,740
actually born out by your statistics

795
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,720
like the big the big networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

796
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">core they're doing their bit if you look</font>

797
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,790
at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the residential eyes peas</font>

798
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,020
it's comcast right and it's AT&T that

799
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,580
are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

800
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,740
content providers people at Google and

801
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,129
Facebook fairly near in charge right

802
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:54,050
maybe it'll just it's a just natural

803
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,670
growth and the big networks have to face

804
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,139
this problem first we can hope that

805
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,520
that's true that the adoption curve

806
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,110
looks like the adoption curve for

807
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,910
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consumer good where the</font>

808
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,629
early people suffer and it's expensive

809
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,490
that's you

810
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,740
and the other guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are free riders and</font>

811
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:11,280
they creep in I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> still done on a DVD</font>
