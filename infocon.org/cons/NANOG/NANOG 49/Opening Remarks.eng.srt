providing the kool-aid thanks Dave so

155
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">dave said he got to do the practical</font>

156
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,090
presentation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got to do the</font>

157
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,620
esoteric presentation so here goes so

158
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,359
when the folks at netflix first started

159
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,419
seriously planning a streaming offering

160
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,740
some time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2005 or so there was a</font>

161
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment when we made the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decision that</font>

162
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,260
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to bank on</font>

163
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,630
streaming DVD quality movies via HTTP

164
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,570
two devices that had very<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited memory</font>

165
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,490
buffer and no hard disk we made that

166
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,979
decision by doing scientific things like

167
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,419
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our broadband data rates</font>

168
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,010
at home and how they've evolved over

169
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,900
time and deciding that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to</font>

170
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,080
double every 18 months or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that so</font>

171
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,849
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> must be following</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Moore's law this</font>

172
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,219
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> also presupposed that is the</font>

173
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,990
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> grew so with the capacity of all</font>

174
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,050
the intermediate networks required to

175
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,700
get the data to our subscribers since

176
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,470
then we have gone on to see the service

177
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,990
broadly adopted by our customers on a

178
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,760
tremendous<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of devices which adds</font>

179
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,390
up to hundreds of gigabits per second on

180
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,890
of traffic every night on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

181
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,630
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I come to an an auger and see</font>

182
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,949
all of you crazy people it reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

183
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,360
that this is all made possible by the

184
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,970
stuff you do every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you go to</font>

185
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,380
work from ordering cross connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

190
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,769

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet go</font>

192
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,380
which means our subscribers can watch

193
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,019
movies until their friends how cool it

194
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,339
is so the cycle continues not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all the other stuff the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is</font>
