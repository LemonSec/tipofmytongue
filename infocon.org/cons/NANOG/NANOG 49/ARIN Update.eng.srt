9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,369

37
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,650
some transparency there is a way of

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,450
mapping two and four so to the extent

39
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,729
that you're not currently supporting

because they can't use them so I this is

46
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,420
an important discussion again if people

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,979
think that this isn't important and we

let me know but as it is we don't see

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,840

who is servers

55
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,120
is true we actually deployed a lot of

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,100
infrastructure in 2009 and as we did the

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,800
query rate went up so that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

58
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,450
probably rate throttle before then there

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,100
is some queries on this that are self

earlier someone doing who is query and

64
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,630
the who is from that's about half of

65
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,730
this traffic and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe tapering off</font>

66
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,769
we still don't know what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're</font>

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">still looking at it talking to people</font>

68
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,630

of who is traffic and people are using

this in their automation they're using

71
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,150
this in their spam work they're using it

72
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:08,420
in their tools so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving to a more</font>

73
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,550
efficient infrastructure we've changed

automation work going on is to rebuild

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,130
how we do who is and make a full actual

77
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,670
service interface we are replacing the

existing who is service on jun 26 this

<font color="#E5E5E5">is a major upgrade this new one is a</font>

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,179
it's more efficient it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> matches</font>

88
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,630
43 so there's a legacy support on port

89
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:54,109
43 there are some minor changes because

90
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,530
that legacy support is a a client<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:11,540
if you're doing screen scraping of who

is sessions on port 43 now that we have

97

restful who is that's the protocol we

98
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,260
prefer you to do queries it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly</font>

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,570
good time to update your interfaces and

102
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,160
make use of the restful language we know

109
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,530
people to move to a programmatic

110
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,680
interface as opposed to doing the screen

144
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,640
we're going to give it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but at</font>

145
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,200
some point in the future we may not have

146
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,780
it and that's when we expect people to

147
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,090
be listed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the service for</font>

150
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,020
been abandoned sort of what I mean

151
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,120
abandoned is there's a contact it's out

152
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,370
there but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily being</font>

153
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
heavily used or someone's using it in

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,240
efficiently in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them off</font>

155

156
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,680
work this allows someone who has a

157
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,180

a better use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's what the community</font>

160
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,050
asked us to do the transfer listing

161
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,490
service lets people find parties that

162
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,370
have these address blocks or fine

parties that need them who is RWS we

that's appropriate for them to do and as

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,410
part of that they'll also work on

191
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,880
getting the inital opera signed when

will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a change coming up to in turn up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a dns service expect information later</font>

200
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,289
on the summer our pki<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think everyone</font>

201
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">knows what that is but it's the resource</font>

202
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,870
our rpki effort is the ability to do

203
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,450
digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificates representing</font>

204
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,730
resource assignments which would allow

205
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,800
you then to actually sign your own

206
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,150
announcements for example there's an

207
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,750
online trial people who want to

208
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,340
participate should go online and get

209
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,230
involved we have comments from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

210
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,640
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say they want this but</font>

211
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,430
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of participants so</font>

212
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,049
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get involved there's very</font>

213
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,729
good information online there's also

214
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,609
good public libraries out there that you

215
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,990
can use we like more users of this right

216
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:52,080
now we're being guided by a very small

217
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">community out there outreach so yeah</font>

218
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron is doing a lot of outreach we are</font>

219
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:01,839
doing literally dozens of presentations

220
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,860
each quarter to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community including</font>

221
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:09,790
public forums including events<font color="#CCCCCC"> like CES</font>

222
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:13,120
and interop and then moving out into

223
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,550
more traditional media talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,550

229
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,660
someone noted earlier there's probably

230
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:34,149
some 35,000 autonomous systems that are

231
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,029
impacted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the change the need to start</font>

236
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,878
in v6 so you can go online you can see

237
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,680
the presentations we're doing you can

238
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,569
also see the outreach where we've

239
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,359
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> been there's a public</font>

out of v4 talks about v6 deployment

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,889
that's a public slide deck for you to

250
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,060
we've had a couple of policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font>

been adopted<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are pending</font>

allocation criteria was rewritten fairly

254
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:31,779
extensively one interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> implication</font>

255
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:33,969
is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're multihomed are imminently</font>

bulky home today that is a valid

257
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,709
qualification for v6 space and you'll

258
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:41,560
get a / 32 that's an important change

259
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:44,229
for people to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> mm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a transfer policy</font>

and we clarified that with the M&A

transfer policy one side effect of that
