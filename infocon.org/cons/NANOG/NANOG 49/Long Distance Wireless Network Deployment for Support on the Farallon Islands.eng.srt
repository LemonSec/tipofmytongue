nanog for hosting us and I know that

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,349
Matt wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say thanks because this</font>

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,300
has nothing to do with his curve

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,950
employer that's watching the stream

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,899
sorry i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about work anyway</font>

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">i want to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little bit about</font>

13
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-distance wireless deployments and</font>

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,070
particularly into remote areas like the

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,780
Farallon Islands we were asked when I

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,059
first submitted this they wanted to know

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,559
a little bit about the troubles and how

18
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,010
we planned it and things like that so

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into some details</font>

20
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,928
perhaps if nanog wants to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,428
little bit more detail like a a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday</font>

22
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,589
morning session on how to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind</font>

23
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:03,829
of stuff we can do that but this is

24
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:05,239
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really abbreviated so hard</font>

25
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">meats are sort of rushing through some</font>

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:12,439
of the details on this so anyway the

27
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:19,840
fair lawn's let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say how do we go</font>

28
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:25,820
forward I guess we just click<font color="#E5E5E5"> no click</font>

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:29,030
that great so you want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah restaurantes share too many</font>

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,899
microphones here so Tim and I have been

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,659
building networks and pretty crazy

33
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,340
places for a while I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

34
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,170
deployments in Bhutan Burning Man other

35
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,380
crazy places so we're sort of used to

36
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,149
doing strange deployments what was

37
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,339
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this one is with a lot</font>

38
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:49,579
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stakeholders involved because the</font>

39
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,380
island is actually technically managed

40
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,048
by Fish and Wildlife there's a lot of

41
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,048
third parties involved it's much more

42
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,189
difficult than typically just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

43
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,859
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street and dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

44
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:04,600

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Farallones these are basically</font>

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,560
about 50 kilometers or 30 miles or about

47
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:12,170
if you're not into the metric system

48
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,750
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the golden gate bridge from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">San</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco and they're technically</font>

50
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,500
officially part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> city</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> San</font>

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,280
Francisco in accounting and they're only

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,860
accessible by boat or hell

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,630
copter travel time<font color="#E5E5E5"> is anywhere from 30</font>

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,360
minutes to five hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

55
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:30,410
method<font color="#E5E5E5"> of transportation and it's just</font>

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,580
right before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the continental shelf ends</font>

57
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,609
effectively where the water<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font>

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,900
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know thousands of feet the the</font>

59
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,319
islands are interesting because they

60
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">sustain a fairly large bird breeding</font>

61
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,200
colony one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest south of</font>

62
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,500
Alaska and<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently contains thirty</font>

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,940
percent of California's nesting seabirds

64
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,410
there's a number of species there so

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,609
it's definitely a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very active site</font>

66
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,100
what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is actually</font>

67
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,410
getting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this site it's extremely</font>

68
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,320
limited and a privilege to be invited

69
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,950
there it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a wilderness</font>

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,170
exercise in many senses access is

71
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,290
physically limited there's no peer

72
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,720
there's no dock there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beach it's</font>

73
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,489
it's a real process to get on there so

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,500
the first step is taking a boat to get

75
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,690
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is generally around 4am</font>

76
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,110
you get there around six or seven a.m.

77
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,150
you can get on a small zodiac that

78
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,799
zodiac<font color="#CCCCCC"> is then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grabbed with a large</font>

79
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,049
crane where they actually crane and pull

80
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,489
out of the water about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 feet and then</font>

81
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:38,010
swing you over to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> island so it's</font>

82
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,420
it's quite an experience you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

83
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this that you know six in</font>

84
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,179
the morning and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you down</font>

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,620
and you're good to go the islands are

86
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,570
effectively in the middle of the

87
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,410
shipping<font color="#E5E5E5"> lanes there's there's three</font>

88
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,420
major lanes from the north going east

89
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,329
and wesson from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> south into the</font>

90
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,030
Golden Gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bridge and it's the island</font>

91
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">eggs existed as up as a lighthouse since</font>

92
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,180
1855 and the peak of the islands about

93
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,700
370 feet so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large island</font>

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,489
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a great landmark you know if</font>

95
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,920
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going towards you know San</font>

96
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Francisco or towards Hawaii hopefully</font>

97
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,370
going the right direction you can

98
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,668
actually see the top half of the

99
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,970
lighthouse from San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

100
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:26,190
day which is a very rare and the finale

101
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">ends has actually been preserved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually see the original lighthouse</font>

103
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,380
over and the San Francisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> maritime</font>

104
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,539
museum your fisherman's work

105
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,480
you can see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple pictures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here of</font>

106
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,370
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the original design of the</font>

107
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,890
lighthouse by the Coast Guard who

108
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,750
continues to maintain it today it's of

109
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:47,020
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> been replaced with sort of modern</font>

110
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:51,160
technology solar rays newer lights that

111
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,979
sort of thing so why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved</font>

112
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,290
in this the island is communication is

113
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,900
extremely critical to the organization

114
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,750
there historically they've had some

115
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,609
pretty low-tech approaches to data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

116
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,030
even voice has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very challenging</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

117
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,160
them the only way that cell phones work

118
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,469
is from the lighthouse you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to climb</font>

119
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,680
all the way at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top it's about a 20</font>

120
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">minute walk if you're out of shape and</font>

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,610
once you get to the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the island</font>

122
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,800
then you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fine signal and it</font>

123
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,130
turns out that only the legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I banner</font>

124
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,320
or nextel now sprint technology works up

125
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,920
there none of the GSM works and as you

126
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:34,990
know amps is a no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists they've</font>

127
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:37,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">had some very legacy actually pre a 211</font>

128
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,090
be data some air in the slides there

129
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,850
that's somewhat worked but had some

130
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,460
major<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems we got involved because</font>

131
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,500
the last point there is one of the local

132
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,530
museums the California Academy of

133
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,510
Science wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> install a webcam and</font>

134
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,330
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that requirement needed to have</font>

135
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,340
sort of modern bandwidth capability the

136
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,680
other big change it's gone through a

137

<font color="#E5E5E5">huge transition in the island is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

138
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520

181
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:54,219
another one is is reliability so the

<font color="#E5E5E5">four to five scientist in rotation and</font>

184
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,979
their expertise is not an IP or an RF so

185
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,389
we wanted a solution where they're able

186
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:09,039
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> debug what's going on and something</font>

187
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,010
that makes it effective for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be</font>

able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remotely manage a solution and</font>

189
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,830
also debug problems in an easy way so

190
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,380
things like an LED that shows status of

191
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,270
the link cables that are clearly labeled

192
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,400
that sort of stuff that makes the

193
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Diagnostics easier was really important</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to this process second major point we</font>

195
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,169
looked at was was a site survey was this

196
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,909
even possible to upgrade the link the

nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is from an obstruction</font>

198

standpoint he only really probably had

199
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,088
was air there weren't any buildings in

200
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,969
the way we could see them<font color="#E5E5E5"> from multiple</font>

points in San Francisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next step in</font>

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:48,100
terms of a site survey is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're on the</font>

203
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,839

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,459
the island<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was fairly tricky</font>

205
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,889
because when you define a location I had

206
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,388
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bandwidth</font>

207
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,429
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a great partner and that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">was the City and County of San Francisco</font>

we installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> our wireless gear that</font>

shoots out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Farallones and then we're</font>

220

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit about the</font>

modeling and dive into the the RF needs

00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:36,988
of this design the other criteria that

223
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:38,399
we also had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with is in fact that</font>

224
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:41,429
since they generate their own power

225
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,470
there they have about they have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">15 kilowatt generators and such they</font>

227
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,519
really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to run diesel all the</font>

228
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,339
time out there they have about six

229
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,689
kilowatts worth of solar cells so we

230
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,540
were kind of limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 watts</font>

231
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:57,089
of power that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can put on the island</font>

232
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:59,399
which includes a flash media encoder

235
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,329
switch and such as well as a router so

236
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,189
we had to be very careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">solutions that we had which Matt's going</font>

radios which are ubiquitous a dios which

242
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:23,220
take about three to five watts worth of

243
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,929
power and such the we also had<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

244
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,869
limited mounting space on the island we

could not mount the antennas themselves

on to the lighthouse or the Coast Guard

247
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,209
would say fine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> own it now and the</font>

a problem we did have to do a little bit

of sniffing up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> san francisco end</font>

sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> modeling you're going to have to</font>

up there because likely you're going to

<font color="#CCCCCC">invest you know quite a bit of gear and</font>

283
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,630
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a another product</font>

284
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,250
called path loss which does path

285
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,770
profiles which I'll talk about in a

286
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,300
second a little less expensive then

287
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,060
there's product out there called radio

288
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,670
mobile that's made in Canada that's free

289
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,979
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of committee wireless folks</font>

290
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,630
are using out there so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

291
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google radio mobile you'll find it there</font>

292
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,830
it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually does and</font>

293
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,550
what it does some really nice tie REM

294
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:20,220
and propagation modeling and such again

295
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,719
more cash more accurate so again we get

296
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,190
into some better modeling you get some

297
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,340
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> up time prediction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and such for</font>

298
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,830
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive packages the things</font>

299
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to model are typically what's</font>

300
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,850
called link budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> path profile</font>

301
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,130
atmospherics modeling and interference

302
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,320
and such link budget which will go into

303
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,640
here in a second which has to do is are

304
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">you going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have enough signal on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

305
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,680
other end to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it the path</font>

306
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:46,140
profile is look at instructions length

307
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,630
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path and such a bastard modeling</font>

308
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,490
is try to predict the<font color="#E5E5E5"> uptime depending</font>

309
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">on like for instance rain fade and such</font>

310
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,070
and then interference to others in the

311
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,170
path is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like is</font>

312
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,610
the antenna that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pick make</font>

313
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,290
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's going to not necessarily</font>

314
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:06,540
pick up signals from adjacent

315
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,510
transmitters and such so you can use

316
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:13,079
against software for that kind of stuff

317
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:14,640
link budget if the fact that the how you

318
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,750
add<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a link budget is you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

319
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,800
have gained and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

320
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,320
loss

321
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,609
gain is going to be things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're</font>

322
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have transmitters and receive</font>

323
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:27,300
amplifiers you're going to have antenna

324
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,790
gain loss is things like the path loss

325
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,769
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual signal loss between the</font>

326
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,719
between the receive and the transmit

327
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,990
antennas which is called free space loss

328
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,329
I'm skipping around here I apologize

329
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,490
transmission line loss you're going to

330
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:44,310
have for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> LMR 400 which seems to</font>

331
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">be the standard for a lot of community</font>

332
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:50,040
wireless folks has about<font color="#CCCCCC"> AB DB and a</font>

333
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,380
half of loss per meter at five point a

334
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,699
killer gigahertz so that's something you

335
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to consider as well when you add</font>

336
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:00,149
this all up this is kind of a quick

337
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,860
schematic of what where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain and the</font>

00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">loss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is on these sort of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

339

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rush through here because i</font>

340
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,670
know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes left</font>

341
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,019
here's sort of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of what signal</font>

342
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,449
level looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font>

343
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,410
link from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transmitter side you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to lose a little bit of the</font>

345
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,560
connectors and such you're going to gain

346
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot from the antenna you're going to</font>

347
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,420
lose a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot in the free space gain a</font>

348
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,980
little bit back from the receive antenna

349
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,430
lose a little bit on the on the coax and

350
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,720
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully that received signal is</font>

351
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:32,399
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can be able to decode</font>

352
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,100
that signal let's see here this is how

353
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,630
you add it up there's a little program

354
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
that I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wrote a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel</font>

355
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,990
spreadsheet or you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I a</font>

356
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,100
perl script as well that you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

357
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,959
my site at LNS calm and it's just

358
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,930
basically shows how you can sort of

359
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:50,279
calculate this this is very rudimentary

360
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,199
it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea just sort of give you a</font>

361
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,939
course idea if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

362
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough signal on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other end we</font>

363
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually found that in cranky and the</font>

364
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,540
numbers and there's frequency how much

365
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,760
transmitter output<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to have the</font>

366
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,709
estimated<font color="#E5E5E5"> antenna gain and loss and</font>

367
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,470
things like that that the numbers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

368
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:10,319
got up i got at the end i actually

369
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:13,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">showed up to be what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually got in</font>

370
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,240
real life<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what you're shooting for is</font>

371
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,680
that green number at the bottom there

372
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,440
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called famed margin and that's</font>

373
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,959
the amount of signal above what the

374
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,370
receiver needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to code it and</font>

375
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason you need a little bit of fade</font>

376
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,130
margin and

377
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,810
in longer distance you actually need a

378
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,580
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fade margin is because the</font>

379
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,099
atmospherics are going to bounce that

380
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,090
signal quite a bit up and down depending

381
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:42,930
on you know weather conditions and such

382
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:44,310
so let's see path loss is something

383
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,400
you're going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of like</font>

384
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,550
calculate and model as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well path loss</font>

385
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:53,520
usually have three major sort of factors

386
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,310
to this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is refraction and that's</font>

387
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,319
things like thermal ducting marine

388
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:01,319
evaporation boundary layer and these are

389
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms that basically mean that the</font>

390
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,210
signal will get bent as it goes through

391
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the air and depending on the sort of the</font>

392
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,200
thickness of the air temperature

393
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,850
boundary layers things like that the

394
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,500
signal may not get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

395
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,810
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go auger</font>

396
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,000
into the water or we're actually even

397
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,219
shoot over the island depending on how

398
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,050
much the signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets bent again longer</font>

399
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,210
the path and the more adverse the

400
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">conditions like going over oceans and</font>

401
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,110
things like that the more likely these

<font color="#E5E5E5">things are going to affect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you the way</font>

403
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,730
that you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solve these is either</font>

404
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,770
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up multiple antennas to try to</font>

405
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:38,040
capture the signal on a vertical level

406
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:41,490
or even power through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> by putting like</font>

407
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,170
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> power on either in atmospheric</font>

408
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,360
attenuation is usually like rain or snow

409
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,829
at these frequencies that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> license</font>

410
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,840
frequency is two point four or five

411
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:54,210
point eight it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that much</font>

412
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,580
effect but things like trees and such a

413
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,410
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will design a path so that</font>

414
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,910
they'll they'll put up a path in the

415
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">wintertime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the trees don't have any</font>

416
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,640
leaves in it and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden</font>

417
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,650
the path doesn't work when the trees

418
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,000
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have these because they're</font>

419
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,320
actually containing water in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

420
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,359
leaves and they'll actually attenuate

421
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,669
the other issue is that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,160
going to show some graphics on that and

424
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,300
show you what that what that's all about

425
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Abbotsford calculations where we talked

426
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,050
about rain fade and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,320

428
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of modeling that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AT&T did in</font>

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:32,149
the 50s and such for their long-distance

430
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:34,590
microwave links for and they went out

431
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,910
look to the atmosphere you know weather

432
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,590
conditions things like that try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

433
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,980
predict and try to model this and this

434
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,899
this has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually modeled</font>

435
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,730
computerized modeled at this point and a

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,200
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies like path loss and such</font>

437
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,120
will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this built into their software</font>

438
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,290
you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Radium mobile but</font>

439
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,719
you will find this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the more expensive</font>

440
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,860
software so we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the modeling on this</font>

441
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,390
we figured there was actually going to

446
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,770
reasons why for that it has to do with

447
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,190
marine boundary layer but we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,959
that you have to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protect around</font>

452
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,800
you can see from this graphic and it

459

460

to bounce back into the receive antenna

462
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:48,270
and put signals out of phase is that the

up that's the earth curve her for the

487
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,219

<font color="#E5E5E5">this little bump on the on the far</font>

493
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,010
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to sort of like make sure</font>

494
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,750
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't cause the problems we</font>

495

actually have to go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

496
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,900
what's called a site survey and see if

497
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's not a house or building that's</font>

498
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,050
going to be cutting into that that sits

499
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,910
on top of that fortunately it was kind

500
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,290
of like a forest and such on that top so

501
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:12,210
it wasn't anything that was cutting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

502
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,649
us there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously antenna and</font>

503
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,080
transmission line selection that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

connector what type of coax in the case

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,429
of for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're running into</font>

508
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,809
hospital hostile environments with

509
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,420
seawater and such we have to make sure

510
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,920
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using stuff that's going</font>

511
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,050
to degrade pretty quickly where you have

512
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,970
to use stuff that is going to last for a

513
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,950
couple years and such so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font>

514
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,420
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put like a radome which</font>

515

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,520
the antenna to protect the antenna feed

517
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,320
and such there's electrical

518
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,730
considerations<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

the antenna selection in other words

520
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,090
what's the operating frequency how much

521
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,040
gain is required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the signal to</font>

radiation pattern the radiation pattern

524
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,150
is critical again to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to minimize the</font>

525
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,100
amount of signal that we may be getting

526
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,620
off the side so we don't have

527
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,178
interference or we're not necessarily

528
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,330
blasting somebody else so you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

529
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,800
careful about that with power<font color="#CCCCCC"> captured</font>

using a hundred watch transmitter we

532
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:17,928
want to make sure the antenna doesn't

533
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:22,170
melt off polarization<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is a concern</font>

534
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:25,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">due the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that polarization is used</font>

535
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,990
to prevent multipath so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance if</font>

536
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,330
you're running over a large flat surface

537
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,880
like water which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a horizontal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> surface</font>

538
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,040
you want to consider using an antenna

539
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,860
that's vertically polarized because any

540
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,090
of the reflections are going to be

541
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming back off the water or</font>

542
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,840
horizontally polarized if I use a

543
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,850
vertical polarized antenna I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">be ignoring that multiple it's going to</font>

545
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,530
be attenuating that so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying</font>

00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,120
use a horizontal polarization you can

550
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,770
also there's a concept called circular

551
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,719
polarization which actually solves a lot

552
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,330
of those as well but again we're not

553
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,270

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:32,020
on the on the horizontal man the

563
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:33,970
schematic yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so let's let's look at</font>

564
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,040
some some pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> busy own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OmniGraffle</font>

565
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,620
here so the cloud is obviously of the

566
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,530
intertubes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're from an archive the</font>

567
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,600
city has a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber network with</font>

568
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,550
various rings and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this shows a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

569
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">encapsulated view of that we actually</font>

570
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:51,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">run two links out to the island above</font>

571
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,670
2.4 and 5.8 this is some newer gear

572
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,760
that's actually a 211 and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

573
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,710
about that a few slides here on the

574
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,060
island is kind of interesting so we've

575
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,540
we've actually gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> through I think</font>

576
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:07,780
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four iterations on the</font>

577
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:10,360
network on the island based on different

578
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,149
models of reliability on the links and

579
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,469
what the best mechanism is to failover

580
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,940
we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to minimize dirty tricks</font>

581
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,190
like two or three layers an app that

582
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,080
sort of thing so on the island there

583
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,860
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty standard Cisco</font>

584
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,929
switch that then goes in to a so Chris

585
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,030
board it's a small x86 board as Tim

586
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,860
mentioned and then to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the actual</font>

587
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:33,940
connection from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lighthouse on the</font>

588
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:37,479
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the island down into the</font>

589
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:40,600
buildings<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are staffed there we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

590
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,910
a number of fiber connections so there's

591
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,419
a the antenna going back toward San

592
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:49,030
Francisco we've got the number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

593
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,790
repairs that go to the power or

594
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:55,600
generation room and then over into the

595
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:58,389
living quarters the picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

596
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,889
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top left there is the antennas</font>

597
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,010
that Tim was talking about is you

598
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's as a radome or a plastic</font>

599
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,700
protector in the front we use minimal

600
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,560
amounts of coax so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing longer</font>

601
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,580
than about three or four feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> of coax</font>

602
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes into these small embedded</font>

603
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,550
boards and

604
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,500
powered by power ethernet the idea here

605
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,510
is to minimize the amount of coax as

606
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,240
much as possible for a variety of

607
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:25,160
reasons one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the big ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the the</font>

608
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,540
loss of signal as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim was talking about</font>

609
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:33,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also coax is very difficult to</font>

610
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle it's not something like rj45 or</font>

611
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:40,250
you can crimp in and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 seconds</font>

612
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:42,260
blindfolded LMR and radio<font color="#CCCCCC"> acts and some</font>

613
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,870
of the Andrew cables extremely difficult

614
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,610
to prepare and so we wanted to have

615
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,760
cables that were short were they when it

616
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,709
gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> talks and rather they would get</font>

617
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,610
taught and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get move by</font>

618
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:58,220
personnel in the lighthouse so here's a

619
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,350
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the equipment this is</font>

620
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,630
probably the third or four foot box we

621
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,459
put up there unfortunately due to the

622
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,160
logistics of the island we generally get

623
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,990
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 12 hours notice when there's</font>

624
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,110
going to be a boat right out there so

625
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:14,690
this is my third backup weatherproof

626
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,879
case this is a small fiberglass case

627
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,320
made by a company called Stalin it's

628
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,120
generally used for enclosures and

629
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,370
factory lines that sort of thing and

630
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,959
this was my example case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

631
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,699
presentation so that's why you can see

632
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,960
the clear window it's not really

633
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,360
designed to go out there but we did it

634
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyways you can see there's there's two</font>

635
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,959
radios in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a small bullet one is</font>

636
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,510
the 2.4 gigahertz radio and then the

637
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,050
small rectangle one in the back is the

638
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:45,530
rocket radio which is a 5.8 gigahertz we

639
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,270
then use outdoor Ethernet and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

640
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:52,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of weatherproof connectors between the</font>

641
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:55,160
box so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside world inside us</font>

642
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,690
pretty messy again when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

643
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the island there's very mental amounts</font>

644
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,490
of notice to get there as you saw from

645
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,620
the pictures it's it's at least an hour

646
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,720
and a half process to get off the boat

647
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,030
unload all the equipment get up to the

648
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the lighthouse so generally an</font>

649
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,410
average we've gotten three hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

650
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,970
window and that's a complete 12 hour a

651
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,370
day so we get about three hours of

652
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual time to do work so this is not</font>

653
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">very pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly dirty but</font>

654
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,730
what you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's a to media</font>

655
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,770
converters up at the top there

656
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,419
again as Tim mentioned powers of

657
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,150
concerns these are just hundred mega did

658
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:32,600
you know trendnet specials nothing fancy

659
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:36,950
this low power the cisco switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> against</font>

660
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,510
the 2950 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> port so Chris board and a</font>

661
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,440
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wall warts and power strips</font>

662
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:44,330
that then again comes down into the the

663
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,340
staff house and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

664
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,340
cleaner again you see the media

665
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:52,070
converters they're a small

666
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:56,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">energy-efficient switch they have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HEA</font>

667
00:26:52,070 --> 00:27:00,110
adapter and then Wi-Fi within the living

668
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,668
quarters they're a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail</font>

669
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the kit that's what they call it</font>

670
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">from Europe they call these things kits</font>

671
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,668
i'm not sure why but basically the kid

672
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,530
is comprised of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two radios that we</font>

673
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,990
talked about really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice thing about</font>

674
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,809
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggity gear is that it's a standard</font>

675
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,940
Linux image that's accessible to you so

676
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:18,440
unlike mikrotik and other vendors that

677
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,600
are based off a linux and completely

678
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,919
hide that fact the nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about the</font>

679
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,020
iniquity<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gary's you can get a shell on</font>

680
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you can add additional packages you</font>

681
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,610
can tweak it if you think you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

682
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">better driver you can deploy it on there</font>

683
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,870
so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really nice equipment and</font>

684
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,650
it's extremely affordable you're looking

685
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:38,959
at under a hundred dollars per radio the

686
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:42,140
standard is n connector for most of

687
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,720
these radios on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5.8 they actually</font>

688
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,840
since it's a dual polarize we have two

689
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,910
different polarities on a single antenna

690
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,030
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually use two different antenna</font>

691
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:55,970
connectors on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the radio as mentioned</font>

692
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,190
these rh11 and based this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre</font>

693
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,230
standard so it works really good with

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,210
other a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bic whaty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gear and does it</font>

695
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,090
really interoperate with other<font color="#CCCCCC"> h11 end</font>

696
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:07,190
gear such as cisco one of the things

697
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely buy you on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless space versus VoIP phones is</font>

699
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:16,790
the pua is never really standardized

700
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:20,659
we've seen the voltages very you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">easily so these are kind of like a set</font>

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,420
like a path MTU problem so it's

important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you you know all the</font>

one is actually have techies by the

cabling

821
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:05,039
we we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this outdoor ethernet cable</font>

00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:07,259
and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fit in any of the jack</font>

823
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,658
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually took seven different</font>

825
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,429
would actually fit this cable it's also

826
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:15,748
very sticky so you're you're out there

and the weather trying to crimp this

828

cable that's that's really sticky and

829
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:22,289
it's a huge mess it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very dirty out</font>

00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:24,749
there so you know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> your clothes are</font>

00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,119
reductions that we like to look at is

836
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:34,918

00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:52,079
resolution more bandwidth would be great

845
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:55,169
so we're looking at running links from

846
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,299
different facilities on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mainland</font>

847
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:00,449
potentially other sites in San Francisco

848
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:03,299
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> north and Marin another great thing</font>

849
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:05,999
we'd love to do is put a non Island sort

850
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:07,469
of visual display for the scientist

851
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:13,529
ability bug when there's network

852
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:14,849
problems that's it questions thanks I

853
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:17,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean if you could see the bird we</font>

854
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:24,750
supplied to in hats for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the birds there</font>

855
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:27,659
so you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta great Jay Hanigan</font>

856
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,609
with impulse you mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she used</font>

857
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,399
a both horizontal and vertical

858
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:34,109
polarization like a 5.8 like

859
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:35,819
simultaneously is that for diversity or

860
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:38,038
is it for additional bandwidth or or

861
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:40,079
what's the what's the rationale behind

862
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:43,049
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> both the vertical and horizontal</font>

863
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,039
polarization on that radio since there's

864
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:50,129
two chains on the 5.8 radios we wanted

865
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,079
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so the only way to do</font>

866
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:54,029
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with doing with one antenna is</font>

867
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,849
having either split between horizontal

868
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:58,440
vertical polarizations this just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives</font>

869
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:00,299
us a little bit more reliability gets

870
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,490
this about another 3d be worth a signal

871
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">or fade margin on it and actually more</font>

872
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:07,919
speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same frequency yeah its</font>

873
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,260
exact same frequency

874
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,450
aunt acapella five nines data cool

875
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,460
slides like<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless like that stuff oh</font>

876
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,250
I do have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question what was the final</font>

877
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,630
power draw what was the total budget you

878
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,220
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred watts to work with but</font>

879
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,540
what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get it down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to or what did</font>

880
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,040
it end up that I think it's evolving

881
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,290
around 50 watts probably the cisco

882
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,700
switch takes up most of it the radios

883
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,070
are probably like two to three wats

884
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,680
something like that the circus boards

885
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,030
like five watts like that we know we

886
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,230
didn't go over budget because we didn't

887
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:40,330
rip any breakers we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't carry the</font>

888
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,730
water<font color="#CCCCCC"> bead around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tony sorry hi</font>

889
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:46,090
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and the other question</font>

890
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked you was other any other systems</font>

891
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that aren't like like 11 based better</font>

892
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:53,709
this low power like the you know

893
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,290
synchronous<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote-unquote TDM legacy</font>

894
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,660
systems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see out there for people</font>

895
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,790
doing you know and by t1 that kind of

896
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,990
stuff point-to-point license radios that

897
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,120
kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> righty that's tough</font>

898
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,279
appropriate at this point it would be if

899
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,290
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afford it dragonwave makes some</font>

900
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,390
really nice carrier-class radios out

901
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,640
there that that we could actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> push</font>

902
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,500
more bandwidth with but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

903
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,259
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about tens of thousands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

904
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollars if not more and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last point I</font>

905
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,350
did miss it but what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final</font>

906
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,020
performance figure like what were you

907
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:25,120
guys seen for transfer delay all that

908
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:27,850
kind of stuff um we could actually

909
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,650
probably do what's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> MCS you know</font>

910
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:32,490
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 or we could probably do the</font>

911
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:35,860
fastest rate but I've locked it down to

912
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:38,169
mcs<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 which i think is like 12 mega bits</font>

913
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,430
or so on the thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the latency</font>

914
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,580
i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what the latency is</font>

915
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,919
relatively low low so they're happy yeah

916
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,990
oh yeah no there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect there</font>

917
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,610
they've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world cup out</font>

918
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,919
there there you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

919
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,720

920
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,010
hulu all those sort of things as well as

921
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,240
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a voice line having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a real</font>

922
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,620
telephone out there and supposed to

923
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,330
having to use you know two-way radios

924
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,250
and such so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're right up</font>

925
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,220
there with the 20th century<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they</font>

926
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,650
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> start hearing on the island oh</font>

927
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,970
yeah we're putting an IX out there yeah

928
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,080
and as you could expect Tony one of

929
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,899
things that's really interesting about

930
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the RF situation going from the mainland</font>

931
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,220
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the island it's very fast on the</font>

932
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,690
download content there's no congestion

933
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,100
going that way because there's no one to

934
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,070
compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> with there's not a lot of links</font>

935
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is out</font>

936
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,940
but going back the other way around is

937
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,890
certainly challenging so for them it's a

938
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,480
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience but getting data out</font>

939
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,670
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenging for us so we only</font>

940
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a couple megabits out but plenty</font>

941
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,260
coming down I've seen up to 15 to 20

942
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:37,400
megabits coming down oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so as soon</font>

943
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">as the is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bergkamp active think</font>

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,620
you're being asked to sit down town

945
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:43,850
alright see ya thank you fortunately we

946
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,940
had too many slides on this thing I

947
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,960
apologize I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> soft line okay I was</font>

948
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering you said the uptime</font>

949
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,350
wasn't quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> done you done twenty-eight</font>

950
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,090
percent you bring it oh I alluded to

951
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I didn't touch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running</font>

952
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,540
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's called so this is a critical</font>

953
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,900
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will make this the last one</font>

954
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,100
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> into what's called marine</font>

955
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,950
evaporation boundary layer and what

956
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,630
happens is most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the days in San</font>

957
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,569
Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually windy there's fog</font>

958
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:10,460
things like that on those about a week

959
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,830
out of the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get absolutely</font>

960
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,990
still air and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a really nice</font>

961
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,850
sunny day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that means is they'll</font>

962
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,399
really sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cold air above the ocean</font>

963
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,830
but right above the ocean for like about

964
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,300
a you know if you know 30 meters or

965
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:26,150
something like that you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a whole</font>

966
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of evaporation coming off the</font>

967
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,990
ocean such so you have this sort of

968
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,700
boundary between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two and they</font>

969
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually will bend the signal down and</font>

970
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,390
so those days we don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

971
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,650
connection to the island I was going

972
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">across the Golden Gate Bridge and I</font>

973
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,130
looked over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right I could see the</font>

974
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,169
islands that I'd see a mirror image of

975
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:44,120
the island right underneath it I could

976
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,050
say ah it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those days that we're</font>

977
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,609
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get a signal out there I</font>

978
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,020
called them up and or a call at the

979
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:50,480
academy I said are you getting the

980
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,759
camera they said no and I said I can see

981
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,770
it because optically it's it's actually

982
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,030
bending the signal out there yeah now

983
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,100
the follow up on that point we actually

984
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:01,120
graph signal and whether there's a
