00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,520
got half our lightning

00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:28,360
our first lightning talk presenter

andreia<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phillip from Caesar neck</font>

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:53,420
thank you why are the slides not bearing

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:53,420
on the big screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there</font>

10
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,920
thank you very much my name is Sanjay

11
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Philippe i'm working at seasoning which</font>

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,780
is the top level domain registry of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,580
czech republic for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who don't know</font>

14
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,770
czech republic is a small country<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,020
Central Europe it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 10 million</font>

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:25,350
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the best beer in the world so</font>

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,390
it is said something funny so the main

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,199
news from my presentation I would like

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:34,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we have currently or</font>

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,789
almost 100,000 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Essex and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zones in you</font>

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,720
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> two level domain which is</font>

22
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely that the highest number in</font>

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,190
the world but probably in more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

24
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,549
all the other top-level domains in total

25
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,220
and the rest of the presentation would

26
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,270
be how we get to those numbers what we

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,780
did to just be the startup<font color="#E5E5E5"> Regina second</font>

28
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,179
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> no country so basically well before</font>

29
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">we started deploying DNS SEC we we had a</font>

30
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:05,280
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> complaints and and reasons why</font>

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,038
not to go like that there is no business

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">case that registrarse region and one kid</font>

33
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,040
the same for registrant's that it's too

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,480
expensive it's too complicated and

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,879
everybody pointed us to some chicken<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,030
egg problem that there's no market and

37
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,739
things like that and we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

38
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,950
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things hbu couldn't</font>

39
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,510
charge it up so we took it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a little</font>

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,390
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a different point of view we</font>

41
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,480
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody must do it if we</font>

42
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to employ it and we also thought</font>

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,379
about the fact that some people wants to

44
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,829
start on a special service so with that

45
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,480
we thought while we security is probably

46
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,409
not a special service we believe that

47
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,299
security is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feature and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we sell</font>

48
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:51,390
domains it should be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural part of</font>

49
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,860
domains and that it's all responsibility

50
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,958
because we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the only one in</font>

51
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">the game that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could they have power to</font>

52
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,980
to study about that we couldn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

53
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,069
alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,530
they need to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> some allies far guys</font>

55
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:09,399
peace<font color="#CCCCCC"> registrar's content providers and</font>

56
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:13,239
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> also an uses the registrar's</font>

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,390
are of course the most important you

58
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:21,099
know entities in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chain</font>

59
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:24,399
so we focus our communication on them we

60
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:27,730
had several religious Charles and SF so

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,159
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different seminars and before</font>

62
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,798
and after gns large we did a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

63
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,379
training we provide free training how to

64
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,010
work with unison how to how to sign

65
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:41,798
domains we also set up quite nice

66
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,390
conditions for for the NSA we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

67
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">want any fee nothing like that</font>

68
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:51,129
everything is free and we made our two

69
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:54,069
things to make the situation sweeter for

70
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:56,170
them first of all we have a positive

71
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,260
discrimination you know co marketing

72
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,559
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will explain it a bit later</font>

73
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:06,328
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did some technical things to</font>

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,480
help the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Baloch GS record registration</font>

75
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,150
basically this this is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see it on</font>

76
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,010
the screen so how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

77
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,978
the main there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually written that</font>

78
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,409
somebody is registrant that could be

79
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:23,050
some administrative contacts and the

80
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,330
classical EPP structure there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

81
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,180
technical contact and and suffer and a

82
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,430
list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> named service we a little bit</font>

83
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">change it scheme so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> domain is</font>

84
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,590
doesn't include list of names but it

85
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:39,070
points to a structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> called in the NSF</font>

86
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,650
and this structure includes name service

87
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:45,010
and technical contacts what does good

88
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:47,138
for its good for bulk registration if

89
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,750
you have thousand domains I'll and all

90
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,940
of them have the same name servers you

91
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,919
don't have to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> like frozen objects</font>

92
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,560
in our database but you just create one

93
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,880
and you point all domains to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> object</font>

94
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,949
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to change those</font>

95
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,010
nameservers you just do a one single

96
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:06,400
operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce that philosophy</font>

97
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,500
also to a another<font color="#E5E5E5"> object called Kisa</font>

98
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,310
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vs record it's a it's a key</font>

99
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,370
set and this key set can also have

100
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,310
include several<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS keys and several</font>

101
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,889
technical contacts so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we generate the</font>

102
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,370
zone file we compute those DS records

103
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:28,040
instead of the domain name technical

104
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,560
contact and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can have a million</font>

105
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,570
of domains and you can have just single

106
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,000
key that signs all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

107
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,280
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a key role over you just</font>

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,470
change one single item in our database

109
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,539
and you can basically do it and you can

110
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,280
do all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other work on the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

111
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,979
so it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already helped them</font>

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,979
technically to do the bulk<font color="#E5E5E5"> GS record</font>

113
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:52,729
registration in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car marketing we</font>

114
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:55,729
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the register bonds to</font>

115
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:58,370
market domains he's so brave enough to

116
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:01,010
do so let me pay one-half of the of the

117
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,260
campaign and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maximum limit of the</font>

118
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:06,409
campaign is based on registrar

119
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,500
performance so to help them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to promote</font>

120
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:12,650
the NSA we allow to increase that limit

121
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,810
if they if they have a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

122
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:19,429
genetic registrations and bonus for

123
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">genus sign zones and surprisingly even</font>

124
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,080
in during 2009 some some register

125
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,450
started campaign that were focused and

126
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,030
Gina say that are explaining the DNS

127
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:32,090
against important and people should

128
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:35,799
should want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll we also try to</font>

129
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:40,760
communicate with with end users we were

130
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,860
know how we had a lot of conferences and

131
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,400
some sort of marketing communication

132
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:50,360
with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end users we put a lot of</font>

133
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,710
article into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the newspapers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing</font>

141
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:13,020
got a lot of media attention so people

142
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:18,710
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something can can be improved</font>

try it here if you want it's a basically

149
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,690
tool that tests your DNS resolvers that

150
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,719
should be probably on your for example a

152

know they're happy to extend this

165

project but you know some Americans

166
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,690
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can leave it English</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">changes another another tool people</font>

168
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:33,419
likes is a DNS SEC why later it's a

169
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,370
firefox add-on we had a problem that we

170
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,478
couldn't visualize DNS SEC for normal

171
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,030
people if you a sign the domains nothing

172
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,860
happens it's not visible<font color="#E5E5E5"> because those</font>

173
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,170
people do not understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so they</font>

174
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,870
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see somehow that they have</font>

175
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,589
signed domains and everything is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

176
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:57,030
we did this firefox add-on which looks

177
00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,200
similar like a https in firefox if you

178
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,199
install this plugin

179
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,180
and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> genus domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is designed if you</font>

180
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,150
it will show a key and the color of the

evening is over whether the domain is

186

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:34,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">very nice to learn it's really handy for</font>

190
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:37,010
for people that want to see DNS SEC and

191
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,920
it's very hard to do so its own DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

violated<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's easy or just type gianna</font>

of downloads it's really popular torrent

198
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,960
so I didn't describe everything I'll be

199
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,620
we put a lot of energy into promoting d

200
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,020
in a second we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in September 2008</font>

201
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:08,240
and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers of genus</font>

202
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:11,900
exciting domains just slightly go at the

203
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,330
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the 2009 we have about 115</font>

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:19,610
hundreds<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign zone that's really nothing</font>

205
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:23,150
very impressive but next year the

206
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:26,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation changed dramatically as you</font>

207
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:30,380
can see there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two big steps that</font>

208
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:33,620
really changed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers dramatically</font>

209
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,920
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened to big reduced charges</font>

210
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,930
enable DNS SEC by default for all the

211
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,270
mains they are hosting on a DNS servers

212
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,969
they do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> charge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any additional fee</font>

213
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:49,189
although before they try to but now they

214
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:51,220
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it free and they felt that they</font>

215
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,060
could get some marketing advantage

216
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,390
surprisingly this was very well

217
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,880
communicated in the media mainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

218
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,770
many of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> magazines hatch domains are</font>

219
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,990
on the name servers of those switches to

220
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,120
us so they knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something happened</font>

221
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,160
and they they knew it's probably good so

222
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,190
they wrote some articles that some

223
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,400
security

224
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:14,160
improved on the magazines and so on and

225
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,650
really the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> share of those rich is</font>

226
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">just it's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good and they are</font>

227
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:24,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely not losing so it helped a lot</font>

228
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:26,910
and we are actually at the end so just I

229
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,949
want you to show you example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SEC</font>

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,620

231
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:36,630
really not so complicated although we

232
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,970
the registry has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to started out we are</font>

233
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,460
premiering this thing so we found some

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,140
bags<font color="#E5E5E5"> and small problems in currently in</font>

235
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,570
a second limitation but we are fixing

236
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to you will probably not see it if</font>

237
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,640
you will do it there for example some

for the NSA can be found that there are

246
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,870
some boxing implementation and so on but

247
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,990
anyway those things are fixed and and we

248
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:19,650
are on the right track so czech republic

more news to come we are now use against

253
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,880
it because we started very early in 2008

little bit about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gianna skirt versus DNS</font>

287
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,710
SEC I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us know what DNS</font>

288
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,959
SEC is obviously we just how to talk

289
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,880
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it not everyone knows what dns</font>

290
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,720
curve is not everyone knows there's kind

291
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,260
of an argument that's raging on anywhere

292
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,670
between one to two mailing lists

293
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,180
occasionally flares up about DNS curve

294
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,589
versus DNS SEC there's an interesting

295
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,420
point of view that sometimes comes up

296
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,890
which says that we instead of deploying

297
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:48,569
DNS SEC we should deploy DNS curve so

298
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,880
not everyone may know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this some</font>

299
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">people may to those of us who have our</font>

301
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,189
the difference is pretty well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

302
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,480
everyone in your organization may

309
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,180

318
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,770
analogies and I like to argue so

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,910
argument by analogy is kind of a nice

320
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,319
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me what when you talk about</font>

321
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,550
argument by analogy there is actually a

322
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,340
whole sort of school of thought on this

323
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,079
and the way you do it is to really try

324
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:54,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit more systematic in</font>

325
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:57,690
the analogies you choose and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in the</font>

326
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,030
in the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you present the analogy</font>

327
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you don't simply say things like DNS</font>

328
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,970
is a stage and all the queries or

329
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,290
players or something like that you try

330
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a little a little more careful</font>

331
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,260
than that so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to present an</font>

332
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,720
analogy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know kind of give some</font>

333
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,340
some try to use the analogy to kind of

334
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,690
bring out some of the different key

335
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,699
features and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the conclusions</font>

336
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,220
that we come to

337
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:22,169
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might mention the word isomorphism</font>

338
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,939
I might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just simply means</font>

339
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:25,829
that it's the components<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the analogy</font>

340
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:28,529
that map to the thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world</font>

341
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:31,229
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the example that I gave of</font>

342
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,480
analogy where you take a free market is

343
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,709
similar to international politics in

344
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,419
this Kim that same example then a firm

345
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:42,349
would be country countries will be like

346
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:45,329
firms interacting in the market so I

347
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,709
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for reference we're going to</font>

348
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,209
talk a little bit about what you know

349
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,638
how DNS SEC is defined I think we all

350
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what DNS SEC is DNS SEC provides</font>

351
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,829
digital signatures using that kind of

352
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:58,529
cryptography it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

353
00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:01,349
validate the DNS responses that they're

354
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:03,600
receiving at their resolvers DNS curve

355
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,970
actually provides something<font color="#E5E5E5"> different it</font>

356
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,829
provides link layer security or

357
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,350
transport layer security if you will of

358
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,599
DNS responses and it actually encrypts

359
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:17,908
them in ways that make<font color="#CCCCCC"> them difficult to</font>

360
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:21,869
be eavesdropping upon so here's the

361
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:24,269
analogy in a DNS SEC world the analogy

362
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:27,239
goes something like this I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

363
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">write a memo and send it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my colleague</font>

364
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,360
mark at UC Santa Cruz so I write the

365
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,000
memo I use the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of indelible ink so</font>

366
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,939
it can't be erased or altered in any way

367
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,889
and then I sign it I sign it with the

368
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,830
signature<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very very very difficult</font>

369
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:46,049
to to forge so just imagine me signing

370
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,029
it with a pen with maybe one of those

371
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:50,779
big magic markers that really smells

372
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:55,500
like ether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of nice to inhale</font>

373
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:57,929
so I do that and then I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand the</font>

374
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,029
memo to my<font color="#CCCCCC"> secretary now of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

375
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:03,000
is a very contrived analogy because I

376
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:05,610
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a secretary and I don't think</font>

377
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,519
mark does either so but my secretary

378
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,408
then takes the memo and hands it to a

379
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,330
courier who then maybe hands it to

380
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:14,909
another courier and then it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

381
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,889
marks secretary and watch secretary

382
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:18,990
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to him he can then look at the</font>

383
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:20,340
memo he can see my signature he knows

384
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it hasn't been altered in any way</font>

385
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,959
the memo has not been added to it hasn't

386
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">been subtracted from it hasn't been</font>

387
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,330
changed in any way so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the DNS</font>

388
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:33,250
SEC memo works

389
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,870
the DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> curve memo is a little bit</font>

390
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,120
different I write the memo but I don't

391
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,678
actually bother to sign it instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

392
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,820
I do is I fold it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take it and</font>

393
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,350
put it in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those security</font>

394
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,809
envelopes with a little design<font color="#CCCCCC"> art that</font>

395
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,928
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I sign</font>

396
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:49,450
across the seal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> envelope so</font>

397
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,800
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows that the envelope or at</font>

398
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,710
least the person receives the envelope

399
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,780
knows that the envelope was mine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

400
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,720
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the envelope then I hand it to</font>

401
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,809
my secretary who opens the envelope

402
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,900
discards it takes the memo puts it in a

403
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,850
new envelope that he then signs across

404
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,460
the seal and then hands it to the

405
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:12,459
courier who opens the envelope discards

406
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,030
it takes the unsigned memo and puts it

407
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:18,160
into it and a envelope that she then

408
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,800
signs across the seal then he hands it

409
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,950
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mark's secretary who opens the</font>

410
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,290
envelope discards it and then signs

411
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,090
across the seal again and so on then

412
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,950
that gets handed to mark who then opens

413
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,449
looks at the signature and says oh yes

414
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,790
my secretary didn't thought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send this</font>

415
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,010
to me and opens up the envelope<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

416
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,649
looks at the memo and reads it and does

417
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:42,490
whatever needs to be done so the

418
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:44,530
difference is is in the case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMS suck</font>

419
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,750
the memo<font color="#E5E5E5"> is signed and you can actually</font>

420
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,720
validate the memo is actually authentic

421
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,280
in the case of DNS curve if you can't

422
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,929
validate the memos authentic<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at</font>

423
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,840
least you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nobody you can</font>

424
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,550
validate that that it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your</font>

425
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,080
secretary and that nobody saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

426
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,059
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the Secretary was bringing it</font>

427
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,980
in nobody was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see what the memo</font>

428
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:05,110
had on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it whereas in the DNS sack memo</font>

429
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,260
the men was just being handed to people

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:19,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about this particular analogy for</font>

433
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,309
about two seconds one of the interesting

isomorphisms that comes out one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

435
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:25,120
first things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to ask is why</font>

436
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,070
can't I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sign the memo like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did in</font>

437
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,649
DNS SEC and put it in the security

438
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,309
envelope and there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason you</font>

439
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,429
can't do that and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact in DNS SEC and</font>

440
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:38,160
DNS curve there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

441
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:40,990
you can't implement both

442
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,179
so when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> start arguing about this</font>

443
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,950
and start saying things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

444
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:46,750
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Deanna you can't do them both or you</font>

445
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,150
shouldn't do them both you should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

446
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,720
curve instead of DNS SEC it turns out

447
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,660
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like saying you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

448
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,470
run windows seven instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> using high</font>

450
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,690
and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit contrived</font>

451
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,160
obviously but for some people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

452
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,059
they obviously they solve different

453
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,740
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some people who may</font>

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,450
right tools for the task for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

458
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,440
personally I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have much interest in</font>

459
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:23,830
my DNS data being non eavesdropped upon

460
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,360
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns as the phone book and so</font>

461
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,159
it's sort of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

462
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,590
encrypt the phone book it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

463
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,240
not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that important to me so I think</font>

464
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that what we are looking at actually as</font>

465
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,780
the first slide as the title slide

466
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,610
implies with the Apple and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the orange</font>

467
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,870
this is a false dichotomy this is really

468
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,000
an argument that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to happen</font>

469
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,620
anymore well we should basically just do

470
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,420
is finish standardizing what needs to be

471
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,010
standardized let the implementers

472
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,320
implement what they want and let the ops

473
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:51,970
guy is deploy what they want and move on

474
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have the analogy sort of written up at</font>

475
00:21:51,970 --> 00:22:00,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that URL and that's it so if there any</font>

476
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,670
questions and we do have telling for

477
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:02,670
questions

478
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,560
great so then everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else thinks the</font>

479
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,390
arguments stupid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll agree with me</font>

480
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:17,540
thanks if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions Thank</font>

481
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:19,940
managers and a final lightning talk for

482
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:24,260
this right write anything down I'm

483

<font color="#E5E5E5">having a really bad week on some eyes is</font>

486
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:54,649
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a five ok ok so I'm Todd Underwood</font>

487
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:58,520
and I am NOT representing any company

488
00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:00,770
for the purposes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the suggestion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

489
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,600
I'm about to make so please do not

490
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,220
discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one if any pass or</font>

491
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,919
prospective employers or current

492
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,280
employers thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much so this</font>

493
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,360
talk is entitled prefixes as

494
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,760
probabilities and it is a modest

495
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,240
proposal to radically extend the useful

496
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,170
life of ipv4 so here's the problem as we

497
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,550
know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm going to talk fast</font>

498
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:23,420
because I would imagine there will be a

499
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,950
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of throwing of fruit or</font>

500
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,600
kvetching at the end we're just

501
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,130
conventional<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just like when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you catch</font>

502
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,870
by just mentioning something you're

503
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,240
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here's the</font>

504
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem as we know it everybody knows v4</font>

505
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,840
prefix face is running out ipv6 in spite

506
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,610
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martin leave you will tell you</font>

507
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,320
is not operationally equivalent to v4

508
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,149
yet now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

509
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,100
hard work and I fast v6 for many many

510
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,230
times publicly in the past and it's

511
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,060
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but no one saying thinks</font>

512
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,680
that this transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going smoothly</font>

513
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,159
well or<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's all going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be ready</font>

514
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,450
by the time things start getting bad

515
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,190
time is running out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there are any</font>

516
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,740
mechanisms to usefully extend the life

517
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,180
of v4 we should do those people have

518
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,900
looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of these right so</font>

519
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,950
address market in trading the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

520
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">anti-capitalist anti libertarians have</font>

521
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,950
had a field day with that but the

522
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,480
reality is Jeff Houston presents some

523
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,390
great numbers on the way in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

524
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,520
can extend things by slowly raising the

525
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,890
cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the remaining v4 space and</font>

526
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,539
underutilized vport space to pay for

527
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,369
transition and justify transition

528
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:22,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">v6 so we're looking at that there's</font>

529
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:25,668
rationing or just flat-out running out

530
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:28,190
and being done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so how does resource</font>

531
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:30,769
allocation work now this is a you know

532
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,909
fifty thousand meter perspective from

533
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,200
somebody who's not very great and

534
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,749
doesn't understand the policy process

535
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,200
very well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> re ours allocate resources</font>

536
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:40,639
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 01 scale it's entirely</font>

537
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,499
stochastically divided you either do or

538
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:44,418
do not get an address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else</font>

539
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:46,489
either does or does not get it in the

00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:48,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">normal case an address is allocated to</font>

541
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:50,599
your organization I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak about</font>

542
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:54,139
addresses but mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I think</font>

543
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:56,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 32bit a SMS nicely solve the</font>

00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:58,189
problems for other that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mean other</font>

545
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:59,570
number resource so mostly we're talking

546
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,399
about prefixes although I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

547
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,960
idea extends to any other finite

548
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,369
resource that might be running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

549
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,289
mostly we're talking about prefixes you

550
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:09,168
so the odds that someone else has been

551
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:10,639
allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resource that you've been</font>

552
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:12,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">handed or very very low now there are</font>

553
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:14,330
some interesting cases recently where

554
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:17,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations ended up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same asn</font>

555
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,639
and early early on in my career I may

556
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:21,559
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done some network support for a</font>

557
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:24,738
large-scale power utility and they had a

558
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,539
/ 24 legacy legacy / 24 allocated and

559
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:28,309
they started running out of space<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

560
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:30,950
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept going they just kept</font>

561
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:32,389
going and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed it to a / 23 on</font>

562
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,799
their routers and they just kept going

563
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:37,039
and then they ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of that and so</font>

564
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,769
they changed it to a / 22 and about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7</font>

565
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,970
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> later they called us up because we</font>

00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:43,249
were their service<font color="#CCCCCC"> providing they said</font>

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,899
we can't get to this power broker

568
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:46,129
something in Tennessee d i was living in

569
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:47,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">New Mexico so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

570
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:49,459
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just fine and</font>

571
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:51,408
it took a little while because the idea

572
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">that maybe they had just used more</font>

573
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:55,279
addresses that were close to the

574
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,689
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were theirs had never</font>

575
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,580
occurred to any of us it just seemed

576
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,539
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> such an appalling bizarre idea yep</font>

577
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,820
that's what they had done and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd</font>

578
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:03,739
been doing it for seven years and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

579
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,059
honest I don't know whether they're

580
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:06,349
still doing it because here's how they

581
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,639
solved this problem the main problem was

582
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:08,658
they couldn't nail these guys and they

583
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:10,609
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buying some</font>

584
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:13,190
consulting services from them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

585
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:15,199
what they did is they unallocated the /

586
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:18,019
32 that was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> company's mail server</font>

587
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,389
and set up a static pointing to us for

588
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:22,389
that and kept going

589
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:27,989
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ways to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solve these</font>

590
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:30,329
problems ladies and gentlemen so the

591
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:32,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">disadvantage of this strategy that we</font>

592
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:34,950
have now it's extremely discreet yes or

593
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:37,349
no and requires all manner of external

594
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,779
factors in order to tune the allocation

595
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:41,369
depletion rate so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Erin people</font>

596
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:43,259
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> write talk a lot about how can we</font>

597
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:45,509
slow down the rate of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font>

598
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:47,399
raise the cost to raise the hassle of

599
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:50,070
this stuff going<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we have a more</font>

600
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,589
graceful degradation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the market</font>

601
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">or transfer policy does some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

602
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:56,609
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest I mean this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not to diss</font>

603
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,200
any of the organizations like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin</font>

604
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:00,749
that have implemented this but has a

605
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,489
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very high transactional friction</font>

606
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:04,709
this is not like OD ban by something

607
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:06,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is what people really want so</font>

608
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:09,479
here's the thought experiment allocate

609
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:11,309
truly unique and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know unique just</font>

610
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:12,869
means unique but for emphasis sometimes

611
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:14,700
i'm going to say very unique or truly

612
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:17,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique just to piss off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the grammarians</font>

613
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,859
in the crowd so allocate extremely quite

614
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:22,199
unique addresses to people who really

615
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:25,259
need them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge an insane premium</font>

616
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,909
for them and massively discount

617
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:28,679
addresses that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to</font>

618
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:30,419
consider being multiplied allocated

619
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,639
according to a probabilistic function in

620
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,190
other words explore the probability

621
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:36,899
space that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely empty between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

622
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">and 1 in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the address allocation scheme</font>

623
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:41,908
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a continuous space now we can</font>

624
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,159
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of simple ways to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it in</font>

625
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:46,049
terms of some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> might hang</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out in a</font>

626
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,700
twenty percent or fifty percent or zero

627
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:49,349
percent but in reality this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

628
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,359
continuous space and it lends itself to

629
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:53,369
all kinds of market mechanisms so what

630
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,109
are the advantages this will massively

631
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:57,359
extend the lifetime of v4 space by

632
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:59,489
permit permitting multiplicative reuse

633
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,379
of the remaining resources to the extent

634
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:03,419
to which<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can allocate the same prefix</font>

635
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:05,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten times or a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times or a</font>

636
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,690
thousand times we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

637
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:07,859
get some amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifetime out of that</font>

638
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,849
and I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some modeling that I'm</font>

639
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:10,708
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show that it's a lightning talk</font>

640
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:12,599
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very early work and a lot more</font>

641
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:14,279
thinking needs to be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this it</font>

642
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:17,389
creates the possibilities of a fantastic

643
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:21,929
derivatives market it makes it really

644
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:24,208
useful right to it makes it useful to it

645
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:26,249
so there's dirty space right Vince did a

646
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:28,409
great presentation on we want to reuse

647
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:30,119
this space but it can't be reused cuz

648
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,769
some router can't use it or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

649
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:33,418
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to carry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it well don't let</font>

650
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:34,440
those people carry it let someone else

651
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,539
carry a who is

652
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,129
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to carry that one /a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

653
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:40,049
saw presentations on that it's dirty

654
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:41,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's imperfect nobody likes it blah blah</font>

655
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:44,460
blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what if somebody's willing to</font>

656
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:47,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">take it what if like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000 organizations</font>

657
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,750
are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it okay space</font>

658
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,580
expansion<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> substantial so</font>

659
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">modeling the space advantage I'm not</font>

660
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,918
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present real equations here</font>

661
00:28:51,750 --> 00:29:01,289
because it's a lightning talk and this

662
00:28:52,919 --> 00:29:04,919
is early work but if you consider see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

663
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:06,750
knew I'd get laughed out of Nana if you

664
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,399
consider CR to be the counter we use

665
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,679
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk not just about a</font>

666
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,570
collision but in operationally the

667
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,460
operational overhead of our prefix how

668
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,710
much work do you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a</font>

669
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,120
prefix usable because that's an entire

670
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,529
space of work it could be a single

671
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">collision that prevents your customers</font>

672
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,919
from using it or it could be a variety

673
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">of other functions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how much work</font>

674
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,669
you need to do to route it and we're at

675
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,649
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the association domain for prefix</font>

676
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:30,509
this is the likelihood this is a way of

677
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:33,719
representing the likelihood that that

678
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:35,850
prefix will be an operationally conflict

679
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,320
with some other use of that prefix so

680
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,449
the probability of the operational

681
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,009
overhead of a prefix being positive is

682
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,139
obviously some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> function of the</font>

683
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:46,559
count of reuse and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> association</font>

684
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:48,658
domain for the prefix so future work is

685
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,129
to work in particular on the association

686
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,289
domains because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's where the</font>

687
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:53,668
bang is here solo collision avoidance

688
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:56,190
and detection there's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

689
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:57,899
early promising work on this and a lot

690
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">more thinking needs to be done we can</font>

691
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:02,580
use time limited addresses right not

692
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,350
everybody's awake all the time pull them

693
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,210
up take them down like there's 24 hours

694
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,908
in the day and even you guys sleep

695
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,740
sometimes so we can have geographically

696
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:13,470
limited address domains so what if you

697
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,789
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe why does</font>

698
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,350
somebody else have to burn a whole

699
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:18,240
address just because you're using it in

700
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,649
Europe it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any sense so</font>

701
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,299
there's a market address for the domain

702
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:23,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> association this is what the</font>

703
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:24,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Association domain for prefix and</font>

704
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,490
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have you can implement</font>

705
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:31,080
the provider isolation selection system

706
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:33,870
so you may choose you may choose to pick

707
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,029
particular addresses that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in use</font>

708
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,399
like let's say not to pick on anyone but

709
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:40,350
what if cogent has an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

710
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,508
want to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer can</font>

711
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,889
never reach cogent or anything coach it

712
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,559
carries well then you guys might

713
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:47,939
mutually agree to just segment that

714
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,408
particular customer space

715
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:55,169
so each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these is going to need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

716
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:57,240
model so there's some engineering

717
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:58,559
challenges prefixes are going to be

718
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,799
multiple originated there multiple

719
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,480
originated now we can explore the space

720
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,070
many conflicting uses will be minimally

721
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,840
disruptive this could be used by

722
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,539
providers to limit peer-to-peer access

723
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,970
like if Comcast Verizon just both use

724
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:14,129
all the same space why don't they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

725
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,250
both use all the same space so their

726
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:20,639
customers can never talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other</font>

727
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's an idea market mechanisms need</font>

728
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:23,908
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed you know the actual</font>

729
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,500
detection of collision mitigation and

730
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,970
the modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these prices is going to</font>

731
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,100
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by groups like by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

732
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:33,000
rirs in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that i would suggest</font>

733
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,408
flow instrumenting the internet core at

734
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,750
a high rate so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can determine</font>

735
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:39,059
like the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when have we gone</font>

736
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:41,399
too far for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular resource so</font>

737
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:43,740
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all I'm an Outlook this is a</font>

738
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,229
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nutty it's all very very</font>

739
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:55,679
difficult work but the payoff is insane

740
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:59,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">this can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make us safe from v6 again so</font>

741
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,450
that's it any questions

742
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,669
I'll defer to the moderator for a

743
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,290
selection of the order of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

744
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:08,120
Michael husband is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this time for</font>

745
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:12,530
questions but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am actually gonna close</font>

746
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:16,879
the line after<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin levy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm</font>

748
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,240
this talk of derivatives it says a lot

749
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,100
like oil trading so this you know would

750
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,360
you possibly be the vp of IP addresses

751
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,040
at this point yeah yeah no I like it's

752
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,000
not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me but I think I think you</font>

753
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,960
can fund a lot of good<font color="#CCCCCC"> registry work and</font>

754
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,980
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need to be a lot of</font>

755
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,530
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna instrument the core of the</font>

756
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:39,440
internet on offsets on the trades

757
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:41,810
absolutely absolutely let's go to mr

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:57,860
numbing work so so I really see this as

761
00:32:54,350 --> 00:33:00,530
fraught with peril and in what I really

762
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,740
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see happen is that the air in DC</font>

763
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:05,570
take up all the policy for implications

764
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,000
of this and put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good</font>

765
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,710
proposals as we go forward and i'll be

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to work with people on the air and</font>

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,929
Aaron's board to really figure out how

769
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,550
we can implement this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a policy</font>

00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">framework around this obviously</font>

to be taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously by anyone let</font>

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:22,950
kind of pharmaceuticals led to this

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,899
I i think it's a it's it is lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

830
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,220
there's a simple solution here and you

00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:56,040
know Bell oven did it already there RSC

832

take the remainder of it header and have

834

00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,290
reignited Larry I'd like to point out

853
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you say you know apply the same</font>

854
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">v6 addresses to certain entities and</font>

855
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,439
share the same with certain other

856
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,899
entities of the opposite side of the

857
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,880
world then maybe that whole lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT</font>

858
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,320
and v6 thing is resolved hi Brandon I am

859
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,010
intrigued by your theories do you have a

860
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,780
newsletter to which I can subscribe yes

861
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,560
last question in the back I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

862
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:18,410
then we're done a li ho oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry good</font>

863
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,410
Lee Howard and I choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to affiliate</font>

864
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,160
I'll start with I actually had a very

865
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,690
similar idea I chose to keep it to

866
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,558
myself

867
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:31,059
if you have lessons on how to do that I

868
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,949
would be happy to have them there are

869
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:35,410
lots of interesting ways that we can

870
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:39,150
create pockets of unreachable ax t on

871
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:42,549
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on ipv4 this is but one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

872
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:45,880
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact people use doing</font>

873
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:47,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially this now by using squatted</font>

874
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,680
at what we call squatted address space

875
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:52,299
internally and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it looked at</font>

876
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,569
from that perspective this isn't quite

877
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:57,519
as crazy as it seems she's saying

878
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's lots of good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas here that's</font>

879
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,269
why they're hearing you say um

880
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,859
experiment expressed in a completely

881
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:08,618
different way there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something here</font>

882
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:10,749
that's sane so so I mean sigh I guess I

883
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,880
also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and treat you a little</font>

884
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:15,129
bit attractive your suggestion a little

885
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,529
bit seriously and say there's there is

886
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,479
potential room for work<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I'm not</font>

887
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:21,400
quite with mark on directing the

888
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:22,930
Advisory Council to it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's my</font>

889
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,089
job to direct the Advisory Council to

890
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,499
provide advice i'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font>

891
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:28,390
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked the Advisory Council to do</font>

892
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:29,680
that just yet but they have brains of

893
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:32,288
their owns and can come up with their

894
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,479
own ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> too I think it's like very</font>

895
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:36,940
quickly yeah I have a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

896
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:41,288
Michael Sinatra UC Berkeley actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

897
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:44,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">a comment um this is this proposal</font>

898
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:46,839
provides all of the benefits of things

899
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,940
like carrier-grade NAT but none of the

900
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:51,549
complexity it reduces a huge layer of

901
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,989
complexity and since we all know that

902
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:54,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the more complexity you have the lower</font>

903
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,529
the reliability this has the potential

904
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> significantly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more reliable than</font>

905
00:38:56,529 --> 00:39:02,019
carrier-grade NAT so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Tommy</font>

906
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:03,309
the comcast about this later on so thank

907
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:05,999
you all for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and attention if</font>

908
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,999
