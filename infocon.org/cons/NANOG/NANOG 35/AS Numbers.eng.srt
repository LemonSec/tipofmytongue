00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,490
I work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a peening um I have a</font>

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,160
confession to make after being in this

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,879
business for way too many years I've

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:21,330
never been to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an anode before so thank</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having me and certainly i'll try</font>

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,589
and reply your repay your hospitality by

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,900
at least giving you a couple of our

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,698
presentations the first one is today is

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,948
largely technical and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">about something near and dear to all of</font>

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,820
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearts which is autonomous system</font>

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,398
numbers tomorrow I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a little</font>

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit more fanciful in trying to figure</font>

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,940
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen to this</font>

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,980
industry over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coming years but this</font>

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">morning is more nitty-gritty and it</font>

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,449
really is a topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I sort of</font>

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,190
wandered into by accident looking at

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,010
autonomous system numbers and how

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,640
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> were using them the original</font>

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,589
design of BGP and that dates back to the

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,199
late 80s Early 90s made the wild-eyed

23
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:08,070
fantastic assumption that that never be

24
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,729
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 65536 separate autonomous</font>

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,689
routing domains in this world

26
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:14,908
considering that at the time there were

27
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">little under two hundred monopoly telcos</font>

28
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,909
operating this did seem a remarkably

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,549
fanciful number oddly enough we're

30
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,790
chewing through it pretty quickly this

31
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,930
is the total map of all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS</font>

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,179
the sky the green is what's left that we

45
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,390
could still<font color="#E5E5E5"> allocate from in that</font>

current pools

47
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,579
and the yellow over there on the right

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:20,670
is what I anna has left so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

some numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that out of the six</font>

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,110
chewed through a little under 40,000

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,519
leaving us a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> under 25,000 so this</font>

56
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,640
morning I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go through</font>

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,610
three things very quickly when are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

58
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,950
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run out of this remaining pool</font>

59
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,200
what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do then and how are</font>

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,820
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it how does it impact you</font>

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,350
and I in trying to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing</font>

62
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,310
system so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first win this</font>

63
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">presentation and the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that follows</font>

64
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,040
tries to make some guesses as to how

65
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,010
fast we're chewing through them and it

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,010
uses public data sources in this case

67
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,620
what I use is periodic snapshots of the

68
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,959
BGP routing table predominantly from the

69
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,720
route views project so this dates back

70
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,780
to around<font color="#E5E5E5"> November 1997 Thank You route</font>

71
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,180
views I also go through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR</font>

72
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,880
assignment data and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect a</font>

73
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,760
time series from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also have combed</font>

74
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,549
through the iono data and from that I've

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,670
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a s count of</font>

76
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,799
unadvertised numbers and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying</font>

77
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,140
to push forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and make some</font>

78
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,700
forward extrapolations here and rather

79
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">than taking the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> history i've just</font>

80
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,429
used the previous thousand days and

81
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:52,540
we'll see why so firstly what am i

82
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,390
assuming the first thing I'm assuming is

83
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,970
that for whatever reason you happen to

84
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,500
like your old a s numbers you've grown

85
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,290
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honda them you have attached to them</font>

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,390
and you're never going to give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

87
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,600
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no recovery of unused a s</font>

88
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,339
numbers in this model in actual fact I'm

89
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,019
really not sure why you'd bother I

90
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,690
actually don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a real</font>

91
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,670
benefit in so doing so in actual pic my

92
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:19,180
assumption assumes that whatever you

93
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have you keep um secondly and this is a</font>

94
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more contentious in it when I</font>

95
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't really up</font>

96
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,409
but i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a s numbers will</font>

97
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,739
saturate I actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's going</font>

98
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:35,750
to be constant and continued demand why

99
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,090
if I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it what I see is</font>

100
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the use of avail umbers in a</font>

101
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,739
number of contexts but increasingly

102
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,990
we're doing finer grain traffic

103
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,629
engineering further and further down the

104
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,120
hierarchy of connectivity and an actual

105
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:52,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">fact right now in the way it works in</font>

106
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,830
the routing system<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing works by</font>

107
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:56,090
effectively announcing more specifics

108
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,669
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easiest way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing that is</font>

109
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,289
with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own autonomous system number</font>

110
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:03,620
so that what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing is more and more</font>

111
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:04,878
finer grained use of a s numbers and if

112
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look into this and</font>

113
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,610
actually plot the amount of address

114
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,430
space / announced a is you see that it's

115
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,349
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down which kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of collaborates or</font>

116
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,090
cooperates the fact that realistically

117
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:19,039
we are chewing through them at a pretty

118
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,650
high rate and by little counts to

119
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,259
continue to do so so it's just business

120
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,359
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll keep on going the other thing</font>

121
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:28,759
I'm assuming and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case</font>

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,909
it's right that<font color="#CCCCCC"> envy for its</font>

123
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:35,270
horrendously wrong but for a s numbers

124
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:38,000
there's no rush because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transition</font>

125
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,729
out of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> space is relatively painless</font>

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,879
and if you already hold an AS number and

127
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:46,669
already have deployed bgp you don't have

128
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:50,300
to do anything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no real reason</font>

129
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:52,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">to rush on the remaining numbers that's</font>

130

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before so in this model</font>

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:57,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm assuming that there's no scarcity</font>

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,990
and used rush<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll just plow through so</font>

133
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:04,580
the first piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data this is the</font>

143
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,080
hard to tell at this level<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

144
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,330
a linear plot you could do an

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,419
exponential plot of the last thousand

146
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,320
days and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear which of those</font>

147
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,570
models is been

148
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,790
at this level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of granularity but the</font>

149
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,380
answers are pretty different at an

150
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:46,100
exponential growth model you're looking

151
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,130
much much closer to 2014 than not at a

152
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,020
linear growth model you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

153
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,820
2024 which you know is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in</font>

154
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,840
my lifetime always very close to my

155
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,400
retirement which is better one of the

156
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,440
ways of looking at doing trend fitting

157
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,929
is to actually figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how what your</font>

158
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,660
mean error rate is so what are plotted

159
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,840
is the mean error of each of those daily

160
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,240
samples for both linear and exponential

161
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,969
the red is<font color="#E5E5E5"> linear the green is</font>

162
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,890
exponential so that what I see at that

163
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,340
level of detail is in fact that the

164
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,690
number of a esas we're using is growing

165
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,580
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a small but quite</font>

166
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,980
discernible exponential growth trend

167
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,430
happening so now it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

168
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:31,100
more definitive as to what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

169
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:33,650
let's construct the model now firstly

170
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,720
you kill off all day s numbers and keep

171
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,520
them around five percent of the existing

172
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,050
alive a as numbers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to die this</font>

173
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,310
year and whatever you're going to do

174
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,130
with their<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you ebay them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

175
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">know five percent of them are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

176
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,430
disappear and become unadvertised

177
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,020
they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back they're</font>

178
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,160
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be reclaimed that it's</font>

179
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,219
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disappear from the routing</font>

180

182
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,750

183
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,040
recent assignments take around<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,320
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually appear in the routing</font>

185
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">table so once you actually get an A s</font>

186
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,050
number there's a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of work</font>

187
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,450

188
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,230
announce it so that's taking to account

189
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,849
as well so what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do at</font>

190
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">least at this stage is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out</font>

191
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,600
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a problem at what point</font>

192
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,080
will need to actually have something

193
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,090
else on the ground and running so a

194
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,440
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of factors here I'm using an</font>

195
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,289
exponential growth trend for the

196
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,060
advertised numbers what I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> shown</font>

197
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,260
but is in some of the references is to

198
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,140
how I then plot the growth of

199
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,210
unadvertised numbers and the way I done

200
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,699
that is to use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> best fit of saying that</font>

201
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,729
the unadvertised numbers are growing at

202
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,900
a ratio according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the advertised and</font>

203
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,700
what I'm finding is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

204
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,870
unadvertised pool is growing but at a

205
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,540
slower rate

206
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,310
so then I look at the rirs themselves

207
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,900
the five points where<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s numbers</font>

208
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,150
allocated and look at their relative

209
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,850
consumption rates and model the way the

210
00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:02,000
rirs work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

211
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:04,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> date at which any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rir can't say yes</font>

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,840
the date at which their particular

213
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,120
number pool is exhausted so the first

214
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">rir that runs out is the date that I'm</font>

215
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,300
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for um here's the big model I</font>

216
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,340
won't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the details of how I</font>

217
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,199
got there but it's been biding to half

218
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,840
the left half is what we've seen the

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,850
right half is where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going the red</font>

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,890
continue the green line going up is the

240
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,630
quite figured out what time of the day

241
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,959
yet but if you move at a time probably

242
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:26,370
get there the assumptions behind that

243
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,330
when you don't need your<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS nomber</font>

244
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,870
you're going to keep that there's no

245
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,970
reclamation the rirs assignment policies

246
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,070
will continue largely as they are now no

247
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,280
real change its deadly increasing

248

assumption consumption trend and no last

249
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,699
chance rush is going to happen so we're

250
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,530
just going to steadily move towards that

251
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,580
exhaustion point what we can do about it

252
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,890
there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal kicking around</font>

253

inside the IETF and has been for<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite</font>

254
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,699
some years I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years from</font>

255
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,770
Emory we're up to version 11 of the

draft and it's a relatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple</font>

00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,400
change

258

you take all the places where you see to

259
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:06,780
bite a s numbers and change it to before

260

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,620
where I first initiate a conversation

263
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,840
that remains a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte field because I</font>

264
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,700
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> who I'm talking to but in all</font>

265
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,610
other cases you simply change it to be

266
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,550
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> byte fields that gives us four</font>

267

billion a s numbers the number is

268
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,240
reminiscent it's the 32-bit space all

269
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,280
over again and if we ever run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

270
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,990
those god knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we'll be doing in</font>

271
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,610
the industry and God knows how big your

272
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,320
routers are going to be because with

273
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:39,030
that many a s numbers in play a life

274
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,740
will be hell carry all the a s numbers

275
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,750
using for Mike fields and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only real</font>

276
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,330
places you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the BGP protocol</font>

277
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,280
spec is actually in the a s path and in

278
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,920
the aggregator fields so these are

279
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,780
fields in the update messages so those

280
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,610
fields are effectively expanded to carry

281
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,339
four byte rather than two but same field

282
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,860
same attribute you're using a different

283
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,180
length descriptor going on there we've

284
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,220
actually got further than that we've now

285
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,040
got two independent implementations that

286
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,480
have been published or at least yes of

287
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,130
the draft out<font color="#E5E5E5"> describing the</font>

288
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,800
interoperability one from juniper and

289
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,230
one from redstone so we're now<font color="#CCCCCC"> on track</font>

290
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,599
in the IETF to actually pass this draft

291
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:19,920
forward finally as a proposed standard

292
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,740
so what's the issues around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

293
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,110
transition here I must<font color="#CCCCCC"> admit I'm</font>

294
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,060
impressed when I read the draft it

295
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,500
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a masterful piece of</font>

296
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,089
transition work and my hats off to

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anchor chen i think as</font>

that's only to bite and all of you are

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to do anything at all you</font>

303
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,030
implementation now or later you can sit

304
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,699
on it however if you get handed a 4-byte

305
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:52,949
number where the top two bites aren't

306

<font color="#E5E5E5">zeros in other words a number that's</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry we've long since passed</font>

312
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,480
the idea of

313
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:13,009
doing a snap upgrade overnight putting

314
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,439
it into production routers and seeing

315
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:17,649
how it will go if any of you still do

316
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:20,959
that these days you know I'm amazed

317
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:23,449
these days its exhaustive field testing

318
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,949
exhaustive transition testing there's a

319
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:26,660
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of infrastructure and</font>

320
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:28,160
testing that needs to start up so at

321
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,469
some point yes we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to start doing</font>

322
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,719
field testing at some point we actually

323
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,549
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up an AAS number registry</font>

324
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,069

325
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,989
in it will need the rirs to start

326
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:41,179
kicking in doing full boat is number

327
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:43,579
allocations and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

328
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:46,369
do a stage deployment of these larger

329
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:48,229
numbers and ultimately phase out the

330
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:49,699
allocation and assignments of the two by

331
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,059
day s numbers from the registries

332
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:58,998
there's a reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of work two</font>

333
00:13:53,059 --> 00:14:02,118
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years my guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is two years</font>

334
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:08,470
to four years so if we're really looking

335
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:10,879
at 2010 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the time is 2005</font>

336
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,970
time is running out we actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

337
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,040
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on some of this so what</font>

338
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,749
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do very quickly in the last</font>

339
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,339
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk is simply run through</font>

340
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:21,379
the aspects of this transition to

341
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,689
illustrate how it is intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

342
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,470
and I suppose<font color="#E5E5E5"> view effort to gain some</font>

343
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:30,860
appreciation of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there</font>

344
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:34,179
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 byte is plan in BGP the objective</font>

345
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,709
is to change as little as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

346
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:38,299
certainly the objective is that if you

347
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,878
wish to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue running your current</font>

348
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:44,799
version of BGP in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s domain</font>

349
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:49,220
you should be able to do so indefinitely

350
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:54,049
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to preserve why do we</font>

351
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:57,860
have a s path vectors in BGP and there

352
00:14:54,049 --> 00:15:01,819
are two reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first reason is loop</font>

353
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,739
detection DGP explicitly avoids the

354
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:06,549
traditional distance vector count to

355
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:09,859
infinity by explicitly including an

356
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:11,350
enumeration of all the a esas through

357
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:14,989
which that update has already traveled

358
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:17,899
so if you see yourself you know it's a

359
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:20,629
loop you don't have to constantly go up

360
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:21,830
to some rip metric of 16 or 32 or

361
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,350
whatever it was

362
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,710
I forgotten thank God it's in there

363
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:31,280
already so the AAS path vector is all

364
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:33,950
about saying if I see myself it's a loop

365
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,630
discard<font color="#E5E5E5"> the update that's the first</font>

366
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,030
reason why you have the explicit

367
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,760
enumeration in the path the second

368
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:44,180
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the default best path</font>

369
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:47,000
selection process all other things being

370
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,000
equal and in the absence of any specific

371
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,550
policy if you get two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,940
advertisements for the same prefix pick

373
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,250
the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the shorter a as path so</font>

374
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,390
when you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this transition what</font>

375
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,750
you're trying to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to preserve</font>

376
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:06,380
precisely those two attributes loop

377
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,360
detection and path length metric and

378
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,850
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to avoid because it</font>

379
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,030
really really is out of the question is

380
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,010
a flag day so the world in which we're

381
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,810
going to see the for ballet is going to

382
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,780
be a world where 4-byte asn SAR going to

383
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,270
pop up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at random places in effectively</font>

384
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">an unplanned transition the two boat</font>

385
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:29,569
ones will continue to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> indefinitely</font>

386
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,670
so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this the neat way of</font>

387
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:36,320
thinking about it is in terms of

388
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:38,750
boundaries so when an AS with a larger

389
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">4-byte field</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has appearing session with</font>

390
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:44,090
an AS with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte field what's going</font>

391
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:47,510
on across that transition across that

392
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:49,310
new to old boundary and what the draft

393
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:53,210
does the approach does is to define this

394
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:58,040
in two terms one is I'm new I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking</font>

395
00:16:53,210 --> 00:17:00,080
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> by de esas you're not what do I hand</font>

396
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,810
across to you in the update messages

397
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,660
that preserves all the information

398
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:09,530
required to do path selection and loop

399
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,570
detection and similarly old to new what

400
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,270
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to pass over how do I map it</font>

401
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:17,139
the technique proposed is actually two

402
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:20,900
techniques in one translation and

403
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:23,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">tunnelling the four byte field has if</font>

404
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,000
you will more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when it</font>

405
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,520
enters the two byte realm it throws all

406
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,030
of the four byte is path into an

407
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,490
attribute and pushes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the tube</font>

408
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,629
light field as a bit block the turbine

409
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,790
field doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

410
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,390
doesn't he need to know what's in that

411
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:43,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">attribute the original extended for beta</font>

412
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,920
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part it just tunnels all the way</font>

413
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:48,020
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to bite domain and you're</font>

414
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,660
also and at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you translate</font>

415
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,470
so you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the full bayt a.s numbers</font>

416
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,810
and create to bite equivalence of them

417
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,870
so that you can preserve the AAS path

418
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:02,270
length so we'll see the details of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

419
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:06,110
but the basic technique is translation

420
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,879
and tunneling simultaneously so here's a

421
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,699
few transition cases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

422
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:15,470
first of them relatively simple as1

423
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:17,660
talks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s2 talks to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s1 cold and 10</font>

424
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,140
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big number one is in the high</font>

425
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,210
field who talks to a s-1 column 20 and

426
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,550
the updates flowing from left to right

427
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,830
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s path becomes 1 and then 2</font>

428
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:32,090
comma 1 and then it reaches the

429
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:35,270
transition when the new bgp speaker here

430
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:38,870
is that path 2 comma 1 in 2 byte format

431
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:42,410
it simply pads it out to 4 so that the a

432
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,330
s becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 colon 2 and 0 colon 1 and</font>

433
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,120
just continues through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> football bite</font>

434
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,699
realm unaltered so of course is an

435
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,649
obvious corollary you already have a

436
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,550
full bayt a.s number each<font color="#E5E5E5"> and every one</font>

437
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:57,230
of you just add 16 zeros because that's

438
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:01,580
exactly the same number<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the four byte</font>

439
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:04,100
field next step a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit harder I'm</font>

440
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,810
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte world and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going in back</font>

441
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,780
in sorry I'm in a 4-byte world and going

442
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:12,020
back into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte world now I've got to</font>

443
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:15,530
do something clever why because I can't

444
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,260
preserve those precise<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS numbers in</font>

445
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,790
the tube i twirl<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're too long so</font>

446
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's an AS path that starts at one</font>

447
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Colin 10 and then goes to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new AAS or</font>

448
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,180
new bgp that's actually using an old

449
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">number 0 colon 3 then I go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> column</font>

450
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,950
20 and now here's the transition to

451
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:39,590
things happen I take the AAS path and

452
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:42,620
wherever there are leading zeros I strip

453
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:46,040
them out so in this case 0 colon 3

454
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,129
becomes 3 that's easy but what about 1

455
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,159
colon 20 and 1 colon 10

456
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,770
I can't map them back to 20 and 10

457
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,570
because they're not the same numbers so

458
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,510
the only thing you can possibly do is

459
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,490
whack in a very special a s number a

460
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:03,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">2-byte value called the transition AS</font>

461
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:09,970
VAL you so you construct the dummy<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

462
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:14,350
part 2 3 4 5 6 3 2 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 5 6 does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as1 have</font>

463
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:16,870
a problem with that no because a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s1 is</font>

464
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,510
not looking for a loop between two other

465
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:23,290
a SS when it receives the update it's

466
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:26,500
only looking for a s1 itself so that

467
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:28,090
path even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 3 4 5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 might</font>

468
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,490
theoretically have a problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

469
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">no problem for a s1 are ours too it's</font>

470
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:37,900
just a normal path and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its length is</font>

471
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:40,870
still 3 and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because there</font>

472
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,260
are no<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 by a SS in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte world so</font>

473
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:47,790
there's no loops to detect so that dummy

474
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:52,750
path actually works the two boat world

475
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:54,970
works just fine but somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

476
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,580
preserve that<font color="#CCCCCC"> four byte field why</font>

477
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,230
because further down the update chain

478
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,290
might be another bunch of for bait a

479
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,750
esas and there might even be a loop so

480
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:07,240
the trick is you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the full bayt a.s</font>

481
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,490
path and just lump it down into an

482
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,010
attribute of the update preserving it

483
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,450
precisely so the new way s path

484
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,940
attribute which is that bit at the

485
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:19,630
bottom is actually just tunneled through

486
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,460
the tube i twirled unchanged those three

487
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,940
values<font color="#E5E5E5"> are simply pass through the two</font>

488
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,380
boat world what about at the other end

489
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,290
when I'm coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the two boat</font>

490
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,530
world into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four boat world now</font>

491
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:35,260
there's a subtle variation if I see this

492
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:38,770
attribute is update there's new a s path

493
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:42,340
update i substitute it back in in the

494
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:46,210
trailing part of the is so now if you

495
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:49,720
see the update in blue 1 2 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 5 6 3 2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

496
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,670
4 5<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and then 2 comma 1 comment and so</font>

497
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,340
on and now I go back into a new

498
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,050
transition the first thing I do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> pat</font>

499
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,629
everything out with zeros so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a</font>

500
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">fallback field and then I count the</font>

501
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,720
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> for boat a SS in the new a s</font>

502
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,620
path that I

503
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,770
received and substitute back in what I

504
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:11,439
get back is precisely the fall by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s</font>

505
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,930
path as if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bite world was already</font>

506
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,350
full bite the translation works

507
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:19,300
backwards very cleanly so now what I've

508
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,550
got is a combination of tunneling and

509
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">trend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and translation that effectively</font>

510
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,169
make sure the two bike feels stay in the

511
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">two boat world stays the same the</font>

512
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:33,370
full-back world is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all the work</font>

513
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:35,590
implications<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before that the</font>

514
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:39,370
existing bgp implementations are all

515
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:42,459
doing basically to remain unchanged

516
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:45,070
that's not exactly the case a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

517
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,950
use communities to try and send signals

518
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,450
to remote autonomous systems yep if you

519
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,620
want to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a signal and I'm a</font>

520
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:55,270
4-byte is you can't do so unless you

521
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,070
support the extended community

522
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:02,500
attributes so apart from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> two bites</font>

523
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">off remains the same and of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

524
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,760
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS</font>

525
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,230
path as just simply a bit block just

526
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,450
panel it through as you do with any

527
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,670
other transitive up a community so

528
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,220
nothing changes you can run the new code

529
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,990
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you don't have to if you get</font>

530
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:22,900
a full<font color="#CCCCCC"> body is you have to run the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

531
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:24,490
code there is no choice so if you want

532
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do community signaling in this mixed</font>

533
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,490
world you'll need to support extended

534
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,570
communities and you'll need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so</font>

535
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:34,600
relatively quickly I believe you can't

536
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,700
move things on the change the whole

537
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,449
issue about new to all transitions

538
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:42,040
starts at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opened call so if you and</font>

539
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,470
I were running things and I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

540
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,379
dynamically change myself from being old

541
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,480
to new or new<font color="#CCCCCC"> to old it won't happen so</font>

542
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:53,950
I can't move things on the chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

543
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,080
fly what if I'm at an exchange point can

544
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,380
I represent myself as new<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some and</font>

545
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,939
old to others theoretically yes you

546
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,730
could there's nothing in this fact that

547
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,740
stops you doing so but the headache in

548
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,630
terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing the code internally in</font>

549
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,580
the router might prove more than many

550
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,580
vendors are willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually do we'll</font>

551
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,230
see so in theory you can run new and old

552
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,980
simultaneously in prank

553
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:20,260
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably better not to the other</font>

554
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:24,940
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is will you always see in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UAS path</font>

555
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:27,150
no you will only see a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s path when</font>

556
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,620
a 4-byte went through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte world</font>

557
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,809
when you're just going from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stub to</font>

558
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,969
bite to a 4-byte you won't see anything

559
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:36,428
at all you'll simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 pad the AAS</font>

560
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,160
numbers as they come through so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

561
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:40,660
again relatively simple there's a whole

562
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,000
lot more details here that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

563
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in following up on all of the</font>

look through it and figure out your own

technique and come back to me with

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,830
not exponential<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you you know start</font>

584
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,780
taught that was growing exponentially

585
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,760
and was supposed to be you're supposed

586
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,220
to run out of them I believe actually

587
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,520
last year not and we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run out of</font>

588
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,309
them and then quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people looked</font>

589
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,129
at this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think you've compared</font>

590
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:53,139
a linear and exponential and there are

591
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,750
other possibilities for example 2 degree

592
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,380
polynomial seems to have fit that curve

593
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:01,059
much better than exponential and

594
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,919
particularly if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> declare something</font>

595
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,210
exponential you to do a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tests</font>

596
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,890
like for example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to get the</font>

597
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,120
derivative<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the curve or you have to</font>

598
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the area underneath the curve</font>

599
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,610
and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those seems to be</font>

600
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:15,570
exponential so if if we had more time

601
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,729
which still deployed is right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

602
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,168
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> better alternatives but but</font>

603
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,120
what would you do differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

604
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,559
um if you have a look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> report</font>

605
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,449
you'll see a whole bunch of analyses

606
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:27,309
including order<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> polynomials</font>

607
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,980
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a reasonable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of work</font>

608
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:31,750
in that space I'm still of the view but

609
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,179
you know predicting the future you can

610
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,169
use any technique you like I'm still of

611
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:38,740
the view that I think it is

612
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:41,169
exponentially inclined not strongly so

613
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:46,450
but inclined that way would we still do

614
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:50,919
it we've now become a very large very

615
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:52,990
slow very conservative industry it takes

616
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,820
us a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time to do anything and</font>

617
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,159
particularly something as fundamental as

618
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,139
the routing system never underestimate

619
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,880
you know the amount of time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

620
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:03,340
to take for an industry now<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our size</font>

621
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,549
and our weight of our ponderous pneus to

622
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:10,720
do this transition what's the cost of

623
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:15,580
doing it early very little what's the

624
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:18,159
cost of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it late oh my god so all</font>

625
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,769
I'm advocating here is considering how

626
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">slow we moved these days it would be</font>

627
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:25,960
reasonable to start moving on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

628
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:29,139
to give us some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it without an</font>

629
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,460
heir of panic and desperation I think I

630
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:33,189
agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you on that because if</font>

631
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,679
additives 2010 or 2002 and it's not

632
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">really that much time and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to clear</font>

634
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,139
introduced<font color="#CCCCCC"> it better to start earlier</font>

635
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,610
than later resourceful<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just want to</font>

636
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:44,260
point out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the growth may</font>

637
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,689
not actually be exponential it might be

638
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,908
it sort of 2010 on 2024 it might have

639
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,070
been you know 2018 or something which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

641
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,059
this probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> sooner than later oh we</font>

642
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:56,679
could all do<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming in BGP with</font>

their own a esas tomorrow and it could

00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,769
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier who knows yeah the trash can</font>

Randy bush i J um seems to me that

647
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:16,270
whether it's October the 14 to the 15th

648
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,610
the year is not that close and what

649
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:22,179
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing especially for worried about</font>

650
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:26,250
bugs is where we have before us a

651
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:29,500
proposal to introduce complexity and

652
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,150
open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> more bugs and more possibility</font>

653
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,970
for complexity confusion and

654
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,760
configuration messes that will go on

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,940
from the excuse that we don't believe

<font color="#CCCCCC">that in five years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can have code from</font>

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:56,439
and deploy it I don't buy it um thank

660
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,140
you I don't think a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,240
actually required to that this is dan

it or is with ipv6 is there a lot of

actually the v four of these six graphs

699
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,360
just simply seem to consume them as

700
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:38,230
business as normal at a rate that is

701
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,790
phenomenally steady so the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i ask</font>

702
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,440
that is because there's been some reason
