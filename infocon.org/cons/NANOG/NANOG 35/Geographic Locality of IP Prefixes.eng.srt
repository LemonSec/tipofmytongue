1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper that would that we presented</font>

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,559
at imc last week that looks at the

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,200
geographic properties of IP addresses

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,809
contained within any single routing IP

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,480
prefix in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table so actually</font>

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the motivation I mean I sort of thought</font>

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,300
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the started to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem several years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I saw</font>

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,900
some email going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano glist sort</font>

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,689
of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and included some complaints</font>

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,140
about you know having to advertise

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,790
discontiguous prefixes and having

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,120
providing no opportunity for aggregation

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,980
and and also various people saying that

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,599
you know they advertised you know they

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,218
wanted to split a particular prefix into

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,260
two contiguous blocks and advertise it

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,090
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> different locations and a part of</font>

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,500
the motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the studies which</font>

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,110
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that is thinking like well how</font>

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,760
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it the case really that you</font>

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,320
know these discontiguous prefixes are

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,719
preventing aggregation where where it

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,129
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and the converse how</font>

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,750
often is it the case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

27
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,070
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are splitting their their</font>

28
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,049
prefixes into multiple contiguous

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,689
prefixes to get them to better control

30
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,899
and how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that potentially being</font>

31
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,000
messed up

32
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:13,890
ok so the what we studied in this work

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,210
was essentially those two problems right

34
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,670
so the for the first thing we look at is

35
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,548
uh we're studying the extent to which

36
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,590
these IP prefixes are to coarse-grained

37
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:26,490
and by coarse-grained<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I mean two</font>

38
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,899
things really one is that one when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

39
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,020
say prefixes coarse-grained we can say

40
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:33,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you know the prefix is either</font>

41
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,158
being advertised from from disjoint

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,890
places in the geography like two

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,840
different pops and that that and that

44
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,330
the IP prefix is either identical as

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've shown here like to the same / 16</font>

46
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">going out from two different locations</font>

47
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:48,929
but we also consider cases we study

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,899
cases where the IP prefixes are actually

49
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:54,920
contiguous as well so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

50
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">study the extent to which which which</font>

51
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,880
that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the properties of</font>

52
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know how far spread how far spread</font>

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,179
out are any one of these single prefixes

54
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,979
when a single predicts is advertised

55
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,899
from from multiple locations well how

56
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">far how far this thing's spread out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

57
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,380
how many locations do they tend to

58
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,200
contain so talk a little bit about that

59
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,329
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question we consider is sort</font>

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,450
of the opposite question which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is well</font>

61
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:20,730
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often is it the case that we see a</font>

62
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">to discontinuous prefix prefixes being</font>

63
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:27,000
advertised from a single location in a s

64
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:28,410
I'll talk a little bit about how we do

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that because the notion of a prefix</font>

66
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,709
being at a location<font color="#E5E5E5"> really that that</font>

67
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,660
means basically we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

68
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,980
idea of like well where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hosts</font>

69
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,380
and that prefix so in order to do that

70
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,720
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some sampling so let me</font>

71
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,780
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we actually map these IP</font>

72
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,400
addresses or IP prefixes to a set of

73
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,780
locations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really what we want to</font>

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,549
do is for any one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these these</font>

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,380
prefixes we want to say well where are

76
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the hosts actually located behind</font>

77
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,609
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> at any one of it within any one</font>

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,900
of these prefixes and obviously that's

79
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,230
that's a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tricky problem</font>

80
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,230
and

81
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,409
what ultimately we end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is a set</font>

82
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,420
of locations for<font color="#CCCCCC"> any one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

83
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:04,310
prefixes but you can I mean essentially

84
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,569
because we're sampling IP addresses

85
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,950
inside that prefix you can kind of think

86
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this set of locations as a lower</font>

87
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,510
bound so you know we might say the IP

88
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,000
prefix contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> host you know in n</font>

89
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,440
locations when in fact the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of locations inside that prefix maybe</font>

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,510
it's at least n right so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

92
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,879
this well first off we need just a

93
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,190
working set of IP addresses you know

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,858
just to start with so to UM<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

95
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">good set we get a we get if we get our</font>

96
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:31,900
initial set of IP addresses from from

97
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,959
two places the first is there's this uh

98
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,329
this is sort of public CDN project

99
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,459
there's started by Mike<font color="#CCCCCC"> Friedman at NYU</font>

100
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:44,420
called called coral CDN and this thing

101
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets upwards of several million unique</font>

102
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,409
client IP addresses every day in web

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,420
requests so we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as sort of an</font>

104
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,858
initial initial set of client IP

105
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,069
addresses to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

106
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:56,389
convenient because in his in his system

107
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,888
he's actually already running trace

108
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,319
routes back to the clients for various

109
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,879
reasons suey we had some information

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">about where those clients are coming</font>

111
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">from already the other thing we do is to</font>

112
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">just get a better you know a more broad</font>

113
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,669
coverage of the IP addresses in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

114
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,679
routing tables we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all the</font>

115
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:14,599
sets of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> set of all the prefixes from</font>

116
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,329
route views and then we sample those we

117
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,570
basically take I think we took for IP

118
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:23,570
addresses / / prefix regardless of the

119
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,000
size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefix that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was our initial</font>

120
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,039
set of IP addresses now to get more

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,900
actually what we did is we ran as I

122
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,789
mentioned the coral CDN already runs

123
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,520
tray starts back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those those client</font>

124
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:36,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">ip's but also we ran trace routes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

125
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,520
to the IP addresses that we sampled out

126
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">a route views and and that actually gave</font>

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">us more IP addresses to work with so</font>

128
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,940
that that's sort of how we built our

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,770
initial sample of IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well</font>

130
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,060
once we had that of course we sort of

131
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,490
need to figure out like well where are

132
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">these hosts and routers and things where</font>

133
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,710
they actually located so to do that you

134
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,590
know we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a heuristic we just</font>

135
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,150
basically a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

136
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">these IP addresses we can do a reverse</font>

137
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,900
DNS lookup on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's actually an</font>

138
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,719
existing tool as part of the script

139
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:09,159
route project called<font color="#CCCCCC"> undie NS that</font>

140
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:12,280
basically has a lot of rules and

141
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,600
rule sets for how various isp's name

142
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,890
their routers according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pops etcetera</font>

143
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,470
so we're kind of assuming that that that

144
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:22,310
those naming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those reverse dns</font>

145
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,080
entries are actually correct just one

146
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,710
limitation but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

147
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,289
we can do right so from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> d/s DNS</font>

148
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,359
names we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically get a you know a</font>

149
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,400
rough approximation of where that where

150
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,230
that IP address might be sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,419
cases where the clients were fire Walder

152
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,740
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot well we use the traceroute</font>

153
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,540
store advantage right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

154
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,920
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use we what we end up doing is</font>

155
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,990
using the last top on the trace route

156
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,560
where we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually probe and get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

157
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,840
get a reverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS lookup so once we have</font>

158
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
those you know for every IP address we

159
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a set of locations well of course</font>

160
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to figure out like well what</font>

161
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,510
prefixes are we going to bend those IP

162
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,159
addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to do that we use the</font>

163
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,469
route views routing table right and we

164
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,900
just do longest prefix match right so

165
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,370
for every every IP address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

166
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,409
got in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set well we can now</font>

167
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,940
just say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that belongs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this prefix</font>

168
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,270
and we know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of those IP</font>

169
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,070
addresses of course now which location

170
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,780
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in roughly so now we can say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

171
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,730
for each one of these prefixes we've got

172
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,010
a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of locations now as I mentioned</font>

173
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,360
that's that's that set of locations is a

174
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,190
lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> bound right because we're sampling</font>

175
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,920
IP is within any one of those prefixes

176
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,650
but but it gives us you know some some

177
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,419
approximation

178
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,280
so let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the two problems the</font>

179
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,990
first was you know case we want to study

180
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,198
that you know we're calling

181
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,330
coarse-grained prefixes and let me just

182
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of describe to sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the scenario</font>

183
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in then I'll jump</font>

184
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,199
into the two questions of the first sort

185
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,150
of the first sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scenario involves a</font>

186
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,699
situation where an autonomous system a

187
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,859
might advertise a particular prefix and

188
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,990
then a more specific out out each of two

189
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,960
links for example to you know to try to

190
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,729
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic coming in at location</font>

191
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">one and send some of that other you know</font>

192
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:01,810
expressed that it wants some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

193
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:05,979
other traffic coming in from at location

194
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:08,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to right of course now as we know B</font>

195
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:10,330
isn't really obligated to<font color="#E5E5E5"> re-advertise</font>

196
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">those more specific so what might in</font>

197
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,690
fact happen is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the / 16</font>

198
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,479
gets gets free<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise you know why is</font>

199
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,060
it problematic wall of you know

200
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,469
depending on I guess your philosophy

201
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,720
this may or may not be problematic but

202
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,660
we think it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know at least</font>

203
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,180
worth studying because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can cause this</font>

204
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,820
type of behavior to happen whereas a had

205
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,130
actually wanted the traffic for that for

206
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,050
that tent at 1 / 17 coming in at

207
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,430
location 1 and in fact you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

208
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,800
actually wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to achieve isn't</font>

209
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,860
actually happening at all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

210
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,360
thing just sort of another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

211
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,560
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in you know why why this</font>

212
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,750
might be a problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to think</font>

213
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,039
about like why you know what the job of

214
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,300
a routing protocol really is and what we

215
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,150
really want the routing protocol to do

216
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,650
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> express reach ability to a group of</font>

217
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosts right and now if we've aggregated</font>

218
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,039
this information yeah we get we get nice

219
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,320
scaling properties on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hand</font>

220
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">knew if that link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tend to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

221
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,010
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of location</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one had failed well</font>

222
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,930
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get a beach p withdrawal</font>

223
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,230
for that / 17 now and we've got you know

224
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,150
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

225
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,440
worst correlation between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

226
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,729
routing updates that are going around

227
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,500
and and and the actual topology right so

228
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,940
this is you know to to sort of reasons

229
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,030
why we might be worried about prefixes

230
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,820
being too coarse grained the first

231
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,099
question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we that we explored is to</font>

232
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,870
look at these like these you know these

233
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,240
aggregated prefixes like so for example

234
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,700
if we see like a 10 dot 1 / 16 in route

235
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">views we can say okay well you know how</font>

236
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:41,440
aggregate it is that how course is it

237
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,440
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts do we see</font>

238
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,650
contained in any one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those IP</font>

239
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,150
prefixes so so that's the first thing

240
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did in and these results</font>

241
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,750
actually you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general result</font>

242
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't really surprising at all right</font>

243
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,400
some this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cumulative cdf and that's</font>

244
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,689
that's probably a little bit difficult

245
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,130
to read but let me just sort of just

246
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,450
pull out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few data points and help you</font>

247
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,840
read that basically what you can do is

248
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,280
along the along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis is maximum</font>

249
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,060
distance so that's the maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> distance</font>

250
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,920
between any two locations in a set in

251
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of IP addresses within any one</font>

252
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,750
of those IP prefixes and then the y-axis

253
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,120
is the CCDF so what you can do is take

254
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,890
any point on the x-axis and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

255
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,390
well now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i look at the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

256
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,980
y-axis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can say for example from</font>

257
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue line well fifty percent of the</font>

258
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,730
prefixes in that in that blue class 2 /

259
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">82</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / 15 bin span more the maximum</font>

260
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,660
distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> between any those locations</font>

261
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,400
spend more than 100 miles you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

262
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,100
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do the same the same type of</font>

263
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,030
exercise for the for the other plots for

264
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,450
example about ten percent of the

265
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:49,110
prefixes in the

266
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,350
in the 15 to / 23 range spanning more

267
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,610
than

268
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,579
hundred miles um

269
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,500
great um so it's kind of interesting in

270
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:58,969
this curve actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know the</font>

271
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,980
trend is kind of expected right but

272
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,450
what's what turns out to be rather

273
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,269
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some of the case studies</font>

274
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,880
towards the tail right so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

275
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we found one particular is like</font>

276
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,660
a backbone provider and Asia that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

277
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,130
points of presence in various places<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

278
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,140
North America and Europe that had

279
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,910
advertising certain / 24 is where we

280
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,529
found IP addresses that were spread out

281
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,089
more than more than 10,000 miles and

282
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,670
then there were other sort of dial ups

283
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,800
and things like that that also had you

284
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,479
know things of similar sizes that were

285
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,189
spread out you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten locations over</font>

286
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,800
several you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> many thousands of miles</font>

287
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,570
um now you might think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well that's</font>

288
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">not surprising transit providers of</font>

289
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,680
course they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use these IP</font>

290
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,969
prefixes and the the you know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

291
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,439
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> rappers are going to be spread</font>

292
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,089
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over the place what's kind of</font>

293
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,920
surprising is we did find in a few cases

294
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,230
like we did the same study for stub a

295
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">esas and found also that the detail is</font>

296
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,730
quite similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details about that</font>

297
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,640
are in the paper now<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to this</font>

298
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture another thing that that we</font>

299
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,300
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at was let's look at</font>

300
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,680
these these contiguous prefixes the

301
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,660
things that the type of thing that a is

302
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,399
advertising here and we could say well

303
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,709
how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it the case that when we</font>

304
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,690
see two contiguous prefixes it was it

305
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,310
you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> often</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it the case that</font>

306
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,070
those contiguous prefixes are being

307
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,420
advertised from different locations

308
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,560
right so you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often is it the</font>

309
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,110
case that people are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what</font>

310
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,910
would what a a might be do

311
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,380
when we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the pairs of</font>

312
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,880
contiguous prefixes that we saw in route

313
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">views it turns out about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-five</font>

314
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of those contiguous prefix pairs</font>

315
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,690
contained hosts from from different

316
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,250
locations so that's that's kind of

317
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,260
interesting it does suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

318
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,630
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this you know some sort</font>

319
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,610
of like locality you know controlling in

320
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the inbound traffic in this way but it</font>

321
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,899
also suggests something for for one of

322
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,060
these reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

323
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,560
every week right where we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site a</font>

324
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,510
report saying oh they're these

325
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,640
contiguous prefixes with identical<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s</font>

326
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,019
paths look how much we could decrease

327
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,829
the routing table size we just

328
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:55,870
aggregated those so what we did is we

329
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,370
said well how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know let's sort of do</font>

330
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,200
the same study and let's see you know

331
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,390
how true is it like if we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

332
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,010
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually you know advertising</font>

333
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,079
these contiguous prefixes for a reason

334
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,600
well how how much could you could you

335
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,339
reduce the routing table size now so

336
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,890
what we did is actually we did a site a

337
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,740
report style study on our revenues table

338
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,420
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of apply the site</font>

339
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,410
or report rules well it's sort of like

340
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,699
along the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines of what we see every</font>

341
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,010
week right you can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get about</font>

342
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,269
sixty four percent reduction in the

343
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,670
number of prefixes in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

344
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,990
that's great but let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider that</font>

345
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,519
maybe people are actually advertising

346
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,140
these contiguous prefixes for a reason

347
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,579
and they may be you know actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

348
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,980
advertised from different locations etc

349
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">etc and if you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you sort of</font>

350
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,820
repeat you know repeat the study but

351
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,230
apply these these new rules that say

352
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,390
well now we're only going to aggregate

353
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,120
these these contiguous prefixes if they

354
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a s path and they only</font>

355
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,140
contain hosts from the same same

356
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,610
location well then it so turns out that

357
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,980
you only get about a twenty percent

358
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,079
reduction so you know depending on your

359
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,190
you know I mean depending on your

360
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,420
philosophy you know whether you think

361
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know people should be allowed</font>

362
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,800
to do this or not well it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be it</font>

363
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,720
could be construed that the site of

364
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,579
reports vastly overestimating

365
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,189
you know how much for the routing table

366
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">says can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reduced by this type of</font>

367
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:10,689
aggregation

368
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,920
okay so let's sort of consider the

369
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,950
opposite problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> right like we want to</font>

370
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,870
consider the case where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a SI is</font>

371
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,550
advertising you know a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

372
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,520
discontinuous prefixes but it really

373
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,380
only appears to have posts in in one

374
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,420
location or one pop for all of those

375
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,610
sets of prefixes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> why is this a</font>

376
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,229
problem well this goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

377
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,550
routing table size argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it it</font>

378
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,710
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense</font>

379
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,089
for for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> SI to be having to advertise</font>

380
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,760
all these different prefixes when in

381
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:39,440
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if these things are in</font>

382
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,819
fact at the same location you know

383
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,740
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't coming in in different</font>

384
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,310
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're failing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

385
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,930
fashion then wouldn't it be nice if we

386
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of collapse that into</font>

387
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,920
one entry or and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> also in</font>

388
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,480
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reducing routing table size</font>

389
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,189
adduce reduce the amount of churn that

390
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">we saw so we wanted to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like how</font>

391
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,420
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when you look at dis</font>

392
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,860
contiguous prefixes in the rap views

393
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,479
routing table well how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it the</font>

394
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,550
case that those contiguous those

395
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,890
discontiguous prefixes only contain

396
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,380
prefixes from a single location it turns

397
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,420
out actually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a you know</font>

398
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,550
surprisingly common right so if you look

399
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">at any pair of discontiguous prefixes in</font>

400
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,120
the in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralphie's table about seventy</font>

401
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,980
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are only being</font>

402
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,130
advertised or only<font color="#E5E5E5"> only containing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> halls</font>

403
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,370
from a single location is now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

404
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,600
of wonder why that's happening like why

405
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,980
is it that these aliases are

406
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,970
advertising these discontinuous prefixes

407
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,130
that way you might think it has to do

408
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,560
with with allocation and and that's

409
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,089
exactly right so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what seems to</font>

410
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,369
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening is that these a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> esas are</font>

411
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:44,199
being allocated bits and pieces of

412
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,730
address space you know that are not

413
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,979
contiguous and and that that wouldn't be

414
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,319
surprising right you know you think well

415
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,819
of course like an AS uses up its address

416
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:54,759
space while it gets another allocation

417
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:56,829
happens to be not contiguous big you

418
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,420
know no big surprise there but actually

419
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:01,329
there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise right which is</font>

420
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,769
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these discontiguous prefix</font>

421
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:05,109
allocations are actually happening on

422
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,389
the exact same day so a particular guess

423
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,459
maybe getting discontiguous prefix

424
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,779
allocations from<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know</font>

425
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,540
two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk contiguous</font>

426
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:17,189
allocations on the same day we<font color="#CCCCCC"> found</font>

427
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:20,920
that for actually a significant fraction

428
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:23,440
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> given that you know in our study we</font>

429
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,719
suggest we observe the prevalence of

430
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,490
some of these these problems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font>

431
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,040
that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> coarse-grain prefixes can</font>

432
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,740
you know present problems for inbound

433
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,089
traffic control and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine grain prefixes</font>

434
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,740
can inflate the routing table sighs you

435
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:38,230
know it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the thing that we</font>

436
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,110
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about is you know how can</font>

437
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,699
we fix this right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

438
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,680
you know maybe why I got thrown<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

439
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:46,359
research form part of the talk because I

440
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,209
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is rather speculative and</font>

441
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:53,550
probably a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Don to get some angry calm</font>

442
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:55,290
at the end but I the only options I can

443
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,209
think of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix this are actually</font>

444
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,309
rather painful right so I mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

445
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:03,569
one is it like you could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> number but</font>

446
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:05,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">who wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that the other is also</font>

447
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:06,899
rather grimly maybe we should I mean bit

448
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,360
but maybe something that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

449
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about as a research angle and</font>

450
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,009
actually that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that I</font>

451
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:16,019
would like some feedback on is you know

452
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,610
if we you know is you know should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

453
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,050
really be routing on IP prefixes is

454
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,579
there is there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better way to be doing</font>

455
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:26,248
this that that we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make</font>

456
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:27,809
scale so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is a</font>

457
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:29,369
really crazy idea but let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to like</font>

458
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:31,050
let me throw out a seroma and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

459
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:32,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can try to refine it like what you</font>

460
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,769
might initially think of doing is like

461
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,050
what if we just routed based on a s<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

462
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,689
seems ridiculous right because like you

463
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,670
know various<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons you know yes is</font>

464
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:44,040
having lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pops and so forth and you</font>

465
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,660
know wanting to you know have different

466
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
destinations in different pops well well

467
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,420
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you could refine that right</font>

468
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,498
like maybe we don't want to route on asu

469
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,990
on a route on something that's more

470
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:54,689
fine-grain well could we divide our

471
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,759
asses into units or groups of nodes that

472
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:58,589
we know fail and some atomic where that

473
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,749
we know we want to control how traffic

474
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,819
comes into the a s to this group of

475
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:04,740
routers or this area of the a s in a

476
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:07,799
different way than this other area what

477
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,000
can we divide it in that way maybe

478
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,990
that's something to think about like so

479
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,148
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just advertising</font>

480
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,380
discontinuous prefixes well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

481
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:15,658
advertise something that's more like a

482
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,029
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s pop type of type of</font>

483
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:20,819
combination obviously that's that's very

484
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:23,010
speculative I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear like</font>

485
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,809
what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to think about that and</font>

486
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,129
also there's this there's there's a

487
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">really key open question there which is</font>

488
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what are we actually talking</font>

489
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">about like in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like what should</font>

490
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,730
these units be like I threw out pop as

491
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,010
an example but maybe there's a different

492
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,270
unit and depending on what that unit is

493
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,530
of course that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to dictate like</font>

494
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,090
how big the routing table is

495
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,940
actually going to be in whether we could

496
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,220
actually make the scale I think they go

497
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,220
from question so just to sort of leave

498
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,480
you with with what I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

499
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,700
remind you of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the some of the</font>

500
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,190
some of the findings and open questions

501
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,620
we first sort of looked at how often

502
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,300
these these prefixes like identical

503
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,290
prefixes or contiguous prefixes are

504
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,870
being advertised from different

505
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,820
locations we saw obviously not

506
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,919
surprisingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that single prefixes</font>

507
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,720
can span very large distances but also

508
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,530
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these contiguous prefixes often</font>

509
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,060
spend that much based on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

510
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of you know if you apply different</font>

511
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,750
rules based on like you know should

512
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,429
these two contiguous prefixes be

513
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,380
allocated or not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can come to</font>

514
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,090
different conclusions about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

515
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,430
how much you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually reduce the</font>

516
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:28,300
size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the routing table then we looked</font>

517
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,920
at sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the extent to which you know</font>

518
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,930
prefixes may be too fine grained in the

519
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,760
sense that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertising</font>

520
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,610
discontinuous prefixes from from a

521
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,500
single location and there again<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

522
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,209
it surprisingly surprisingly large

523
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,810
amount of

524
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,520
occurring so there I think yeah that

525
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,030
begs questions about routing granularity

526
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,470
and I don't have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> good answers there</font>

527
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:55,889
but I'm interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear what you have</font>

528
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say so thank you take some questions</font>

529
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,570
hi I'm Jeff Houston I'm with a penny you

530
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,460
mentioned the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site a report and that</font>

531
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a report that i generate</font>

532
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,720
these shows and the algorithm that you

533
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,660
pointed out as an algorithm that I

534
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly devised and used right when I</font>

535
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,700
suggest what aggregation possibilities

536
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,440
are out there I actually used three

537
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,080
techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all of which are</font>

538
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,700
imperfect okay the first one is you try

539
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,580
and do a precise match across the

540
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,130
prepend 'add<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS path right so what</font>

541
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,629
you're saying there is if you're trying

542
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,070
to traffic engineer and I see two

543
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,250
prefixes with the same traffic

544
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:38,550
engineering going on then maybe their

545
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,350
candidates for being merged the next one

546
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,000
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I strip out depending sure I strip</font>

547
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,800
out all the prepending and say well you

548
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,910
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same from where I am</font>

549
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:51,480
looking they look the same and the third

550
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:53,730
one is really really brutal or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> origin</font>

551
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,380
your advertising multiple prefixes merge

552
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,700
them I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care about travel</font>

553
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,470
engineering so there are three numbers

554
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,200
come raid<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i guess i'm suggesting</font>

555
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:03,870
like all of which are imperfect rate and

556
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,860
what i was really wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do was to</font>

557
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:09,810
figure out can i merge them with traffic

558
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,959
engineering so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was really wanting</font>

559
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do was to find out if from any</font>

560
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,030
vantage point you always saw the same

561
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,220
par<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that has nothing to do with</font>

562
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,730
geography because realistically

563
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,350
geography doesn't come into routing

564
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,500
what's going on here is I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

565
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,000
understand if people are simply

566
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,270
splashing out more specifics because

567
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,920
they know no better oh and I understand

568
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,470
that yes because they're smashing out

569
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,420
more specifics that I can't see because

570
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,760
of distance<font color="#CCCCCC"> vector</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know around</font>

571
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,070
merging but I can't see the fact that

572
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,780
they're going elsewhere so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

573
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,490
want a research problem around this the

574
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,590
issue is can you from your vantage point

575
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,200
find out if more specifics are somewhere

576
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,270
else with different paths and that would

577
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,150
say well there are localized regions why

578
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,490
I'm actually seeing

579
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,780
more specifics elsewhere right and as

for the routing comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you're</font>

581
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:12,370
gonna well I'll leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to you that</font>

582
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:15,670
point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> well taken i guess the rule</font>

583
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:18,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we applied there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess what we</font>

584
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,710
thought is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have an identical AFF</font>

585
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,270
and an identical location from which

586
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,370
your advertising this prefix then you

587
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,530
know no better but if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

588
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,540
locations for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know for these</font>

589
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,160
contiguous prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> no is there not a</font>

590
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,260
good reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for doing so oddly enough</font>

591
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,300
most of the reasons for traffic cave

592
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,550
most of the reasons for traffic

593
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,620
engineering are very very local<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font>

594
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,440
the real issue is that what we'd like to

595
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the more specifics</font>

596
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:50,430
vaporize when my ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay for you</font>

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:50,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry them vaporizes as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yep</font>

598
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,030
why should I pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your traffic</font>

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,428
haha

602
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:20,380
there's actually a knob request file at

603
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:25,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cisco from a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people to give me</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered prefixes in other words you</font>

608
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,560

<font color="#CCCCCC">that is already announced that I've got</font>

610
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:45,070
right it's got and the knob is gradated

611
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:49,540

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:56,350
portion of the table on kept the rib I'm

615
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:03,030
chopped up from much shorter prefixes by

616
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:11,130
by people who think they're protecting

617
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:14,470
their networks against other people

618
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:18,040
announcing their prefixes by announcing

619
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:21,640
all the possible more specifics I don't

620
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,800
want to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it</font>

621
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,710
can I ask you click now what if someone

622
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay you to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel</font>

623
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,730
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean's not here but he's here</font>

624
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,620
in spirit right yeah i mean i've read

625
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,420
his mails to the to the list as well I I

626
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,709
had a similar idea I notice he suggested

627
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,900
this like I am a fan of Sean door yeah

628
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,970
so so somebody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay me I'm not</font>

629
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,510
here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the religion the food or</font>

630
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,510
the sack right

631
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:48,090
I

632
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,780
but you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying me</font>

633
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,669
what would so if somebody paid me to

634
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,660
carry them ideally ideally be nice to

635
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,510
figure out a situation where you would

636
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:03,300
carry them and I could do what I want at

637
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:07,170
the stubs cool but you're happy like

638
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,700
you're paid somehow right yeah now this

639
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,370
gets back to my comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday about</font>

640
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,030
the lack of a routing economy if you're

641
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:18,239
my customer I'll carrier you're paying

642
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:20,790
but Randy's my peer are you paying me

643
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,040
that's fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about when I pass</font>

644
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:26,850
those across to Randy I understand yes

645
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,280
sir filtering as<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear haha so there</font>

646
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:32,510
she goes how can you devise a routing

647
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,800
economy where you can pay globally

648
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,440
exactly and yeah that has been on the

649
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">table now for about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years and why</font>

650
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,400
hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gone through and just curios</font>

651
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:45,660
no one can figure out how to sort a

652
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,280
nanny<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I do oh sorry people disagree</font>

653
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,500
that Randy should get all the money and

654
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a legitimate disagreement i would</font>

655
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,780
have thought but in fact i have filter

658
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,559
I do accept what my customer announces

659
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,080
they are paying me to do that absolutely

660
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,760
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to listen to</font>

661
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,760
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from him absolutely</font>

662
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,640
oh hey Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> what did you think about</font>

663
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,210
the routing granularity question that's

664
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,210
just curious

665
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:28,049
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about routing so</font>

666
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,999
here's it actually yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> she'd ask you</font>

667
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:32,009
junkie because you suggested 4-byte asn

668
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:34,200
umbers right so what if I what if four

669
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:35,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">bites are enough to hold every you know</font>

670
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,309
again everything back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some</font>

671
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,830
well-trodden paths about how else you

672
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:42,599
could route and perhaps the best

673
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,949
research work to point you out his work

674
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was done at Kate about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

675
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,549
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> focal case at policy animus</font>

676
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:53,759
yeah in and of itself the inter is

677
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:56,009
routing domain is really small 25,000 a

678
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,929
s is the total number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discrete EAS</font>

679
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:59,339
parts up around fifty sixty thousand

680
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:02,729
doesn't grow anywhere near the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

681
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:06,599
prefixes could work well but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

682
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:09,419
flood the association of prefixes with

683
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,908
that topology and then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

684
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:14,309
big problem that Adams gets into of

685
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:16,559
trying to do the association of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

686
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:18,959
course to the fine and then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

687
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:23,249
into the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem as you reach day</font>

688
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:24,839
so by all means explore the space but by

689
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,759
all means also<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand where we've</font>

690
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,700
been already and we've covered a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

691
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:33,809
these parts already new ideas in routing

692
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,719
are amazingly difficult to find and the

693
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:38,158
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths we explore the more we think</font>

694
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:39,899
we've covered most of the visible

695
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,719
corners so now it's a case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

696
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:44,008
got to be pretty deep<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of trying</font>

697
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:47,879
to find areas that might give us

698
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:51,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">traction the other way of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it is to</font>

699
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:52,769
try and limit the noise and that's the

700
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">other way of trying to actually</font>

701
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,609
understand how can I limit fine grain

702
00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:58,589
prefixes and stop them blowing global

703
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:01,918
because I don't need a new routing

704
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:05,428
system if I can limit the extent of fine

705

grain noise now right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> as operators</font>

706
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:09,629
we clutch on what we know we prefer not

00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,939
to put in a new routing system every two

708
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:15,418
years or even every 10 years we prefer

the operator community we're more

interested in pragmatic knobs on

are the whole thing's stuffed let's try

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,019
and do something far more complicated

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,280
that we really don't understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

725
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,370
know something

726
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,370
you

727
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,090
and could you please<font color="#E5E5E5"> help Eddie trigger</font>

728
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,919
could you please go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cider</font>

729
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:04,070
slide there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing I want to</font>

730
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:08,060
disagree whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're sorry</font>

731
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:10,689
there where that as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the close</font>

732
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,179
geographically requirement yep that

733
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:21,680
holds<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one's upstream but let's say</font>

734
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:26,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I advertise 10-0 in LA and 10 dot</font>

735
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,950
one in New York then an old advertising

736
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,020
for level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three then the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

737
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,730
world except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for cogent will see the</font>

738
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,400
aggregate if I also advertise the

739
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,920
aggregate because the more specifics

740
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to be heard by every other</font>

741
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,830
provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> where for them is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

742
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,899
of handed off to level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three so really</font>

743
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,720
the geographically close requirement it

744
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:50,000
does hold for one's upstream but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for</font>

745
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upstream Spears or fellow up streams</font>

746
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,590
well I mean it tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold if as long</font>

747
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,750
as you're guaranteed to go through some

748
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,970
AAS that has the more specifics than

749
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">your fine right right if I aggregate and</font>

750
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,790
then but I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass one of those</font>

751
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,100
people who's holding all the more

752
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:06,830
specifics then then I'm in trouble still

753
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,020
and well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

754
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:12,169
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> te but as far as for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Geographic</font>

755
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">requires short there again you only need</font>

756
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,010
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your upstream not the rest of the</font>

757
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,020
world not the global routing table for

758
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the global routing table just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise</font>

759
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,550
the aggregate and let your upstream

760
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,120
handle the specifics and not export them

761
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,120
to any peers

762
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:35,408
I think um so a lot of this is

763
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:38,999
exacerbated by the view that route fuse

764
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:41,320
has is often the internal view and a

765
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:45,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of those prefixes really don't</font>

766
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,749
make it very far there's also you know

767
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,850
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are too many of them but a bunch</font>

768
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:53,080
of the old networks took a 16 and

769
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:55,449
smeared it across all<font color="#CCCCCC"> their /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 s4 and</font>

770
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,720
loop backs for their entire global

771
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:01,090
network definitely yeah yeah that I

772
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,509
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have never participated in</font>

773
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:05,559
anything of that haha and actually one

774
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:07,960
thing we might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is actually</font>

775
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:10,210
repeat the same experiment would only do

776
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,029
it for stub a esas whatever that means

777
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:18,869
the hour actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can enumerate those</font>

778
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:21,369
we just know them<font color="#E5E5E5"> one 2951 from but I</font>

779
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:23,740
don't another little quibble is I don't

780
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:25,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the registries really by the way</font>

781
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,570
allocate disjoined stuff on the same day

782
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:31,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same I think that was something</font>

783
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,049
that's actually

784
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:42,399
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike Scott with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet um Aaron</font>

785
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:46,940
gave us a basically a block and a half

786
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,650
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave us a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was a 50 now 16</font>

787
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:53,530
and a 17 or something like that they're

788
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:53,530
adjacent but they're not agreeable

789
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,639
it's behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> schedule now so</font>

790
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,640
thanks for your questions and
