with AP neck this morning is certainly

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,320
not a technical talk it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> a talk</font>

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the industry that you and I live</font>

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,119
in and work in and playing and these are

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,109
some I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal perspectives about</font>

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,029
what I've experienced over the last 15

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,640
or so years firstly in the academic and

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,539
research sector and then serving my time

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,530

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,180
and relevant here was the rise of the

you look Mac 1637 all of a sudden

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,510
somewhere in Europe people started

townhouses and everything else they turn

60
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,610
to conspicuous consumption and the one

61
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:13,500
place they looked weirdly enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

62
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:16,470
tulip bulbs in 1637 you could buy three

bulbs of a tulip called<font color="#CCCCCC"> tempura</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Augusta</font>

64
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,450
and you'd pay the same amount of money

65
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,870
as a neat little town house in downtown

66

Amsterdam that was a boom that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

amazing boom in tulip bulbs the crash

68

was<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course astronomical it took</font>

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,430
decades to overcome they finally got

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">over it but what a boom it was we never</font>

71
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,670
learned about a century later a Scotsman

bankrupt by the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time wandered</font>

73
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,569
into the French Court it was the time

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,879
building the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Versailles Palace and had a</font>

he said I have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer it's called</font>

their gold for these pieces of paper

80
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:03,599
cool idea furthermore let's set up a

81
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,650
bank to do this even<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooler let's issue</font>

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,869
shares in the bank Wow all of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden</font>

the word millionaire invented<font color="#CCCCCC"> you came</font>

84
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,540
into the French vocabulary because the

85
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,759
share price skyrocketed the boom lasted

86
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,798
for a year the subsequent crash was

87
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,269
amazing three<font color="#E5E5E5"> people lost their lives in</font>

queuing for the bank to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and get</font>

their money back it's seeded I think the

90
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:29,910
French Revolution some 60 years later so

91
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,470
boom and bust is amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in the</font>

92
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,320
another century later in Great Britain

the railway<font color="#E5E5E5"> boon took over and the</font>

five years was accompanied by a

96
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:42,030
phenomenal crash there after that didn't

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,440
mean the death of<font color="#CCCCCC"> railways by the way</font>

98
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,940
but boom and bust is nothing new and

99
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,790
what a boom it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us it was</font>

100
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,740
terrific it was just as euphoric just as

101
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,290
created because the feeding frenzy was a

102
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,320
feeding frenzy on an industry that it

103
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,229
was worth trillions and it was visibly

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,810
not in touch with the world anymore so

105
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:06,719
all of a sudden we were there and what a

106
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,030
boom it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you enter the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf in</font>

1989 there you were as nerds in paradise

108
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:15,299
you were rebuilding that world and we

109
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,800
felt really good about it absolutely

110
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,979
anything was possible I don't know if

111
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,360
you remember this t-shirt this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> tgv</font>

workstation system unit but manages to

121
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,949
connect it to the network anyway and of

122
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,840
course we even had internet toasters as

123

some of you might remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> John romkey</font>

deserved arrogance anything was possible

00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,940
in the old ways simply weren't there

129
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,889
again another t-shirt this is the ATM

broken bits in mood

was there what sort of a boom was it

144
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,570
actually oddly enough to smite the

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,820
euphoria it wasn't that bigger boom if

only approximately three times higher

than their longer-term value compared to

150
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,860
other booms in other industries which

151
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,670
got up to 100 200 300 times their base

the first answer is where's the product

manager where's the business case

where's the money coming from what's

don't want the wild ride anymore that

means innovation goes out the door that

248
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,290
means experimentation is not part of the

thousand dollars a megabyte they're

264
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,530
greedy we're now looking for value add

everything has to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> value to the</font>

00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,829
packet we're not interested in the crap

267
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,780
packets we're interested in the ones

268
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,240
that we can charge more for we're

269
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,540
interested in recreating the telephone

270
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,680
system of the 1980s where the cost of

271
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the call was irrelevant</font>

272
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,839
what we managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do then as an</font>

273
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,930
industry was charge people for the value

274
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,750
of talking and they paid we want it back

275
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,479
again so now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to look for</font>

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,110
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value-add might set the real</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">question is is it there will this work</font>

278
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,850
in a conservative model so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me talk</font>

279
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,439
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few issues around here and try</font>

280
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and expose I think some of these myths</font>

281
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,410
and some of the underlying realities

282
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,680
this is a really lousy system security

283
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,980
wives and we really don't understand

284
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,959
what we're trying to do the list of

285
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,440
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> in security and there's a few</font>

286
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,349
there are pretty fundamental when I go

287
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,410
to my bank website is it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

288
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:58,550
bank's website when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I type in my secrets</font>

289
00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:02,300
Who am I exposing my money to you don't

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,640
you honestly think that this system is

good enough in its current form

302
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,860
of course you don't all of us understand

303
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,390
this is an incredibly vulnerable system

304
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:52,250
and the trust is what article of faith

00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:30,439
contradictory terms I don't see an

answer let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me turn to the ngn and other</font>

efforts to try and say that IP over

everything is crap IP is not a panacea

368
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:43,999
convergence is something that hello

00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:54,529
the reality we're going to do phones

375

over IP we're going to do television

right wrong tcp/ip doesn't do that and

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:08,000
it never will you can't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pig</font>

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:16,480
nothing more tcp/ip works really well

382
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,089
when you've got wired networks and

383

394
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:52,200
under localized congestion because it

00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:55,660
backs off and die

unless you're willing to over provision

397
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,150
absolutely everywhere so if you're in a

398
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:04,360
carrier and you hear convergence yet

399
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:07,060
again everything over IP is viable quite

400
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,070
frankly it's not true you're not going

to jump your SDH switches your time

you've got our adaptive response

not a network that resource allocates it

made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it go better by factors of all</font>

435
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,780
orders of magnitude of three one

hundred gigabytes and getting higher

440
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,080
dense wave division multiplexing changed

441
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,990
the industry fundamentally in the

442
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,010
long haul it changed it so much that

443
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,630
that entire industry went into glut

444
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,940
there was so much massive supply

445
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,279
overhang that the economics disappeared

446
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,549
and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> one stage on the transatlantic</font>

449
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,370
so could you that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> glass complete</font>

450
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,200
collapse of the market so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we solved</font>

451
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,809
the long haul problem boy did we solve

452
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,299
it so when you eliminate one show point

453
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,639
up comes another and the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

454
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:29,149
now about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last mile access which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

455
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:33,029
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a terrible piece of economics</font>

456
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:35,370
very few industries are prepared to bury

457
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:39,690
their money in the ground<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 25 years</font>

458
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:41,158
and get back at most one percent the

<font color="#CCCCCC">owning industries that we share this</font>

460
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,139
with is probably the water industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

461
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:51,260
the sewage industry we are piping live

462
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:53,908
with it what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology side</font>

463
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,820
ipv4 I don't think was ever meant to

464
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:58,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">last this long in the original idea we</font>

465
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,059
were just an experiment and the big

466
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,700
carrier boys would figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all out and</font>

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:06,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">make OSI work better for us right this</font>

468
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,240
was not meant to happen this<font color="#CCCCCC"> way but</font>

469
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,039
it's happened ipv4 is the dominant and

470
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,309
overwhelming protocol choice for this

471
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,010
industry and now you and I work through

472
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:19,470
Nats overwhelmingly it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that world</font>

473
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,760
and the contradictions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that are now</font>

474
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,830
becoming obvious to the poor old

475
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,230
applications folk peer-to-peer

476
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,210
networking is certainly challenging when

477
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,669
you can't talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me unless I talk to</font>

478
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,769
you first and if we're both behind Nats

479
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:34,350
we can sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do this forever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

480
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:36,840
exchange a single packet when the Nats

481
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:41,668
fail everything fails the service is a

482
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:44,519
fragile and skype is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT</font>

483
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:47,220
successor of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> non skype skype which</font>

484
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:49,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">would speak freely speak freely died</font>

485
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,419
because it assumed there were no<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nats my</font>

486
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,690
address was my real address and you

487
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,820
could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

488
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,280
the twist<font color="#CCCCCC"> would skype is that it's an</font>

489
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,580
app based application what does this

490
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,680
mean we're back into complexity we're

491
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,500
back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost it was complexity and</font>

492
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,810
cost of the same thing so ipv4 is

493
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,950
certainly not an easy thing to work in

494
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,280
these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're writing</font>

495
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,260
applications it's a nightmare so even

496
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,170
with nats we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still running through</font>

497
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,950
the address space this<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't last</font>

498
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:24,790
forever because<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever is a really</font>

499
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">really big turn so what do we do there</font>

500
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:32,110
is I pv6 out there and in theory there's

501
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:34,930
enough address base 128 bits to number

502
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,240
the grains of sand of 300 million plants

503
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:40,000
the size of the earth there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

504
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,890
address space and certainly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

505
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,950
looking beyond the next quarters

506
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:47,920
financial returns if you're looking at a

507
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">long-term industry viewpoint if you</font>

508
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,150
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company will still be around</font>

509
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,930
then at least you should consider the

510
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,130
possibility of what ipv6 might do to you

511
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,840
now I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed I'm not</font>

512
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,580
saying make it into tomorrow's service

513
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,730
platform I think that's very premature

514
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:07,689
and wisely so but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font>

515
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:10,540
should ignore<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ipv6 is not what it was</font>

516
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,310
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> cracked up to be it doesn't have</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better security it doesn't have better</font>

518
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:18,399
qos it doesn't have better<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything it</font>

519
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:21,929
is v4 with bigger addresses and that's

520
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,700
all it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now that might be enough</font>

521
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:28,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">because when you look at the silicon</font>

522
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:31,450
industry chips are being manufactured in

523

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,940
volume silicon industry is stressing our

528
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:51,040
model and there's no doubt that ipv6

529
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:55,000
just with larger addresses has a better

530
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,820
chance of coping<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it but no one</font>

531
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">wants to pay</font>

532
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,830
hello dear customer you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

533
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,220
as well as ipv4 please pay me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

534
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,980
dollars a month more why because now

535
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,500
your mail comes over ipv6 why what did

536
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">it come over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before all ipv4 and that</font>

537
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,320
was obviously worse hello excuse me

538
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,659
what's the change to me as a customer

539
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,270
why should I pay you more I can still

540
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:26,520
surf the web I can still get email why

541
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:29,980
should I pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your ipv6 deployment oh</font>

542
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:32,610
we don't deploy there's no economics

543
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,440
pushing deployment in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current market</font>

544
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,270
so let's think differently what kind of

545
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,510
market are we talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're</font>

546
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:44,200
talking about ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it's</font>

547
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,750
packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> to eyeballs I don't believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

548
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,390
a laptop market I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it's a</font>

549
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-value market I don't believe that</font>

550
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:56,470
ipv6 has anything to do with value-added

551
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:59,530
services at all it's all about a device

552
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:02,380
rich world let's think about a device

553
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:05,110
rich world just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6</font>

554
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,090
on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> R fit on my luggage tag as it goes</font>

555
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,929
through the airline system how much

556
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:13,270
money will i let my luggage tag spend

557
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:16,770
ten dollars you've got to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> joking ten</font>

558
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:20,280
cents well maybe one cent ok you got me

559
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:22,720
in a device rich world the

560
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,350
communications industry that supports it

561
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,270
has to stop thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> value-add has to</font>

562
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,580
stop thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten thousand dollars a</font>

563
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:34,270
megabyte and starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think one</font>

564
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:37,330
ten-millionth of a cent a megabyte the

565
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:40,660
full and really dramatic implication of

566
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:44,820
what the words economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> the so commodity</font>

567
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:48,340
and utility really mean to this industry

568
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">because if we're going to do ipv6 you're</font>

569
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,290
not going to be living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a company that</font>

570
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,060
has gold plated taps in the bathroom

571
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,760
it's a dramatically different company

572
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,669
that works off very slim margins and

573
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,760
ships packets simply as packets as

574
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:06,650
cheaply as possible if ipv6

575
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,830
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really cut it in this world</font>
