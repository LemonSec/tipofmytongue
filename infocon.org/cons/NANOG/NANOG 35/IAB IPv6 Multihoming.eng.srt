1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:06,810
last mom come round and I thought you

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,120
know having been you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,709
community for some time I thought there

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,899
was there was a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that could</font>

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,429
be done to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get information flowing both</font>

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,039
directions and so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of my</font>

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,779
goal here and my little agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,789
here is that like wiki small I'll just

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,830
read it so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna do the goals and</font>

10
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,439
objectives and then I added this one

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,209
thing called what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the IAB anyway</font>

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,599
because of some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,000
heard on that Nana mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list made me</font>

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,290
kind of think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people i know that</font>

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,030
people really didn't understand what the

16
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,769
IAB was and what they could do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,100
they can't do and what it's all about so

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short a couple minutes on</font>

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,789
that then there's then I thought well

20
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,620
it'd be a good thing to get some

21
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,710
organized input to get all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this going</font>

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,780
and I asked Jeff if he'd give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font>

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,730
know overview of what she I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is and</font>

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,820
what I'm the multihoming strategy

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,559
underlying m6 is and then a couple of

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,710
people who voiced interest in talking

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,629
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Jason Ted and Vijay and then</font>

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully so for a few minutes I mean I</font>

29
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,140
might might might is that you know it's

30
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,060
all bootstrapping and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> for most of</font>

31
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time i'm hoping we'll just have a</font>

32
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,920
discussion about where where we should

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,409
be going where we are going what's right

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,689
what's wrong and so forth and then wrap

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,500
it up so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of how I see this</font>

36
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,699
unfolding so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goals and</font>

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,040
objectives here well first I'm we were

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,710
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide a context so we'd have</font>

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,750
a you know an ongoing discussion about

40
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,939
the evolution of the technical aspects

41
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,680
of the multihoming in the internet

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,229
because after all it's the IETF it's the

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,009
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course all the</font>

44
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,990
consequences thereof and provide some

45
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,090
additional up and you know opportunity

46
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">for all of us to provide feedback to the</font>

47
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,509
IETF on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction that we're going</font>

48
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,219
in with multihoming and v6 and so this

49
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an important note that folks really</font>

50
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,530
wanted to be driven home<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best way to</font>

51
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,060
participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the IETF and I think</font>

52
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,060
Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned this earlier is to go to</font>

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the working group you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and and</font>

54
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,930
participate in the working groups

55
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,000
and shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one we're talking</font>

56
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">about here there's a few desired</font>

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,010
outcomes as well I'm hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

58
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,750
we're all hoping that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

59
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,429
able to get an ongoing dialogue so this

60
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,940
won't be the first the last but rather

61
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,610
it's just the first of many and so for

62
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,070
the operator community that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really too</font>

63
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,630
small isn't it awareness about shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

64
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,549
and that effort you know in case there's

65
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,500
some education that needs to be done how

66
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,150
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with the IETF</font>

67
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,700
and what the value of doing that might

68
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,550
be to you for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF community I think</font>

69
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,070
a better awareness of the operators

70
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,980
concerns about about this technology

71
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,829
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful and in general input on</font>

72
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,220
any issues operational issues that you

73
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,470
might find with the emerging spec and we

74
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,660
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I and you know I</font>

75
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,359
think realizing that shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six is not a</font>

76
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,450
complete answer nor are any of the

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,920
policies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been proposed and</font>

78
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,739
that there are many there are many

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,630
aspects of operational aspects of the

80
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,760
shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six environment that are sort of</font>

81
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:15,260
TBD<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the one that comes to mind most</font>

82
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,500
easily as traffic engineering so rules

83
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,220
of engagement this isn't meant to be I

84
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,959
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> told me that rules of</font>

85
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,209
engagement is sort of a military<font color="#E5E5E5"> term I</font>

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,370
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have used it but I didn't I</font>

87
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,800
didn't I didn't know what else<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

88
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,980
know what else to house to characterize

89
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,140
this so first and foremost the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IB folks</font>

90
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,630
including myself I'm kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of got all the</font>

91
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,488
hats on right now are here to listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

92
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,910
the concerns and comments about what's

93
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,620
going on and let's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

94
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,540
we have the you know goodbye directional

95
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,360
information flowing and the folks can

96
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,380
get educated in the ways that they need

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to around this and you know when we're</font>

98
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,420
discussing this you know I ipv6 is being

99
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,340
deployed in some places as we heard

100
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,200
earlier and so if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

101
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipv6 deployed we have to solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

102
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing problem in some way and</font>

103
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,549
shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is about ipv6 I've asked this</font>

104
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,790
question myself on various vacation so

105
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:14,660
why don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do shim for and it's</font>

106
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,130
because Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is being focused the shim</font>

107
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,980
6 working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group is being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on</font>

108
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,048
solving this narrow problem

109
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,950
and again it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not solve all the</font>

110
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:26,929
problems but it's designed to address

111
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,370
site<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing and and there was even</font>

112
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,460
a question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that earlier so that's</font>

113
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,320
that's interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so rather than</font>

114
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,840
go to Jeff first I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

115
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,840
my little thing on the IAB here

116
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,810
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you can read that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

117
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,740
what is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I had that same question</font>

118
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,760
myself when I when I first<font color="#E5E5E5"> started but</font>

119
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,680
basically the IAB is the internet

120
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,060
architecture board it's gone through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,890
lot of evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

122
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,410
cover that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because not only wasn't I</font>

123
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:02,590
there but the history<font color="#E5E5E5"> is somewhat murky</font>

124
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,060
in some places for me anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I i</font>

125
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,219
thought the better thing to do would be

126
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,040
to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the normative reference for</font>

127
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,770
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IAB is and that's RFC 25 fifth</font>

128
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,840
twenty fifty or bcp 39 so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

129
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,950
that up but basically what's here is

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,679
distilled out of 28 28 50 and so we'll

131
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,090
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roles in a second but first</font>

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,940
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the IAB that's that's</font>

133
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,010
that's a question um well you can either

134
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,910
be selected by the Phnom calm honey by

135
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,170
the way how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people know what the</font>

136
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,850
nam come is ok so the nam comments the

137
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,500
nominating committee for the IETF and we

138
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,740
if we have time afterwards we can go

139
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">through what that's about but it's it's</font>

140
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,750
an open forum for nominations of people

141
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,570
to die yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> gene IAB there's an</font>

142

<font color="#CCCCCC">ex-officio</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are ex officio and</font>

143
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:53,050
liaison members of the IAB including on

144
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:56,650
the IRT f chair which is currently aaron

145
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,480
falk and the IAB executive director

146
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,289
which is currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> Richard rich Draves</font>

147
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,610
and then there's some liaison members to

148
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,620
usually there's someone from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sock</font>

149
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,470
someone from the RFC editor is someone

150
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ayana and someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the iesg</font>

151
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,900
so all of these folks are participants

152
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:17,020
in the process that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IAB goes through</font>

153
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so to quickly look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the roles I</font>

154
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,900
don't go through too much of this but i

155
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,750
just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just State this and then</font>

156
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,780
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look at my slides later um</font>

157
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:28,570
basically then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nam com provides a</font>

list of candidates for vacant<font color="#CCCCCC"> IEBC iesg</font>

159
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:36,400

involved in a in the RFC series<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standards process in particular</font>

164
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,570
the process is used to create the

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet standards and it is also served</font>

166
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,280
these are administrative things like

167
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:57,289
there's a appeals board for complaints

168
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,710
when there's an in some kind of concern

169
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:03,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the way the process was executed</font>

170
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so here's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roles liaisons</font>

171
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,030
there's the I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> clays on there's</font>

172
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,549
external liaisons so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like um we</font>

173
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:15,020
need elite liaison to ite study group

174
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:18,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">nine for some reason IAB does that so</font>

175
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:21,320
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part the role that I think</font>

176
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,330
it's most cogent here and that's the i

177
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">beez oversight of the internet</font>

somebody said well daya be said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i forget</font>

181
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,230
where this started this thread started

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,510
that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said halt deployment of ipv6</font>

or something to that effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font>

184
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to make sure folks knew exactly</font>

185
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:43,970
what levers there are so as I said check

186
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,510
out section 2 of<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty 2850 but</font>

187
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,280
basically what are these lovers I mean

188
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:54,469
what can what but what buttons are there

189
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,900
to push well so the IAB can provide

190
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,720
input so these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> architectural this is</font>

191
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,250
where the ia bees actual executable

192
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,430
architectural oversight is documented

193
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,580
and this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can actually do we</font>

194
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,010
can provide input to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg regarding</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">lofts and possible subsequent working</font>

196
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,930

197
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,099
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things here I don't think you</font>

198
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,770
can read that that's what you small

199
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,110
isn't it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that working groups</font>

200
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,210
get created in the IETF normally is that

201
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,620
there's a bath and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion</font>

202
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,080
of the buff is well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> there sufficient</font>

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest to do a working group I be</font>

204
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,580
members cover cover all the buffs during

the IETF and report back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg but</font>

206
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,929
you need to note that the final<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

207
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:40,880
on working group creation is with the

215
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:03,579
and there's a here's a note of one RFC I

216
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:09,670
forget which this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one was but it was 35</font>

217
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:12,279
35<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I be can also organize these ad</font>

218
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,979
hoc bodies of you know experts to look

219
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,559
at technical issues and so there's an

220
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:21,519
for example there's a IP v6 ad hoc

221

committee right now and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I</font>

222
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,869
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is finally the IAB can also</font>

223
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,488
write informational documents so you

224
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:29,110
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the eye in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ID</font>

00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:36,839
become RFC's informational RFC s

those to the best of my ability on sort

249
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,380
of a new person on the IAB so I don't

250
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,260
have that I have neither the history nor

251
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,579
the nor the long-term view of what's

252
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,680
been going on there but I can't either

253

but I will do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so with</font>

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,660
that brief introduction so keep in mind

255
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:55,839
that the IAB has those levers to pull

256
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,399
and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're thinking about this</font>

257
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you want it you want to give us some</font>

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:07,649
now we're going to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to Jeff give</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to actually give you a taste of the</font>

281
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,490
didn't appear by accident it actually

282
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,610
appeared as an outcome of an earlier

283
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,720
working group effort in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF which</font>

was called multi6<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming for ipv6</font>

285
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,810
there were many<font color="#E5E5E5"> formulations of the</font>

286

300

what we call p I address space and you

301
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,290
just multiply announce the routes and

302
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,820
gives various forms of policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of you do it right now</font>

306
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:25,930
the second bullet perhaps is and that's

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> twist can we use the existing ipv6</font>

308
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,900
multi addressing feature where a host

309
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,940
can actually have multiple addresses and

310
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,910
use connection based aggregate

311
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,880
addressing to avoid overloading the

312
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,069
routing system with site based specific

313
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,720
at our advertisements so in words can

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:55,000
simply using the routing system to

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:58,270
achieve the same in goals from memory I

319
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,010
think 35 separate proposals were made

320
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:04,210
into the multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> group and</font>

321
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,069
reading through them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they're</font>

322
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:10,030
about four of us who I think would admit

323
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:13,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to having read all 35 they varied in a</font>

324
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:17,530
wide variety of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways some were router</font>

325
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:23,410
centric some were host centric some work

326
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:26,680
route up plus host the multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> six group</font>

327
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:29,860
working group concluded in effectively

328
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,560
recommending back to the iesg to

329
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,770
continue work in one particular approach

330
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,219
which was called shim sex this was an

331
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:42,550
outcome of about three proposals no<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

332
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually five proposals and the generic</font>

333
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:48,250
idea behind it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the chin six was a</font>

334
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:52,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">host based solution rather than host and</font>

335
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,830
router quite deliberately insofar as

336
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,500
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of the security</font>

337
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,980
implications<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you know that it's</font>

338
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,830
my router being friendly or your router

339
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,250
being nefariously helpful in ways that I

340
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,930
don't want

341
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,970
so the shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 approach was basically</font>

342
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,069
saying if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do this kind of</font>

343
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,750
work it's easier to do it in my stack

344
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,300
and do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way that at least I know</font>

345
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,600
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but have other people</font>

346
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,160
helped me in ways that I might not want

347
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,730
so to host based solution rather than

348
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,829
host and<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather a trickier decision</font>

349
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,930
because at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time the IETF is</font>

350
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,230
looking at the protocol called hip the

351
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:33,050
host identity protocol which is

352
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,010
transport based rather than IP and

353
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,890
similarly there has been working

354
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:41,160
standardization of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sctp which is also a</font>

355
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:43,410
transport based protocol shim<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 solution</font>

356
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,490
is one level down in the protocol stack

357
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:49,980
it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like IPSec it doesn't care</font>

358
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:53,010
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper level sessions are active</font>

359
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,770
to that other<font color="#E5E5E5"> host it cares about that</font>

360
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:59,040
other host so this is network layer

361
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:03,270
rather than transport layer it has good

362
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,719
and bad implications it makes IPSec very

363
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,850
very easy but it makes understanding of

364
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,060
what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your current TCP</font>

365
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:16,260
session just that little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit harder so</font>

366
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:21,719
its network layer not transport unlike

367
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:26,550
hip and unlike<font color="#E5E5E5"> sctp it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

368
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen it's negotiated so in other words</font>

369
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,890
you try and start a conversation without

370
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:34,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">any form of Shem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 capability and then</font>

371
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,510
effectively you send a handshake or at

372
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,689
least an expiration message going hi

373
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,790
hello do you talk this sex if the

374
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> press on as always</font>

375
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:47,910
if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is yes to the other end</font>

376
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start doing more work and last but</font>

377
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:53,640
not least because the way this works is

378
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,640
actually locator agility if you can't

379
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,160
bombard the routing system then when my

380
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,160
address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using from provider a</font>

381
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,069
fails I have to flick over to the

382
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,619
address i'm using for provider be but

383
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,540
make sure my upper level protocols don't

384
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,739
know

385
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:15,619
because otherwise they will fail so you

386
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,210
need some kind of consistency presented

387
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,939
to the upper layer protocols which we

388
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:22,700
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an address you need some</font>

389
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:26,000
kind of persistent identity across that

390
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,970
the shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 approach does not invent a</font>

391
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,920
new identity space it reuses locators or

392
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:36,230
addresses as we shall<font color="#CCCCCC"> see so here's the</font>

393
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,840
approach it's a functional module

394
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,510
inserted into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stack at layer 3 in</font>

395
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,120
the area where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would use to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

396
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,370
calls to IP input and IP output in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

397
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,929

398
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:56,030
call it starts off very very blandly as

399
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:58,790
if shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six didn't exist posts that are</font>

400
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:02,080

401
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,250
have multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses and to establish</font>

403
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,030
which address currently works and

404
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,400
happily<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone's already done that work</font>

405
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:16,070
RFC 3484 says if you have multiple

406
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,140
addresses here's what you need to do to

408
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,450
packet exchange so shim sex doesn't do

409
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:27,890
anything different when you start up

410
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:30,470
it's just 3484 same as normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

you to give you some added resiliency so

416
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:46,610
it's a subsequent negotiation on a host

other words you might at the upper

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,049
effectively a tag and that identifier

440

care plus the tag is the state

441
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:46,289
identifier and at this point we're using

442
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:49,019
an explicit end-to-end header to shoot

transport layer you're using an address

466
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:45,418

includes now<font color="#E5E5E5"> a locator pool exchange</font>

with various cryptographic signatures

initially while nothing is broken the

same identifier is the same locator but

495
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,740
now there's a header in there with

or keep alive at that point you go into

a reach ability expiration at the IP

505
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:32,470

sets source and destination until you

507
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,330
actually managed to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful</font>

exchange of packets that then becomes

your new locator sets so that at that

510
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,080
point once you detect failure you

511
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:49,650
explore for new locators and use that

512
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,330
the context field remains the same so

515
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,379
end the other end with that context will

516
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,449
actually recover the original

517
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:05,310

518
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:07,990
as if nothing had happened it's magic

exchange

529
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,730
we are thinking about mechanisms for the

531
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:39,420
those locators try again mechanisms to

00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:42,400
do explicit locator switching switching

533
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,400
there is a need for keep alive at the

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,640
form the base shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six set there are a</font>

573
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,270
whole lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that could happen</font>

574
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,750
thereafter upper level protocols like

575
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:28,720
VoIP might want geez switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

576
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:32,230
quickly be very intolerant of outages

577
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,410
I'm carrying voice I am critical

578
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:38,049
other protocols like massive ftp might

579
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,690
say well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I really don't want my</font>

580
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:42,549
TCP session disturbed an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

581
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,530
actually prefer you to hang around on an

582
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:46,780
outage and see if you can recover more

583
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,480
than constantly flicking locators on me

584
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,190
because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really gives me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hard time</font>

585
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,580
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> upper-level signaling is certainly</font>

586
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,799
part of an extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> or refinement I am</font>

587
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,750
Not sure a bit like Jason how traffic

588
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,250
engineering works at the host level I

589
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's a lot of work to do in</font>

590
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,360
understanding that but that certainly

591
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,340
once we understand how it could work

592
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,168
some potential refinement to the

593
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,439
protocol that allows traffic engineering

594
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:13,270
hints ie this locator set is in a

595
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,510
particular order because that's my

596
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,918
preference please use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way we're</font>

597
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,220
also looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

598
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,559
m6 comes afterwards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial locator</font>

599
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,429
that you pick out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS or set at</font>

600
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:28,899
least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those addresses must work</font>

601
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:31,390
however you might want to use a

602
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,270
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> set of addresses for being the</font>

603
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:37,360
if you will the identifier the local

604
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:39,730
address context<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ula is in v6 how</font>

605
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,309
could you set up these shim sex without

606
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:45,160
having an initial working locator set

607
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:48,970
what we would call contactless shim sex

608
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,620
so it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up at the start various</font>

609
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,780
refinements on<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure detection and</font>

610
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,439
also the age-old problem that again

611
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:58,450
Jason pointed to this morning a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

612
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,940
folk do ingress filtering if I have

613
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:04,390
prefixes from provider a and provider be

614
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,429
and I send provider a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet where the</font>

615
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,950
source address comes from provider be

616
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,540
will provide array accept it or will

617
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,760
they ingress filter the packet out of

618
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:17,168
existence how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do signaling an</font>

619
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">associated egress selection when you've</font>

620
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,309
got ingress filtering and is there some

621
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,620
concept of source address passed

622
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:25,480
selection going on you will not find

623
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,059
answers to these in the initial work

624
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,679
coming out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shem sex but you will find</font>

625
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:31,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these are if you were references to</font>

626
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,520
refinements that work may happen on

627
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,250
later

628
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,710
so Dave that's my brief overview of the

629
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:45,460
functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Shem 6 thank you so</font>

630
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:47,500
thanks Jeff um so what I wanted to do

631
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,710
with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I wanted to get a little bit</font>

632
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">of context of what shim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 is and what</font>

633
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,980
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I what I</font>

634
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,110
want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I want to ask the speakers</font>

635
00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:00,060
to keep it brief so we can get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

636
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,060
we can have the open mic time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

637
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:17,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vijay your next part me</font>

647
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:58,529
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that currently</font>

648
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing is site based not host</font>

649
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,370
based and this doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really lend</font>

650
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:05,820
itself well to current operational

00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,899

does not lend itself well to your needs

658
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,350
the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that currently the</font>

659
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,000
traffic engineering decisions are not

configured at the network level they're

661
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,090
configured on the basically this source

662
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,860
host gets to pick what the order<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

locators is so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets to pick what</font>

664
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,449
traffic engineering happens there needs

665
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,029
to be some sort of modification to the

666

negotiate a pair of addresses source and

or better for the desk

698
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,770
packet filtering is very interesting

699
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:05,810
problem space you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

700
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:08,940
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a TCP session that has</font>

701

migrated over to use upper layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs and</font>

702
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,750
then the underlying source and

703
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:15,600
destination IP address will change so

704
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,790
you may need to somehow map your

705
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,699
existing sessions of non failed

706

707
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,700
what the new source and IP address is

708
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:27,780
and also take into consideration the

709
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:29,820
upper layer ID I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of give</font>

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little insight into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution space</font>

711
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,720
that's been kicked around a little bit

00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any one of these</font>

713
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,900
solutions are real great the first idea

714
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that the destination host sends extra</font>

715
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,370
routing information to the source host

716
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:46,290
so that he can choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right address</font>

717
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:48,899
the second thing is to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and migrate</font>

718
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:51,060
this functionality to a router the third

719
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,770
one is to have the routers change the

720
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,440
network portion of the source and or

721
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination address or n 8 + 8 solution</font>

722
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,100
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing that's been kicked</font>

723
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,500
around is moving the shim function to

724
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,959
the routers themselves so for

725
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,460
destination based te actually getting

726
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,860
the destination host to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

727
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,780
information you basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> either need to</font>

728
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">configure every destination host with</font>

729
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,800
some traffic engineering policy or you

730
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,169
need to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of traffic</font>

731
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,210
engineering policy server that can push

732
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,520
out the traffic engineering policy to

733
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:24,090
all of your hosts it seems fairly

734
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,400
complex there are some security issues

735
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:30,240
I'm sure with this and it still doesn't

736
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,130
fix your transit<font color="#CCCCCC"> as capabilities if you</font>

737
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,320
allow the routers to rewrite the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shim</font>

738
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,180
exchange in other words to reach in as

739
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,439
the packets go by and add to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the locator</font>

740
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:41,400
set some traffic engineering information

741
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,680
this way you can leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

742
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,940
about routing outage is you can

743
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,610
configure your traffic engineering

744
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,200
policy at the network level but there

745
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some concerns with this what routers</font>

746
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,240
do the rewriting can routers and transit

747
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,950
asses do rewriting there's some

748
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,670
additional complexity that needs to be

749
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,670
added to routers

750
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:04,269
the other thing here that's interesting

751
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:06,428
is if transit asses can somehow poison

752
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:08,379
the existing tlv metrics in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the locator</font>

753
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:11,649
set exchange then they can do nras

754
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:13,418
traffic engineering third possibilities

755
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:15,399
move the shim function<font color="#E5E5E5"> altogether to the</font>

756
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:17,919
router in this case the router would do

757
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:19,869
the shimming on behalf of the host or in

758
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,249
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the host the host may shim</font>

759
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:24,428
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the router may put a network</font>

760
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:27,759
level shim there's basically two big

761
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,259
drawbacks to this one is if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your</font>

762
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,029
hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are multi home do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

763
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:33,159
which packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can shim in which you</font>

764
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:34,779
can't and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that all</font>

765
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:37,299
your hosts are multi home to all of your

766
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:40,349
upstream providers or you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

767
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:42,369
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ipv6 and that like solution</font>

768
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:43,718
also you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

769
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:46,478
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for every packet going through</font>

770
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:51,820
the router rich at six million packets

771
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:53,229
per second might be a big deal the last

772
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,289
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of an eight plus eight</font>

773
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:57,999
solution where basically the router can

774
00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:00,009
change the network address for any

775
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:02,409
packet going through so if all hosts

776
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:05,469
have the same host address but different

777
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:08,159
upstream ISPs you can simply swap out

778
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:11,049
the network portion from<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp a2 is BB</font>

779
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,460
and any router can do this and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

780
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,579
problems with this is you have to keep a

781
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:18,039
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> state it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either an ipv6 nat</font>

782
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:19,690
type solution or all of your hosts have

783
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:22,960
to be multi home to all of your upstream

784
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,609
ISPs also rewriting source address may

785
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,089
solve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP filtering issue which is</font>

786
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:30,520
bonus but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again transit a esas are</font>

787
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:32,558
probably not aware that destination a

788
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,690
and destination V are the same host and

789
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,190
can't choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> B instead of a because b is</font>

790
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,260
better they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deliver to a</font>

line rate what routers are going to do

794
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:50,139
it if it's a router in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cord you have</font>

795
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:53,710
to look past labels it may make your

authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> hpac GA what much more</font>

797
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,480
difficult it will break privacy

798
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:01,640
addressing it will break non multihomed

799
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,559
hosts unless you keep a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of state</font>

800
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,480
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any one of these</font>

801
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,549
solutions are great but I kind of wanted

802
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,640
to give you a taste of what people have

803
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:13,829
been talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with that I guess</font>

804
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,098
I'll kick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to Vijay instead of 10</font>

805
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:16,099
but

806
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,240
nobody we don't believe in buddy

807
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,420
was it

808
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:46,040
this is a new laptop

809
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:51,920
Oh

810
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,040
well did<font color="#E5E5E5"> something right first time I'll</font>

811
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:04,669
ok so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> vgl our creo el and we have a</font>

812
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,970
different client base than most people

813
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,830
we either have very small customers

814
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:12,500
dial-up people or we have very large

815
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:15,259
customers as in like cable companies so

816
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,980
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no intermediate enterprise in</font>

817
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,359
the middle so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my take on xem six</font>

818
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,820
after going over then trying to

819
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:25,910
understand it and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stupid man</font>

820
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:28,280
I'm not very smart either but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

821
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,560
beyond my capabilities of actual

822
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,359
understanding because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tend to do</font>

823
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,970
things on an operational basis I carry a

824
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:37,340
pager I am on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 a.m. conference calls</font>

825
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:45,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example when certain providers go</font>

826
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:48,560
away so I I deal with stop oh hai na sir

827
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,750
I didn't see you there how are you so

828
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,279
there are certain issues that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

829
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,260
deal with a three in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the morning that</font>

830
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,210
most people who are designing protocols

831
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:00,859
do not have to see so I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

832
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,390
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pragmatic because if I can't</font>

833
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:04,910
understand at three in the morning and

834
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:06,950
most importantly if I cannot break it

835
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:10,580
down into flintstones chewables for

836
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:13,129
idiots aka my senior management I can't

837
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:17,869
actually run this as an operational

838
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:19,640
network so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my take on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> xem sex so</font>

839
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:21,619
no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go over the summary this is</font>

840
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,040
directly from Vince fuller this pretty

841
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">much summarizes what shim sex is jason</font>

842
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,490
and jeff did a very good job of

843
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,930
explaining it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to skip this</font>

844
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:35,118
entirely and going and<font color="#CCCCCC"> salting more</font>

845
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:37,009
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> next so in my opinion Shem sex is</font>

846
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,580
a rube rube goldberg contraption I

847
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:42,190
believe Aras he's there<font color="#E5E5E5"> used this first</font>

848
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,359
so I'm just going to steal<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from him</font>

849
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:46,490
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues with lightness and</font>

850
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:48,529
selection Jason went over those very

851
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:51,950
clearly and articulately in his slide as

852
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:54,560
well issues I used to work for a large

853
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,660
bank we could barely get dhcp working

854
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,020
with a single IP address

855
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,690
I am Not sure that multiple IP addresses

856
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:09,710
are going to work as envisioned by the

857
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:11,539
ipv6 working group people among other

858
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,480
things I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if people are aware</font>

859
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:17,380
that most large enterprises that I work

860
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,549
with banks and stuff tend to run

861
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:24,230
filtering on the switches so that they

862
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:26,930

990
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,899
when you talk enterprises there's this

<font color="#E5E5E5">is part of their just their normal</font>

1005
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:57,230
course of business already so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

1006
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,299
we're talking about home<font color="#E5E5E5"> users needing</font>

00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,099

1009
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,480
like that I I mean we're talking about

1010
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,820
two different things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1011
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:12,630
need when you actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1012
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:16,050
routing table we are seeing super linear

00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:18,600
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming don't have to explain why</font>

1014
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:21,780
don't have to explain where don't have

1015
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:24,089
to measure their IQs and Randy just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1016
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">us they're all idiots Randy that's the</font>

1017
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,830
point I'm think I don't care I'm saying

1018
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing plane can keep up the</font>

1019
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:34,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">fit is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more interesting the fib is more</font>

1020
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,390
interesting i'm watching database i'm

1021
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,640
basing the fact that the writing plane

1022
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:41,490
can keep up on my database transactional

1023
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,470
rates that i use if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> databases that i</font>

1024
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:46,799
use can keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our current</font>

1025
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:49,350
transactions I have no I no doubt that a

1026
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,620
fast pentium box can't keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

1027
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:54,540
routing table for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the foreseeable future</font>

1028
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,799
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fib is more interesting RS can</font>

1029
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,900
can this wait till I finish the slide

1030
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,670
yeah all right the flip is more

1031
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,250
interesting on the other hand things

1032
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,810
like compression you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> only have a</font>

1033
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:07,830
few hundred outgoing interfaces on a

1034
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:09,720
router all these pads map-21 of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

1035
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,940
of hundred outgoing interfaces and in

1036
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,770
reality the vast majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of traffic is</font>

1037
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,990
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> when pointing interfaces going out</font>

1038
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:20,280
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the order of</font>

1039
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:22,770
tens forwarding convergence may be slow

1040
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,780
and this is where you can actually have

1041
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:29,310
people say the mighty fixes are more

1042
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:31,620
important for i will pay you to converge

1043
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:34,140
those prefixes faster there's technology

1044
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:36,390
available to do this today cisco has

1045
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,339
that implemented they currently base it

1046
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:40,020
on Lou backs and / 32 s which they'd be

1047
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">more important for installation in the</font>

1048
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,580
forwarding table there's no reason why

1049
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:48,060
we can't tag this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementation</font>

1050
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:49,350
detail we can make this work let's take

1051
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to move on the</font>

1052
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:55,960
Ted so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the as counterpoint to</font>

1053
00:46:53,540 --> 00:47:00,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Randy just said</font>

1054
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:04,080
by the way the super linear nature of

1055
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:07,589
prefixes in the global routing table is

1056
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:11,430
very tightly coupled to a esas

1057
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:11,430
advertising more than one prefix

1058
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,009
super linear growth of prefixes

1059
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:23,900
yeah so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said that due to</font>

1060
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:26,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming that was super linear can</font>

1061
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,920
you clarify<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

1062
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:37,290
yes in balti homie yes and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1063
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:39,450
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care because no I mean I</font>

1064
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:41,640
agreed it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> super</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linear I I</font>

1065
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:44,879
think we get the technology can keep up

1066
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,680
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think every time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see this this</font>

1067
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,960
exponential growth curve happen

1068
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,430
something will flatten it out it's the

1069
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,730
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with like the internet growth</font>

1070
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:55,009
in the in the mid to late 90s<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

1071
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,260
saying it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to grow at hundred</font>

1072
00:47:55,010 --> 00:48:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent a year or a thousand percent a</font>

1073
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,490
year and keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing it does but it's</font>

1074
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:05,130
an s-curve you have the initial curve

1075
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:07,319
starts or slow<font color="#E5E5E5"> X expand and then it</font>

1076
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,940
matures and then falls off and i believe

1077
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,510
the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow us to write</font>

1078
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,040
the curve till it falls off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if not</font>

1079
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:16,590
shim sex is not going to bias anything

1080
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,360
more we have to go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to first</font>

1081
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:21,060
principles we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to separate endpoint</font>

1082
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,910
from locator we have to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSE that's</font>

1083
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:27,150
my take on it thank you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what I</font>

1084
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:30,290
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so yeah but what I'm saying is</font>

1085
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:33,450
that is the only go correct answer if

1086
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:35,970
shim sex is gonna bite nobody anything I

1087
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,379
think what Randy and I i I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

1088
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:38,520
to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many words in manis mouth but</font>

1089
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think what we're saying is that it's</font>

1090
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,030
either fixed the problem for real with

1091
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,430
with something like eight plus eight

1092
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,720
right where we're also at five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

1093
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,520
years down the road yes because

1094
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,319
basically if you count on ipv4 style

1095
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing to save you it's not going</font>

1096
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:55,140
to correct yeah I would agree with that

1097
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:57,000
too okay um hey you know I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1098
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,740
chance to show is slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll</font>

1099
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,410
continue it's just quick and busy

1100
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,669
because it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot because uh Jason</font>

1101
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">and Vijay already beat this thing to</font>

1102
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,830
dust a little bit but i'll just add a

1103
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit to it</font>

1104
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:10,968
by the way you know I i had a while

1105
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,680
Ted's getting this thing go and I had a

1106
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:14,150
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea of what these folks</font>

1107
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,160
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna think about this and what</font>

1108
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:18,529
you're going to say and I went off

1109
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,180
looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who might be their</font>

1110
00:49:18,529 --> 00:49:22,939
counterpart and I couldn't find anybody

1111
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,109
so net for the next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this</font>

1112
00:49:22,939 --> 00:49:27,259
which I hope they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a next time</font>

1113
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:28,910
somebody somebody please recommend the

1114
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:32,630
right the right people to strip the plot

1115
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:34,788
how is that what you're saying so

1116
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:36,589
everything that Jason of EJ said in my

1117
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:37,819
opinion is true as well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe what</font>

1118
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:39,920
they're saying and agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1119
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:41,569
wholeheartedly I think some people are

1120
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,339
also missing put some of the problem and

1121
00:49:41,569 --> 00:49:45,170
that it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a v6 problem it's</font>

1122
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:46,578
also a v4 problem and sooner or later

1123
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,769
there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come a point in time</font>

1124
00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:50,930
where both are<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevalent in the world</font>

1125
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:52,339
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's as big a problem as</font>

1126
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:55,788
well and it's being ignored how do you

1127
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:57,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">do both it full table at full scale I</font>

1128
00:49:55,789 --> 00:50:01,849
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boxes we have today will</font>

1129
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:03,380
do it this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because someone got</font>

1130
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:05,479
v6 addresses doesn't mean they're going

1131
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,160
to give back there before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's reality</font>

1132
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:10,819
and that's the business world in the

1133
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,288
<font color="#CCCCCC">world we live in you can try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

1134
00:50:10,819 --> 00:50:15,019
the state to the edge of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network all</font>

1135
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:16,549
this gym six at scale this<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1136
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:18,410
isn't going to work either just ask the

1137
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:19,640
large content providers how that's going

1138
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:22,879
to work I think we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

1139
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,529
different perspective from them wait not

1140
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,219
yet not yet not yet you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1141
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:30,049
chance in the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

1142
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:31,759
pointed out but I will reiterate it

1143
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:33,559
customers pay you for the ability to

1144
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:36,349
control their<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic inbound from you</font>

1145
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:38,630
to them you lose that capability here

1146
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:40,279
unless we add yet another knob or

1147
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:45,170
another field into the protocol to

1148
00:50:40,279 --> 00:50:47,779
address that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other thing is is well</font>

1149
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:51,619
this v6 introduced is adequate attic

1150
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:53,929
adequate address space you know you look

1151
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:55,249
at the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses in elements</font>

1152
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:57,410
so we're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world</font>

1153
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:59,509
is this realistic to assume you can just

1154
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:01,368
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with shim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 when you introduce</font>

1155
00:50:59,509 --> 00:51:02,959
mobility I don't know how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1156
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:04,579
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's these little</font>

1157
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:06,709
things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future man if you play</font>

1158
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:08,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">this thing out yeah if you believe</font>

1159
00:51:06,709 --> 00:51:09,919
there's going to be a v6 address on

1160
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:11,520
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID on the planet man this ain't</font>

going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

1162
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,600
which is probably what's going to happen

1163
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,890
sooner or<font color="#CCCCCC"> later so then you got asked a</font>

1164
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,850
question are we better off<font color="#CCCCCC"> going back to</font>

1165
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,240
the drawing board and trying to

delineate between<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoints and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ID's I</font>

1167

next slide here isn't new technology

1169

supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than the</font>

1170
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:36,720

<font color="#E5E5E5">pay for bigger routers and on top of it</font>

1192
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:33,060
there's this minor issues of initial

connect where if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

probing every possible path you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

and

1200
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:53,359
finally somewhere out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there somebody's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna need to connect you some box you</font>

1202
00:52:53,359 --> 00:53:00,348
get all this information how is it going

1203
00:52:55,759 --> 00:53:02,509
to be moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> to home yeah it's we're</font>

1204
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:04,069
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that like</font>

1205
00:53:02,509 --> 00:53:07,609
Vijay says could be solved with

1206
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:08,899
technology as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it progresses you're</font>

1207
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:12,729
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace some of the works or</font>

1208
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:15,259
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely will not work it is</font>

1209
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:17,959
horrifying and while we may be big

1210
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:19,729
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid the problem by getting a</font>

1211
00:53:17,959 --> 00:53:22,339
couple of 30 tues because we're so

1212
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:23,959
horrifying like Zoe you said horrifying

1213
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:27,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">just can't make some notes err yeah</font>

1214
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:30,558
horrifying it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yahoo</font>

1215
00:53:27,439 --> 00:53:32,779
and google and msn yeah we're big enough

1216
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,949
we could get address space in v60

1217
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home and you move your home</font>

1218
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:38,779
properly the old-fashioned way which

1219
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,098
works much better a lot of the small

1220
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:43,549
guys can't and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1221
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:45,649
screwed because shim six does not in the

1222
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:48,159
way it is right now does not work and

1223
00:53:45,649 --> 00:53:48,159
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not scale</font>

1224
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:59,810
I Randy go the mic so that everyone can

1225
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:07,490
have the benefit of your comments and

going to be trying to delivering packet

1228
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:15,319
stole those v6 shifters out there you've

1229
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:19,070
got the problem yes you can't just

1230
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:21,980
pretend you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I this is this disease</font>

bit of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> chairperson Botha thority here</font>

1234
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">i want you guys to all stay in line but</font>

1235
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:34,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm looking for somebody who wants to</font>

1236
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak in favor of Shem shakes out no</font>

1237
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:40,130
really no don't sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> down if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

1238
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments I was just hoping that there</font>

1239
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:46,070
would be somebody okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay one</font>

1240
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,020
second let this gentleman go cuz he

1241
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:50,570
hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next gen</font>

1242
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:54,950
really so I'm I'm Dana Blair Francisco

1243
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:58,160
the the idea that shim<font color="#E5E5E5"> six is solving of</font>

1244
00:54:54,950 --> 00:55:02,060
disassociating IP address from the

1245
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:05,180
forwarding is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea if you try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1246
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:07,549
solve multa then you see all these

1247
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:11,180
issues however the problems already been

1248
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:12,770
solved with sctp as a transport layer so

1249
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,868
I don't see a reason for another

1250
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:19,040
solution to do the same thing if you

1251
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">want multiple IP addresses per session</font>

1252
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:25,880
then deploy sctp and use the add IP

1253
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:28,869
function so that's like what Jeff

1254
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,930
described as a transport layer solution

1255
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:33,450
go ahead Jeff

1256
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:35,770
all speaking defense of this but I need

1257
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:38,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go back in the first principles</font>

1258
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:40,660
how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually make the routing</font>

1259
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:44,950
system scale if you can't use

1260
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:48,430
hierarchies and no one has given us an

1261
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:51,100
answer that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem number one problem</font>

1262
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:54,970
number two how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make the routing</font>

1263
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:58,150
system into an economy it's fine to pay

1264
00:55:54,970 --> 00:56:02,200
for a routing slot but pay who who's

1265
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:05,520
pushing who's pulling the blood fact of

1266
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:09,189
life is there is no routing economy I

1267
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:12,730
can spit out whatever crap I want and so

1268
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:15,490
can you and no one pays it's a

1269
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:18,190
victimless<font color="#CCCCCC"> crime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we know it doesn't</font>

1270
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:21,279
work when it doesn't work but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

1271
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">then so there is a problem out there we</font>

1272
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:28,360
scared ourselves li+ in 91 we scared

1273
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,820
ourselves in 95 we scared ourselves in

1274
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,770
99 and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on an exponential</font>

1275
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,960
trend again so we go through these

1276
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:36,640
continual shocks are going oh my god the

1277
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,370
routing systems failing what can we do

1278
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,759
administratively to solve it and none of

1279
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">us has any clue none whatsoever there's</font>

1280
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,680
no economy out there so a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1281
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:49,750
foucault's maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can solve this a</font>

1282
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,640
different way because we can't figure

1283
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what a routing economy looks like</font>

1284
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,549
and the big clue appears<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1285
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,790
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand the difference</font>

1286
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:04,450
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> identity and location I don't</font>

1287
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:06,310
think chin<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex is the answer I don't</font>

1288
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:10,379
think hip is the answer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1289
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">think sctp is the answer but I think</font>

1290
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:16,420
very fundamentally that if we don't

1291
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:18,920
separate identity from routing

1292
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,410
forwarding we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die</font>

1293

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to die before I retire which</font>

1294
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:28,578
is real problem for me so somehow we

1295
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:31,520
need experience in trying to understand

1296
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to do that separation and I'm not</font>

1297
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,549
claiming that gym six has got it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I</font>

1298
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,690
think they're a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems</font>

1299
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but there are a whole bunch of</font>

problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight plus eight as well</font>

1301
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:42,619
the whole issue about security about how

1302
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:44,660
to do that binding in a way that

1303
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:46,609
everyone understands that it's between

1304
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:49,430
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and me and not between someone else</font>

1305
00:57:46,609 --> 00:57:51,529
into theory is a problem but we're not

1306
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:54,230
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> robust solutions unless we</font>

00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:57,230
look around<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd speak in defensive</font>

shim sex as being one way of looking at

1309
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:02,630
this I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say and claim now it is</font>

the routing panic of 2010 and the

routing panic of 2015 this is an endless

1316
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:21,740
I'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just make one comment on</font>

1317
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:23,420
that before Jared um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've</font>

1318
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,770
been hearing I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I didn't</font>

1319
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,420
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody disagreeing with what you</font>

00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,520
what this statement you just said but

00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:31,790
what I thought I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">people feel like the cure is worse than</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the disease</font>

this this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> killers not the</font>

1325
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,520
cure well then we've got about a sad

1326
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,799
note when you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really do a</font>

1327
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,619
fundamental change to one of the basic

00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:50,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">tenets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of IP architecture that the</font>

1329
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:52,339
identity and location was the same that

1330
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">was one of the cut throughs that made</font>

1331
00:58:52,339 --> 00:58:56,920
this technology works very simple very

1332
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:59,328
easy but the routing system is suffering

1333
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:03,020
when you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and break that apart again</font>

1334
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:04,849
how you're going to do it I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1335
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:06,380
we can devise a perfect answer these

1336
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:08,119
days we're too big an industry there's

1337
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,250
too much hanging off it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've gotta</font>

1338
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:12,680
look in multiple places this is an

1339
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:15,770
exploration and I hope you learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1340
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:19,069
but I for one<font color="#E5E5E5"> would not say it is going</font>

1341
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:21,520
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the cure it's not right well I</font>

1342
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:24,230
mean couple of points<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance both</font>

1343
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:27,288
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and GRC we don't have the</font>

1344
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:29,930
security in v4 today because we are

1345
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:32,690
currently for example AOL is hijacking

1346
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:34,578
sessions transparently for smtp about

1347
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:36,770
doing smtp and redirecting to our relays

1348
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:39,349
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will recently viewed yahoo.com on</font>

1349
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:42,140
425 it ends up transparently hijacked to

1350
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:44,720
the early days that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevents spam for</font>

1351
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">example certain large communist nations</font>

1352
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:51,038
are hijacking 10 out of 13 root name

1353
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:54,589
servers and are returning transparent

1354

00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're they're going to the wrong IP</font>

right servers so so so bad things happen

1359
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:07,369
in the forwarding plane yes yes what I'm

1360
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:09,710
saying is that we're reviewing the red

1361
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:13,849
herring of like no security in<font color="#E5E5E5"> GRC or</font>

1362
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:15,260
eight plus eight is not I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1363
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:16,730
relevant because we already have the

1364
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">same theory problems today people who</font>

1365
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:21,470
want security<font color="#CCCCCC"> will go application level</font>

1366
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:24,049
end-to-end for the most part it'll just

1367
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:26,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">go to quote unquote work because it's</font>

1368
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:28,099
cheap and it's good enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ninety</font>

1369
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:29,609
percent of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to do for the</font>

1370
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:35,730
remaining ten percent you will use

1371
01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:37,470
end-to-end security so i just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font>

1372
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:40,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">point out to folks that there's a some</font>

1373
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:46,890
pretty nice null isms that i have i have

1374
01:00:40,829 --> 01:00:51,809
a whole folder for null but for me yeah

1375
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:53,400
i keep on getting Vince with more more

1376
01:00:51,809 --> 01:00:54,930
suggestions here but this is the one

1377
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think folks how to look at this</font>

1378
01:00:54,930 --> 01:01:00,690
is a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> classic piece of work and I</font>

1379
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,920
in some ways the URLs I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that up</font>

1380
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:05,460
there so you can see the URL i don't

1381
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,650
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can read it but it really</font>

1382
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:13,309
really outlines what what this is all

1383
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:13,309
about it's a good document some partner

1384
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:23,009
yeah this is the non ROC one yeah this

1385
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,769
one never would this one ever got

1386
01:01:23,009 --> 01:01:30,239
published anyway uh let's see I'll take

1387
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:34,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jared and then Tony next okay hi Jared</font>

1388
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:37,199

1391
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:42,749
assume there will be a wonderful breadth

1392
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:45,509
of new tools such as shim sixth race

1393
01:01:42,749 --> 01:01:47,189
route and and other things that to help

1394
01:01:45,509 --> 01:01:50,609
my users diagnose all sorts of problems

1395
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:52,380
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things just when I even</font>

01:01:50,609 --> 01:01:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">try and wrap my brain around that is I</font>

1397
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,339
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the the wonderful things</font>

1398
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:58,229
other providers have done such as turn

01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:59,819
on hiding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of TTL and how long that</font>

1400
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:01,410
lasted in various networks for

1401
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:04,949
troubleshooting and stuff like that and

1402
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:06,209
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of all these and all these fun</font>

1403
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:08,130
things of you know your machines

1404

broadcasting and IP address banner ads

1405
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:12,359
that we see on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these wonderful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font>

1406
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:14,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">sites out there but I mean it seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1407
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:15,869
the real solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> might actually be some</font>

1408
01:02:14,249 --> 01:02:18,238
sort of new routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol because all</font>

1409
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:20,309
i really see here with any of the ipv6

1410
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,499
stuff is the exact same protocols

1411
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:26,729
implemented but just with different

1412
01:02:22,499 --> 01:02:29,009
headers with more bits and that seems to

1413
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:31,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">be it which and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only potential plus</font>

1414
01:02:29,009 --> 01:02:33,509
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are giving out</font>

allocations that are so large<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at</font>

1416
01:02:33,509 --> 01:02:38,519
least right now we could subdivide them

1417
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:40,100
and pass the 64 and do whatever we

1418
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:42,500

so we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> endless amounts of IP</font>

1420
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:47,830
addresses because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't need a slash</font>

1422

come here let's go um

1423
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:57,259
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to speak in favor of Shem</font>

it since it was conceived not because I

1426
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,609
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's necessarily</font>

1427
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,230
a problem in its own right but it ends

1428
01:03:05,609 --> 01:03:09,269
up changing the fundamental architecture

1429
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:10,980
such that you end up having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rebuild</font>

1430
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:13,379
all of your security<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools from scratch</font>

1431
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,640
not that I p is responsible for security

1432
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:18,450
but everything you've got that is

1437
01:03:26,009 --> 01:03:32,269
all those tools but that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

1438
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">why I got a periodic primary issue was</font>

1439
01:03:32,269 --> 01:03:36,209
connecting kind of question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1440
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:37,950
sure do you think that's a property of

<font color="#E5E5E5">Shem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 or a property of splitting</font>

1444
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:50,249
this is explicitly a shim 6 property but

1445
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:52,710
in fact it may be more locator an

1446
01:03:50,249 --> 01:03:54,058
identifier because if if the security

1447
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,980

01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:57,359
identifier which is what it in theory is

1449
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,980
trying to do is verify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier</font>

and you've moved that somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

1451
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:03,329
you've got to go redo the tools no

01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:04,769
matter how you approach that problem the

1453
01:04:03,329 --> 01:04:07,049
biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue is you're actually just</font>

pushing the problem around right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

1455
01:04:07,049 --> 01:04:10,319

1457
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:15,119
on what is the right answer for

01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:19,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing based on whether you're a</font>

1460

whatever and everybody's perception

1461
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:25,920
about what the right answer is is going

1462
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,799
to be in conflict with somebody else's

1463
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,660
in this room right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there is no single</font>

1465
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,710
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a collection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that are</font>

1466
01:04:32,809 --> 01:04:37,829
probably different than what you've done

01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:39,029
it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> so don't come into this is</font>

1468
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:40,739
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one answer we</font>

1469
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:41,940
can get to because if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all</font>

1470
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:43,710
the requirements coming from all the

different directions<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are explicitly</font>

1472
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,940

01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,349
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> satisfies everybody you just have</font>

to pick something in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1475
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:53,940
that's kind of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> shem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got picked</font>

1477
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,690
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's too bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1478
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,710
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really solve anybody's</font>

1479
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:02,010
problem so

1480
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:04,440
honey stay put for a second so I just

1481
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:06,750
have a question for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> then do you</font>

1482
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,000
think that we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming as</font>

1483
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:11,339

1484
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,990
other words two separate solution spaces

1485
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:17,279
and is it worth all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complexity host</font>

1486
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:20,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing was actually already</font>

1487
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:26,580
implemented and shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six doesn't really</font>

1488
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:28,349
help that per se it it allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do</font>

1489
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:30,589
some failover things that the

1490
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:32,940
application isn't aware of but you know

1491
01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:35,040
multiple addresses on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host was</font>

1492
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,140
defined in v6 to begin with so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

1493
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:39,029
multihoming was already there it's just

1494
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:41,400
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of how transparent it is to</font>

1496
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,080
required if nothing more than as a

1497
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,880
traffic engineering step because it's

1498
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:50,069
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way we've got for doing traffic</font>

1500
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:54,450
routing tools we've got that's the

1501
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,009
mechanism we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do traffic</font>

1502
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:59,669
engineering based off of a stable IP

1503
01:05:56,010 --> 01:06:00,720
address and your kind of stock if we had

1504
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,980
a different way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing traffic</font>

1505
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,319
engineering through a different routing

protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not suggesting I know</font>

1507
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:10,050
what I'm just saying that the big

1508
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,880
argument coming out of this group so far

1509
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,080
is I can't do traffic engineering the

1510
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,820
way I've always done it because now the

1511
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">host you're doing it because this xem</font>

1512
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:20,190
six or even just standard multi

1513
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:21,750
addressing from the host and I do

1514
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:23,910
traffic engineering because I'm the

1515
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:27,240
operator community and you're now taking

1516
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:28,410
my tools away from me and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1517
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,149
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what's happening here</font>

1518
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:31,710
right that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the message is</font>

1519
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:34,380
you're taking my tools away from me

1520
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:37,560
you're not giving me anything back and

1521
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:39,540
you know what you've got back is exactly

1522
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,089
what you've had before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use the same</font>

1523
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,680
site<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing you just give</font>

1524
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:47,990
everybody independent blocks and there's

1525
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,990
12,000 x-ray entries in the table here

1526
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:52,850
yes sir dan<font color="#CCCCCC"> Goulding a related point</font>

1527
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,830
there is it seems like what we've got a

1528
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:56,330
perceived routing problem that may in

1529
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:58,160
fact may or may not turn out to be a

1530
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:59,660
real routing problem and so we've said

1531
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that okay someone's going to have to</font>

1532
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:03,500
kind of take the hit for this and it

1533
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:05,510
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the folks who've decided are</font>

1534
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,980
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the head are to some</font>

degree operators into a larger degree

1536
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:11,330
their customers if this was five years

1537
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,669
ago before lots of enterprises and

1538
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:14,930
content posters were multihomed it

1539
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:16,250
wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal because</font>

1540
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,350
people wouldn't be used to the freedom

1541
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:20,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they have now to drop one provider</font>

1542
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:22,040
and get another provider because they

1543
01:07:20,359 --> 01:07:24,049
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> cruelly provider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> independent space</font>

1544
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,880
but part and parcel of this whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1545
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:28,400
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of provider</font>

1546

1547

and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's happening that will</font>

1572
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:43,000
that broke down is in the computation of

1573
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:48,759
the checksums within the pseudo headers

1576

on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve this particular problem</font>

1577
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:57,340
but sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key consideration is if</font>

1578
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:59,439
you do separate the locator from the

identifier it's important that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">network it doesn't actually matter what</font>

1582
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:10,059
the identifier is because nothing looks

1583
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:12,790
at it it only looks at the locator and

1584
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:14,530
within the endpoints the only thing that

1585
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:16,899
matters is that the identifier is

1586
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:19,389
constant that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> establish security</font>

1588
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:26,230
on the identifier you don't want to base

1589
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:31,330
it on the address as we have seen you

1590
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:35,709
can spoof that in various ways I don't

1591

think shim six is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right approach not</font>

1592
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:40,840
because it disables a bunch of tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1596
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:51,460
it adds a level of complexity within

01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:54,010
both the network's tax as well as with

1598
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:57,010
the operations of the network that would

1599
01:09:54,010 --> 01:10:01,590
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult for me to imagine</font>

1600
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:01,590
that the internet would actually survive

is the people suggest what we can do

1633
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:33,430
mic so far it's pretty plain to see that

01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:35,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet community or the operator</font>

1636
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:42,010
it as a real working solution for any

1637
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:43,960
length of time so given that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:46,900
I myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have broached this with</font>

1639
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:49,960
members in the IETF as well what is the

1640
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:52,900
aversion to read scoping the problem in

1641
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:54,820
addressing v6 as the problem and stop

1642
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:57,129
trying to send stop these stopgap

1643

solutions what is Rollins going back to

1644
01:11:57,130 --> 01:12:02,140
the drawing board and doing this over

1645
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:05,430
and doing it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there anybody in</font>

1646
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:05,430
the room who can answer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1647
01:12:07,349 --> 01:12:12,749
as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it doesn't impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty minimal are you one of them we</font>

have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than three I mean we there</font>

01:12:22,769 --> 01:12:27,859
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot okay good</font>

1652
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:38,199
the answer is what your question is why

1653
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:42,179
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going back and redressing it</font>

1654
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:45,669
that's because it's not an easy problem

1655
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:53,920
all the hard part's got avoided in the

01:12:53,920 --> 01:13:00,550
as an organization has gotten to the

01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:03,280
point where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not going to come up</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with brilliant elegant solutions to</font>

1660

on this stuff in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fashion that isn't</font>

but he never finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and there</font>

1664
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:25,960
that the reason there is no magic

1665
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:28,440
solution is we're stupid and we've

1666
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:31,690
settled for mediocrity and complexity

1667
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:35,678
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an example of it but that's</font>

1668
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:37,780
broken the problem the prob be<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

1669
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,480
actually solved the problem it was

<font color="#E5E5E5">intended to solve address the problem it</font>

1671
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:45,190
was intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve was the press was</font>

1672
01:13:42,849 --> 01:13:48,159
saying the internet was going to

1673
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:51,070
collapse for lack of addresses the press

1674
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:53,909
no longer says that the problem was

1675
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:53,909
solved

1676
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:02,500
I think I think Leslie do you want to do

1677
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,639
you want respond to that orc then I want

1679
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:10,600
I'd kind of like to rebut it a little

the ways of doing things are completely

broken and there is there is simply no

1701

happens to what you have to do to

1705
01:15:05,949 --> 01:15:11,980
rethink how you do routing and

conserved Leslie

1709
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:25,509
the operator community spoke and was

1710
01:15:22,869 --> 01:15:27,940
stuffed the operator community was

1711
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:30,699
speaking here today and you'll notice

1712
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:32,919
though many of us disagreed about which

1713
01:15:30,699 --> 01:15:37,659
part of the sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 we thought was</font>

01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:40,150
plunging all of us said eight plus eight

01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:42,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do believe that made it into</font>

1716
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:44,530
everybody's notes or taking notes today

1717
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:47,500
so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> anime didn't everybody's</font>

1719
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:56,139
the notes ain't doing no good well I'll

01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:58,119
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit let me let me so let me inject</font>

1721
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:59,770
something here folks hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> lily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font>

1722
01:15:58,119 --> 01:16:01,360
wait a second let's not have let's let's

1723
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:03,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">let everybody have the benefit of</font>

1724
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:07,239
hearing what everybody is saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1725
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:08,920
one of the reasons that we that we all

1726
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:10,718
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and decided to do this was</font>

1727
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:13,030
just exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we could get this</font>

1728
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,949
feedback and just exactly so we could

1729
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:18,579
understand if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> any lovers to be</font>

1730
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:20,500
pulled by and so I i think i understand

1731
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:22,960
Randy's concern understand what's going

1732
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,300
on and we're trying at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1733
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're trying to address those very</font>

1734
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:29,650
issues so the feedback and the back and

1735
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:32,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">forth and all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff is very good</font>

1736
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:36,699
positive stuff so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is you</font>

1737
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:38,739
know what what happens next so Leslie if

1738
01:16:36,699 --> 01:16:40,839
I don't wanna let me but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1739
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:43,598
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay please go ahead I know you've</font>

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of you have ever had down streams</font>

1748
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:08,920
running fat pipe boxes and inevitably

1749
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:11,888
those end up causing support calls

1750
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:13,840
because someone's IP address source IP

1751
01:17:11,889 --> 01:17:16,000
address changes you know they hit a

1752

website go back with a new IP address

1753

but the cookie that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have is for</font>

1755
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:27,460
addresses in rapid rapid time has a way

1756
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:32,139
of breaking things at the application

1757
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:35,050
layer other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about m6 kind of</font>

01:17:32,139 --> 01:17:38,170
remind<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of source routing and there</font>

1759
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:41,590
are both leaf and transit networks that

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get that right at the site</font>

1767
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:05,450
level why are we trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1768
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:07,940
now do it with finer granularity on a

1769
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:12,260
much larger much more complex scale at

1770
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:15,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host level and also maybe what we</font>

1771
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:18,050
need is not so much locator per se<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1772
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:20,630
one of the nice things about mpls for

1773
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:22,970
instance is when forwarding in the core

1774
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:26,300
rather than having to look up one route

1775
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:28,400
out of 170,000 possible routes each

1776
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:33,470
router each hop of the way which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

1777
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:36,320
know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stupid we can tag tag</font>

1778
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:38,330
packets and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you have a tag</font>

1779
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:40,670
that pretty much corresponds to the

1780
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:43,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">egress and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of a sudden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

1781
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">have as many lookups similarly for</font>

1782
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">providers who have single home customers</font>

1783
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:53,690
who are connected to two different pops

1784
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:55,970
so perhaps perhaps someone has a

1785
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:59,089
downstream that's connected to both LA

1786
01:18:55,970 --> 01:19:01,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Francisco you assign them a</font>

1787
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:03,800
private asn and you can use that private

1788
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:07,519
asn for all your customers because the

1789
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:09,110
routing policy is the same the<font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font>

1790
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">is different but the routing policy is</font>

1791
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:14,299
the same so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have someone who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font>

1792
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:16,310
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home to SBC and cox we don't</font>

1793
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:19,790
need separate routing policies for each

1794
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:21,710
of these 50,000 people who want to do

1795
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same thing we could all we could</font>

1796
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:26,170
collapse those into one distinct routing

1797
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,170
policy

1798
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,660
okay thank you

1799
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,560
please go ahead you've been waiting

1800

patiently as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thanks name's Chris</font>

1802
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:50,380
forget who started it with a you know a

1803
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:54,130
relatively new idea and I can't claim to

1804
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand the whole thing but I what I</font>

1805
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:57,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think i did grok if I understood</font>

1806
01:19:56,050 --> 01:20:01,450
correctly was that the source of the

1807
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:05,380
idea was that using the source AAS and a

1808
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:07,660
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a part of your your path</font>

1809
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:11,110
decision in other words if you have

1810
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:13,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">fifty thousand rounds all well yeah or</font>

1811
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:15,700
50 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 routes being advertised from a</font>

1812
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:18,100
single source is why do you have to do

1813
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:20,260
individual lookups on each prefix why

1814
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:23,200
not say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this priest belongs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

Vijay was talking about the problem with

1817
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:30,219
the forwarding table you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

1818
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:34,690
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be interesting ways</font>

1819
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:37,330
of solving it as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you you don't</font>

1820
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:39,309
have a situation where where you have

1821
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:43,480
more more multi homers only advertising

1822
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:47,530
a single prefix so you get far far fewer

1823
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:49,000
prefixes / asn<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to think</font>

1824
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:52,360
about the fact that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

1825
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,220
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the no system uses that source AS IS</font>

1826
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,750
any part of the lookup decision other

1827
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:58,480
than the valuating the ass path length

1828
01:20:55,750 --> 01:21:00,870
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if that idea has ever been</font>

1829
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,870
explored

1830
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:08,800
I don't know the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Adams</font>

1831
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:12,699
right yeah the k'da folks had it in

1832
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,860
Adams you're right um search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Adams</font>

1833
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:17,949
and cater website it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was</font>

1834
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:19,598
that Andre it came from<font color="#CCCCCC"> wandering yeah</font>

1835
01:21:17,949 --> 01:21:25,030
but it came from Andre I think that's

1836
01:21:19,599 --> 01:21:27,639
right for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me okay thank you um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1837
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:29,889
so where r times kind of ticking here so

1838
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:35,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">i want to only get Chris and Leslie and</font>

1839
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:37,960
then um go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead please it's easier to</font>

1840
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,980
pick my cup no I wrote a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1841
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:42,610
notes which most everyone has already

01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:43,989
said that my concern about Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six which</font>

everybody up there and have you done

1845
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:50,409
here was it doesn't seem very workable I

1846
01:21:48,329 --> 01:21:52,599
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone would agree that if</font>

1847
01:21:50,409 --> 01:21:54,759
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> blew the routing table up that's</font>

1848
01:21:52,599 --> 01:21:58,570
not with that workable either today<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1849
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:00,880
there's some intersection of time to get

1850
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:02,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to blow up and time to have a solution</font>

1851
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:07,179
that does whatever shim sex is supposed

1852
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:08,770
to do right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I think we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time we</font>

1853
01:22:07,179 --> 01:22:11,079
probably have time to get that and get

1854
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:13,260
the stuff deployed meanwhile vendors are

1855
01:22:11,079 --> 01:22:16,150
already building bigger better faster

1856
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:17,550

I think they take away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and</font>

1859
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:24,178
hopefully for the people in the room

1860
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:26,098
here is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF is the way that this is</font>

1861
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:27,750
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed regardless of other</font>

1862
01:22:26,099 --> 01:22:33,079
particular people's opinions about the

1863
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:33,079
IETF and it is very opaque craziness but

1864
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:39,360
unlike here which is equally opaque and

1865
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:42,199
crazy to other people but the point is

1866
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:44,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this Boff and you</font>

1867
01:22:42,199 --> 01:22:47,400
you came away saying wow this gym six on

1868
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:48,599
sounds really nutty I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1869
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,790
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much I don't think it solves</font>

1870
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:52,739
my problems you need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IETF</font>

1871
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:56,190
meetings or at least participate in the

mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six and do it</font>

1874
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:03,300
like I do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much and try and make sure</font>

1875
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get your out your point across</font>

1876
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,739
is that the IETF working group chairs

1877
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,500
both Jeff and Kurt who are both very

1878
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:13,409
reasonable people you know understand

1879
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:15,500
your point and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ivy is very nice to</font>

1880
01:23:13,409 --> 01:23:19,500
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> them coming and solicit some</font>

1881
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:22,110
response from operators which I noticed

1882
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:25,829
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 2i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ATF's that I went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1883
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:27,179
it didn't seem as much operator you know

1884
01:23:25,829 --> 01:23:28,170
involvement as I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font>

1885
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:29,429
should be especially if you start

1886
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:32,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at gym six and some of the other</font>

a relatively large network operator I

1891
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:44,190
can't get anything done by vendors about

1892
01:23:41,369 --> 01:23:46,829
really having an RFC to point to and say

1893
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:48,540
this either ongoing work and the ITF or

1894
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:50,849
this work that's been done describes

1895
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:51,989
what my problem is in the solution you

1896
01:23:50,849 --> 01:23:55,230
need to implement it and needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1897
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:56,730
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spec so that you know</font>

1898
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:59,579
that's that's how we're going to get

1899
01:23:56,730 --> 01:24:00,959
this fixed either spend a lot of money

1900
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:01,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">on routers would get somebody to do the</font>

1901
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,210
right thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proto</font>

1902
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,010
like that's well said and that's part of

1903
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:09,370
the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing this right</font>

1904
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:11,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">now is because we want we want that kind</font>

1905
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:15,550
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> input and we want to have that kind</font>

1906
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:17,980
of participation and so forth is so well

1907
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,660
set the one last thing is that our nutty

1908

<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Heather reminded me three</font>

01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:33,520
like allocation stuff for v6 so very

soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo will indeed get its own / 32</font>

1913
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:38,010
for every datacenter this week maybe

1914
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:38,010
hooray

1915
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:45,920
this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> Heather says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin is voting on</font>

1916
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:48,500
independent allocations I'll just point

1917
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,660
out that um that's sort of consistent

1918
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,100
with some of the features that I've

1919
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:54,889
heard from different folks in this room

1920
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:57,860
which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that B which can have the</font>

1921
01:24:54,890 --> 01:25:00,610
potential outcome that the ipv4 swamp

1922
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,610
was tiny

1923
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:12,920
so because because you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right</font>

1924
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:18,888
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an unallocated space now by</font>

1925
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:21,949
virtue one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1926

1927
01:25:21,949 --> 01:25:28,969
Heather um one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that what</font>

1928
01:25:24,349 --> 01:25:30,290
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it doesn't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter one of</font>

1929
01:25:28,969 --> 01:25:31,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been saying oh me it</font>

1930
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:33,739
does matter it does matter that we're

1931
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:35,239
taking notes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and and you know</font>

1932
01:25:33,739 --> 01:25:37,339
if you say something we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

1933
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:40,790
to point back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you said it my name is</font>

1934
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:42,440
Heather<font color="#E5E5E5"> sang some from mci um so one of</font>

1935
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:44,090
the things I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been saying is that it's</font>

1936
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,710
interesting in this case that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano</font>

1937
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:49,070
park an<font color="#CCCCCC"> before Aaron as it always does</font>

1938
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:50,929
but the policy part about independent

1939
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:53,389
insight allocations is later in the week

1940
01:25:50,929 --> 01:25:56,150
and so everybody's working on shrimp

1941
01:25:53,389 --> 01:25:59,119
stick stuff and and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming</font>

1942
01:25:56,150 --> 01:26:01,280
stuff but a big part of this and you

1943
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:02,960
know what could end up making this not

1944
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:07,219
at all needed is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people start getting</font>

1945
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:09,530
independent allocations I mean you're

1946
01:26:07,219 --> 01:26:12,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">not gonna you might not be needing to do</font>

1947
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:15,009
this work so it's kind of sending a

1948
01:26:12,139 --> 01:26:15,010
concern right

1949
01:26:15,949 --> 01:26:22,459
that that in some ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1950
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:24,079
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> um there's not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that</font>

1951
01:26:22,459 --> 01:26:27,429
problem doesn't exist we just replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1952
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:29,840
with the other one right right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1953
01:26:27,429 --> 01:26:32,320
think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point here though is that if</font>

1954
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">the provider independent space gets</font>

1955
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:38,409
Jason she alarms are Union nmci I think

1956
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:40,579
if the provider independent space gets

1957
01:26:38,409 --> 01:26:43,190
supported by the individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> ra our</font>

1958
01:26:40,579 --> 01:26:46,190
communities then potentially no one

1959
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:48,558
except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> home users on dsl and cable</font>

1960
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:50,150
modems will be using a shim 6 solution

1961
01:26:48,559 --> 01:26:53,389
for multihoming and traffic engineering

1962
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:54,860
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not sure how valuable that type</font>

1963
01:26:53,389 --> 01:26:57,889
of a solution will be if it's only

1964
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:59,659
implemented by home users because you

1965
01:26:57,889 --> 01:27:04,369
need both sides to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be shim six and we're</font>

1966
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:05,659
for it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful uh-oh your</font>

1967
01:27:04,369 --> 01:27:09,589
peer-to-peer networking will be great

1968
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:11,089
though um I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kathy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to can you</font>

1969
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:13,729

01:27:19,579 --> 01:27:23,959
the thing I see if the air in meetings

1974
01:27:21,409 --> 01:27:26,030
and I encourage you guys to come is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1975
01:27:23,959 --> 01:27:27,499
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us aren't</font>

1976
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:29,090
really keen on the portable address

1977
01:27:27,499 --> 01:27:31,309
block thing for a lot of reasons like

1978
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:33,469
the other problems that happen and so we

1979
01:27:31,309 --> 01:27:34,849
say well gee maybe maybe if we wait a

1980
01:27:33,469 --> 01:27:37,280
little longer the problem will really

1981
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:41,119
get solved so we end up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this circle</font>

1982
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:43,940
where the policy doesn't change and the

1983
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,339
problem never gets fixed so you know

1984
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:47,928
people need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really start</font>

1985
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:48,940
participating in a way that we can solve

1986
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:51,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font>

1987

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm giving Leslie the last one and</font>

1988
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:54,580
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of couple of</font>

1989
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,570
bullets on the slide I want to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1990
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:59,620
you guys so go ahead please<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks so</font>

1991
01:27:57,570 --> 01:28:01,599
Randy's really hard to rebut but somehow

1992
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:02,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't stop me from trying part of</font>

1993
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,360
the reason he saw our drew but is that

1994
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">he makes his point very clearly and very</font>

1995
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:10,199
pointedly but I think Randy the thing

1996
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,760
that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that perhaps</font>

1997
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:14,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">you were overlooking and I don't want</font>

1998
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:17,410
this rune overlooked is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

have an issue this room says<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim six is</font>

2000
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:22,570
DOA maybe that's the right the right

2001
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:24,489
conclusion however<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point I would</font>

2002
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:26,739
like everyone remembers all the other

2003
01:28:24,489 --> 01:28:28,120
little bits discussed this afternoon and

2004
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:30,610
in all the discussions that have led up

2005
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,930
to here which is all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems that</font>

2006
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:35,049
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to solve and how they do</font>

2007
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:36,550
or do not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single solution pain is</font>

2008
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be conserved whether you do</font>

2009
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:40,110
shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six go back to eat + 8 and figure</font>

2010
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:42,340
it out or not and let's not

2011
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:44,830
underestimate the fact that there will

2012
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,750
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain at some point so let's let's</font>

2013
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:48,190
make sure we have the notes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

2014
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:50,980
other things that were said today and

2015
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:52,570
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of why the IV said yes let's</font>

2016
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:57,150
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ball on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and collect more</font>

2017
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:57,150
data where operators pain is our life

2018
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:06,190
okay well this has certainly been

2019
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:08,170
interesting in it and I've I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

2020
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:10,120
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> for participating in because um you</font>

2021
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">know as I said when we started this I</font>

2022
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:13,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">would I kind of grew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the community</font>

2023
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,820
with all of you folks and now that I'm

2024
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:18,400
in the IAB I want to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I can't help</font>

2025
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:21,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">the IAB with all the other people in the</font>

2026
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:24,820
IAB understand more about what the

2027
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,260
operators are thinking feeling and what

2028
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:27,910
they think of some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies</font>

2029
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:31,060
so that was really my goal here and i

2030
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:34,809
think the discussion was really great so

2031
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:36,969
um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had this bullet and it says was</font>

2032
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:38,800
this discussion useful well I mean I

2033
01:29:36,969 --> 01:29:41,170
look at it and I go well it's really

2034
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to tell because unless unless</font>

2035
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:44,710
you're able to see the output of what

2036
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,930
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> here then it's hard to make</font>

2037
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:50,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that evaluation but I hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that at some</font>

2038
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:54,250
point we can we can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with some</font>

2039
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:57,340
vectors for input that are are useful

2040
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:59,600
for folks um and I'm kind of curious to

2041
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:01,400
what people think about you know this

2042
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:04,100
use of their time talking to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IAB</font>

2043
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:05,750
folks like this so and ways that it

2044
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:09,470
could become that we can make it more

2045
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:11,210
useful um I was wondering if people

2046
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:14,180
thought this was a good form to try to

2047
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:16,730
do this in or why not just take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah</font>

2048
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:18,380
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you can anybody want to like do</font>

2049
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:20,299
the Jared this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good forum for some</font>

2050
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:21,920
see because we were thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about with</font>

2051
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:23,510
a lot of a lot of thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> has gone on</font>

2052
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,530
about this within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IAB and one of the</font>

2053
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:25,670
things we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about its</font>

2054
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:27,670
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking it on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a</font>

2055
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:30,530
road show so we're not so geographically

2056
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:31,970
you know North American and go into some

2057
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:34,400
of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> nogs which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think would be</font>

2058
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:36,110
a good idea to because different

2059
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,280
geographies seem to have a somebody

2060
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:39,170
pointed out earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

2061
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:43,969
geographies have different kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ipv6</font>

2062
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:46,190
deployment profiles and there'll be a

2063
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:48,620
summary in and some minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

2064
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:52,370
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right URL and if it's not</font>

2065
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:53,840
all I'll fix it um as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as I as as</font>

2066
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:56,510
soon as I know what the right one is but

2067
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,640
I think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the ID um take a</font>

2068
01:30:56,510 --> 01:31:03,260
viewed guard ITF dot org and it should

2069
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:06,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">be just www IV org</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well it's wrong</font>

2070
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:08,630
that's the temporary address okay that's

2071
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:13,040
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> nevermind that's wrong we'll post</font>

2072
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:15,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the URL when when we get it but I'm</font>

2073
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:19,550
hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

2074
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:21,860
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from this is sort of a renewed</font>

2075
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">a desire to communicate and make the</font>

2076
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:26,420
operator and I EGF community work a

2077
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:28,160
little bit closer together because as

2078
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:29,600
you all know I mean I'm of the opinion

2079
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,550
that I've always been of the opinion

2080
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,820
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF should be more operator</font>

2081
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:36,890
driven but so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my first chance to</font>

2082
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:38,320
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it happen so I'm trying so</font>

2083
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:40,190
anyway thank you all for coming in a

2084
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:42,370
participating I thought it was produced

2085
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:42,370
phul
