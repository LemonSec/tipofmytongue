00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,370
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you so good morning</font>

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hand cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off from the ripe</font>

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:13,649
NCC and i'll be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about AAS</font>

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:17,279
numbers missing in action<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this</font>

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,619
is today's agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you why I</font>

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,300
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> started in this business I'll say a</font>

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,310
few words about the data source<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,320
used and I'll come to the results and

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:34,680
like the speaker before me we also did

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,140
some modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go to this</font>

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,850
fairly quickly since i assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,379
everybody in this room nestled in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

14
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,930
identifier it's a s number AAS numbers

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,559
are assigned in a high reco away

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,160
starting from ayana then to dr eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">li RS and finally to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end users and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this guarantees uniqueness and the INR +</font>

19

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:10,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Leia's numbers use like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeff i explained</font>

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:14,250
in the previous talk asn umbers are

22
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,919
currently 16 bits there's some private

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:23,250
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some overhead and you end up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with 64</font>

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:26,610
and a half thousands available so who

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> naess basically anybody who asked</font>

26
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,130
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who qualifies according to an</font>

27
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:37,110
a is<font color="#E5E5E5"> assignment policy and its policy is</font>

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:41,850
based on RFC 1930 and local policies by

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,700
dr RS and i won't i won't describe him

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,589
in any detail it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically comes down to</font>

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,950
if you can demonstrate it you need one

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,790
you'll get one another important factor

33
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,829
is that the policies all say that if you

34
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,469
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 years and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this appears you have</font>

35
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,130
to return it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the registry and i will</font>

36
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,130
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to that later</font>

37
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:10,979
so next question can we see which ASR

38
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:13,470
use well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is network of a SS</font>

39
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,580
ejs wants to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send traffic to</font>

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,160
another any other a s so the ribs in

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:26,280
your outer have to have a list of all

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:28,230
the a SS well we also assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SS</font>

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,830
are assigned based on demonstrated eat

44
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,200
so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it naively ever EAS</font>

45
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:40,200
that's ever been assigned must show up

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:45,299
in the rib right well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly some</font>

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:49,760
two years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at at the drips</font>

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,890
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> end registry files and back then</font>

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,130
some 20,000 a SS<font color="#CCCCCC"> had been assigned by</font>

50
00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:01,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RRS and some treatment 300 coming up</font>

51
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:03,480
new new every month at the same time in

52
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,298
the rape only fourteen thousand of them

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,380
were visible and only 200 new ones

54
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:12,750
appeared every month so I was a bit

55
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,220
surprised with this and basically ask

56
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,280
the obvious question what's happening

57
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:23,489
here and that's what this talk is about

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:27,780
so where can you find data on a SS in

59
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:31,709
use well the first source is<font color="#E5E5E5"> statistics</font>

60
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,160
files published by the EBR<font color="#CCCCCC"> ers every day</font>

61
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:39,120
prrr since some time to tell in 2002

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,430
they publish a list of all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn dates</font>

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">designs and if you are the bits of</font>

64
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,810
pieces like the countries they have been

65
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:51,630
assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this is a report published</font>

66
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,790
daily since 2002 but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

67
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:59,130
dates of the assignments you can

68
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:03,510
extrapolate back for earlier dates if

69
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:06,120
you do this you have to there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

70
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,640
obvious mistakes in all those files you

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do in all the results i'm going</font>

72
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,059
to show next week or

73
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,420
for those if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the details</font>

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,000
we have a full write-up available where

75
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:24,630
you can see all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the corrections</font>

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,110
we made do this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah next place you</font>

77
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,690
can look at our directs several projects

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,650
collecting rips one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is ripe ncc</font>

83
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,780
what we did was take the data from

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,690
middle of august two thousand still

85
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">orchestra first of this year took all</font>

86
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp paths we ever saw in this data</font>

87
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,489
we broke them down into their<font color="#E5E5E5"> commander</font>

88
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,520
components das numbers and it just

89
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,500
generates a list of a s and the time

90
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,000
when they were used so the first day<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

91
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:15,510
showed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> advances you showed up from</font>

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,669
this list we removed private areas even

93
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">though they should not be visible on the</font>

94
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:24,330
net people do announce them we just

95
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:27,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">removed on for our sample and we also</font>

96
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:31,950
removed a SS<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen for less than a week</font>

97
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,349
we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in particular when people</font>

98
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:38,010
announce a assets into the from the

99
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,669
unallocated ranges this is a typo or

100
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:45,710
something and if it's a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we</font>

101
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,710
hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people recover within a week</font>

102
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:52,140
and finally does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cidery parts which</font>

103
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,830
is a weekly report on the internets as

00:05:52,140 --> 00:06:00,300
seen from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s4 6337 it's available since</font>

105
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,950
1994 that makes is one of the oldest

106
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,979
data series on the internet that's

107
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,900
available and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things in the</font>

108
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,919
report is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of a SS seen in</font>

109
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">Europe for is a s</font>

110
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,710
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this we have essentially two</font>

111
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,040
lists one is the earth numbers of

112
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:24,849
science by their IRS just add files sort

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,920
of the theory and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other list is the</font>

114
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,160
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s is in use the ones you see in there</font>

115
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,400
is and designer reports and then you can

116
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,800
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this next to each other well</font>

117
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:40,000
the normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is of course that naas</font>

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:44,620
appears in both lists the second

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,750
category<font color="#E5E5E5"> is naas that's seen in in do so</font>

120
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,840
in the injuries or in the side reports

121
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,900
but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> science and this can</font>

122
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,710
happen people inappropriate humor using

123
00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:00,039
a SS are problems with registration

124
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,530
mechanism and then there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> third</font>

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,960
category guesses which are assigned but

126
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:09,369
in nothing use and we call those a SS

127
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,190
missing in action so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

128
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:18,630
second category a sec news but not

129
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:21,880
registered in those five years we saw

130
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:26,770
436 a SS that were used at some point

131
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:30,909
but not registered 255<font color="#E5E5E5"> them were still</font>

132
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">visible on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> orcas first of this year we</font>

133
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,920
then looked at it more closely<font color="#E5E5E5"> France</font>

134
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:41,010
215 of them in ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> NCC administered</font>

ranges 14 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron's raging ranges</font>

136
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,420
looking further we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> went to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

138
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:55,530
old files there and found it there was

139
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,530
some data available for 214 of them

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven a SS not in this for 36 were aces</font>

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,450
outside any range by any of the RRS and

142
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,590
this is a man problem in the

143

158
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:10,320
isn't there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two tower two curves</font>

159

here a science which is in blue and in

and in purple and actually actual use so

injuries or inside the report in red and

162

notice there is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the increase in</font>

176
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,990
actual scene on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nets is sort of back</font>

to the rates before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet bubble</font>

178
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:17,290
while the rates which which things are

179
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,700
assigned is still much higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

180
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,520
before the start of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet bubble</font>

181
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,060
so what presumably is happening here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

182
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:28,329
that people making plans still continue

183
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make plans and get a SS assigned</font>

184
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,970
based on on those plans but in practice

185
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:38,370
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of these plans</font>

186
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:40,350
never make it to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to reality the</font>

187
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:44,310
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is because its faults were</font>

188
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">dear friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before 1999 getting</font>

constant number of a SS missing action

190
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:57,839
since 1999 it's starting to diverge next

191
00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:00,870
thing is is this what what kind of

192
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,050
growth model is here and I've been

193
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the essentially the blue</font>

194
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:11,849
curve so the rate the growth of the

195
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:15,209
assigns a s numbers I did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

196
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:20,129
tests first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to feed them to</font>

197
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:24,569
linear and exponential curves and on the

198
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:27,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">next spot yep there you go you see the</font>

199
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:31,439
data points in rats you see the solid

200
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,870
line for a linear fit and a dotted line

201
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:36,709
for an exponential fits and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

202
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,089
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last two and a half years and</font>

203
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:42,559
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is that the linear fit</font>

204
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:45,120
describes the data the best the

205
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,250
exponential fits does sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

206
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,100
middle but if you look at about the high

207
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:56,930
end and the low<font color="#CCCCCC"> end it starts to diverge</font>

208
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,930
so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

209
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:05,090
so this indicates the near growth and

210
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:08,030
another thing is you can look at is

211
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:10,740
derivatives<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of a sign / months</font>

212
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:14,790
if this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an extra mental curve</font>

213
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:17,190
it would row well it doesn't so contrary

214
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,410
to for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the Jeff result Jeff's</font>

215
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,570
results and there are some small

216
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,850
different more small difference in what

217
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:31,880
we actually did we seem to believe that

218
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:33,870
this is still linear growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

219
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:38,790
looking at the growth rates in more

220
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:41,150
detail this number is is in a plot shows

221
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:47,120
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a scientist as per month</font>

222
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:53,699
in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> red is what's new newly allocated</font>

223
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:57,300
and you see it fluctuated bits in the

224
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,920
beginning sort of 2001 2002 regions and

225
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,920
for the last couple of years it has been

226
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,339
fairly constant a few to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average</font>

227
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,780
it's about 294 plus or minus 43 at new

228
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:13,200
allocations / months at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time a</font>

229
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,500
SS disappear so they're used as they

230
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't show up in the tables anymore and</font>

231
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,890
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also constant for</font>

232
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:26,459
the for the last three three or four

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's on the next slide this is a plot</font>

237
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,510
for all the registries you can also

238
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:46,800
split it up / registry so let's first do

239
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:50,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin and here you see three</font>

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:54,920
curves and in Reds you see new

241
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:58,890
assignments per month in green you see

242
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,170
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> + reassignments so a new assignment</font>

243
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,240
is an AS that's being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

252
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:38,160
around 15 months and then since the

253
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,640
start of 2005 you see that the blue

254
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:47,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">destroyed the green and the red curves</font>

255

recovered to being reassigned secondary

00:14:53,130 --> 00:15:00,000
can look at is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dry pan cici's area</font>

258
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:03,569
same plots however you see that there's

259
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">very little recovery and you also see</font>

260
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in this region the rate seems to</font>

261
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:14,490
increase where it was pretty flat in

262
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,050
where the total is pretty flat and the

263
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:21,270
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the total is pretty flat is</font>

264
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:23,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is recovering now you can</font>

265
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,560
also make these plots for you for the

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">three other registries splits a shot</font>

267
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,060
which they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you a much interesting</font>

268
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:38,430
export this fraction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a SS scene so</font>

269
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:42,829
this is over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time a SS scene 4 divided</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">by a SS and science various cases</font>

271
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:48,690
without going into detail you see that

272
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:55,920
has been stable around sat around 62 63

273
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:59,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent's since 2001 and yeah that's</font>

274
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,449
about all you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this plot</font>

275
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:08,090
so a SS you don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the internet on</font>

276
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:11,319
august first thirty two thousand eight

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:21,740
the net and of the twelve thousand seven

280
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,630
thousand were signs but never used and

point but we retired so if you then look

283

at those five thousand retire de esas

284
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:38,780
and you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hej had so date of</font>

285
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:40,520
assignments and start to show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

286
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,819
the last day it's seen that they were

287
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:47,329
seen on the nets what you see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is</font>

288
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:50,840
a peek basically people use a SS for a

289
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:54,710
couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scale is a month or</font>

290
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:58,850
50 months about four years and after

291
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:01,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS disappear so people use an</font>

292
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:06,620
Aes for a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> then return it</font>

293
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:09,680
another way to look at it is we've you

294
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,939
know a SS which are still active over

295
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:21,380
time so this plot shows since<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1990</font>

296
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:23,060
tilled up to 2005 the number of a SS

297
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,860
which are still active divided by the

298
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,399
number of a SS that were still assigns

299
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:31,459
and what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see is that and if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

300
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:36,290
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right hand side of the</font>

301
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:39,650
plots about eighty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> well of das</font>

302
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,080
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned in 2004 is active and if you</font>

303
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,530
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the left so go back into time</font>

304
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,990
it drops for example they asses which

305
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:53,450
were assigned 10 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago only forty</font>

306
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:56,480
percent is still being used and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font>

307
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,420
you go back more than than than<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

308
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,640
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fluctuations are quite large</font>

309
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,010
but this is mainly due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cutest</font>

310
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,800
attest Ock's pure<font color="#E5E5E5"> viewers a SS were</font>

311
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,270
assigned in those days so one a s

312
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,780
already makes it makes you use

313
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,780
difference

314
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:19,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay continuing so why does why do we</font>

315
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,370
see this behavior well we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

316
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:28,110
our two effects first thing is that

317
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:30,059
sites go out of business now if you've

318
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,719
cited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the go out of business and</font>

319
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're cleaning up the networks and all</font>

320
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,340
the engineers are brushing up their CVS

321
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,470
and trying to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> another job well</font>

322
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,549
there's little incentive to return

323
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:46,169
induced resource and who cares you're

324
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to fight you're trying to get out</font>

325
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:55,380
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there also the rears are not actively</font>

326
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:59,760
recovering those a SS second effect is

327
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:02,419
that networks then to merge small ISPs

328
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,490
are being bought by bigger ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece and</font>

329
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:07,950
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while short while after the</font>

330
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,549
takeover the ug starts to combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

331
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:15,539
networks and when that happens to need

332
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:17,820
for 1a is disappears but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

333
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,440
already member of there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> AR there's</font>

334
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,830
no financial incentive for them to

335
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,990
return to induce de esas so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

336
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:30,770
keep it and EAS is no longer his<font color="#E5E5E5"> bond</font>

337
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Annette's so this is why ASO disappear</font>

338
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:39,750
the other thing is is activation people

339
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:41,669
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ras s based on on plants and they</font>

340
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,740
are signed on Sunday and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can compare</font>

341
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:46,620
the assignment date which the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

342
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:51,630
that's a appear on the net and this is a

343
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:54,239
plot forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> data from 2004 it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a red</font>

344
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,280
green purple and blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four</font>

345
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,080
registries which were activated<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's</font>

346
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:04,740
time and what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is on on the</font>

347
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">x-axis is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the is number of days and on</font>

348
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> y-axis is the fraction of a SS that</font>

349
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:11,668
have been assigned which is actually

350
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:17,159
visible and what you see that after

351
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:20,740
about a month well for about forty

352
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:23,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of the assigned a SS appear</font>

353
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:28,929
he waits about three months or 90 days

354
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:32,110
it's roughly two out of three<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

355
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:33,940
wait a long time I mean say 250 days

356
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:38,229
three of the days you see that the curve

357
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,970
starts to flatten off so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

358
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">flattened us off at about eighty percent</font>

359
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,090
in other words one out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> five aassists</font>

360
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:49,630
which is assigned never appears on the

361
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:52,659
net or at least not within it within a

362
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:55,260
year or two years time and you can make

363
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:01,800
these plots for 40 years as well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

364
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:01,800
still look pretty much the same so

365
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:12,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's happening here okay well there</font>

366
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some policies behind this aaron has</font>

367
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,210
a policy that there must be plans to use

368
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,689
an AS within 30 days after the

369
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:24,160
assignments and that's a criterium which

370
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:27,309
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually used to assign one ripe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ncc</font>

371
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,260
region<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no no policy however</font>

372
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:31,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was a discussion on on one of the</font>

373
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,460
policy meaningless there and people

374
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,340
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's reasonable that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an a as</font>

375
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:40,090
it appears within three months after

376
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:44,320
assignments so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory in</font>

377
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:46,990
practice it doesn't happen it's 40s is

378
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,710
that that appears it takes considerably

379
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:55,080
longer I mean sixty percent has made it

380
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:58,210
for the air in 30 days one out of three

381
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">esme doesn't make the track three months</font>

382
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:10,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">criterion from dr region what okay sure</font>

383
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,309
so and finally twenty percent never

384
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,360
appears even though there was a

385
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:19,300
demonstrated needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's model is a</font>

386
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,979
bit so the first question people ask is

387
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:26,379
when will the a is run out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 16-bit</font>

388
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:28,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">ASNs so we have 64,000 available we sign</font>

389
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:32,029
a thirty-two thirty-three thousand for

390
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">signs and we assign 208</font>

391
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:37,070
per month<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in and we</font>

392
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:40,478
assume our model of linear growth<font color="#CCCCCC"> / 0</font>

393
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:44,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">knots in about 8 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years which is</font>

394
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:46,820
2013 2 2016 obviously if you put in

395
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:50,209
Jeff's model of exponential growth it

396
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:54,139
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit shorter can we make</font>

397
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:57,619
this last longer sure first thing is we

398
00:22:54,139 --> 00:23:01,609
reclaim and reassign what disappears we

399
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:04,249
do that we're down to 179 assignments

400
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:07,070
per month<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're sort of looking at</font>

401
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:11,359
the 2020 range couple of those mines a

402
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:13,189
couple of years and finally we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

403
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,978
reclaim what's the signed but it's not

404
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:19,700
being used you're down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 160 or months</font>

405
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:22,460
and advise you well gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

406
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,789
another eight years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

407
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:28,059
at 23 years from now so yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can make</font>

408
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:31,879
it last longer if we would all become

409
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:33,559
responsible net netizens<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course you</font>

410
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:36,399
can make the pool last a million years

411
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:42,139
if you go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 by day as numbers and</font>

412
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:46,039
Jeff discussed that but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

413
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:49,039
do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the pool last longer well</font>

414
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:51,679
make policy changes current policies are

415
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,809
based on demonstrated needs only

416
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,479
sixty-three percent is actively used

417
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:58,580
twenty percent never makes it so

418
00:23:56,479 --> 00:24:01,279
probably it's too easy to demonstrate

419
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,080
the needs and one thing the policy

420
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,299
working groups after our eyes can do is

421
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:11,109
revisit policies and make the criteria

422
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:14,418
bit tighter next thing you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

423
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:17,689
reclaim unused resources now reclaiming

424
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:20,359
it is kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard since uniqueness is</font>

425
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:23,659
essential in this game<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what will</font>

been no good mechanism for recovery but

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are efforts in the AP Nick and</font>

it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer well</font>

441
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:08,418
know if if you renew it you don't need

442
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:12,289
to renumber and if you put if you don't

443
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:17,749
renew it the certificate expires and the

444
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:19,639
resource can be reused this will people

445
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:22,879
doing pairing and setting up routings to

446
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:24,758
check that their certificate is actually

447
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:27,109
valid but this is something that's

448
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,989
expected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become standard practice for</font>

449
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:34,728
securing the routing system anyway so

450
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:42,349
yes you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it last longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

will you go for telecom Hank looking at

00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:12,478
the not used numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> while okay we are</font>

477
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:26,159
decided wisely that while okay numbers

478
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:28,469
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be given out to people who had at</font>

479
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:32,940
that time actually no hope of connecting

480
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:36,179
somewhere and keeping the uniqueness

481
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,009
there these<font color="#E5E5E5"> days I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are</font>

482
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,859
people who do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to actually</font>

483
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:42,690
connect somewhere but actually but

484
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:47,309
actually are forming their separate

485
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:50,929
clubs using these resources and I'm not

486
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:53,749
quite sure whether our policies are

487
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:57,200
allowing them to use the resources and

488
00:27:53,749 --> 00:28:00,929
whether the policies should allow them

489
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:06,479
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if there is any use like</font>

490
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:08,729
that happening that use might be

491
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:10,889
actually an interesting factor for

492
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:16,789
becoming of a development and the growth

493
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:20,399
of consumption yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I mean one</font>

494
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:22,408
obvious answer is that some most of

495
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:28,408
these applications can be done with

496
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:32,489
using private<font color="#CCCCCC"> oasis and the second thing</font>

497
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:35,249
is as far as I'm aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the policies</font>

498
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:36,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">are required at the things your net</font>

499
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:39,269
should be connected to the public

500
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:43,619
internet right and that's that's the

501
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:45,899
current policy I mean it's very likely I

502
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:48,599
didn't do any history historic research

503
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:51,149
on this that it might have been

504
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:54,570
different in the past but then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

505
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:59,268
very very few were were assigned back in

00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:01,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">those days well haven't there been</font>

507
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:04,529

509
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:09,180
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get unique resources being IPL</font>

510
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:11,370
for addresses or a

511
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:15,090
numbers and they were advised to use

512
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:17,760
actually the existing registry framework

513
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:22,139
and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there is some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good reason</font>

514
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:25,129
not to touch not to use private<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

515
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,620
numbers where you are actually are

516
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:33,240
targeting targeting a system that is

517
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:35,879
open in some sense now well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay using a</font>

518
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,460
private using private numbers within the

519
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate space that I actually think</font>

520
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,460
I'm controlling is something very

521
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:47,639
different from using private number

522
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,770
space within an industry where obviously

523
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:58,020
no party can exercise control about the

524
00:29:52,770 --> 00:30:00,440
other part is joining<font color="#E5E5E5"> through yeah right</font>

it Tony<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tauber currently with comcast</font>

526
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,790
just to clarify or elaborate I think

527
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,310
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> uniqueness that's important and</font>

528
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,780
even if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not touching the public</font>

529
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:13,409
internet if they start to touch each

530
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:17,220
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if some people here haven't</font>

their life that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them but I'm</font>

533
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,670
sure it's probably just a matter of time

534
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two two entities which thought</font>

535
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,750
they'd never touch anything else that

536
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,100
would matter you know just took<font color="#CCCCCC"> it upon</font>

537
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,480
themselves to use their private address

538
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,310
space and do what they wanted and then

539
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,860
you know they have to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other</font>

540
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:39,230
that's a problem you know the same holds

541
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,229
true for private address space so

543
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:56,330
the other day um I was studying route to

544
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,220
use data and I'm found weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

545
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:05,899
behavior and it turned out that Heron

546
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:09,050
has started recycling<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS numbers um I'd</font>

547
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,970
be interested you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there it would be</font>

548
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:14,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">very helpful for us who are studying</font>

549
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:18,700
these data if the registries could tell

550
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:24,560
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not they are recycling and</font>

551
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:29,210
could make available the activity

552
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:33,260
periods of an AAS in other words a s 666

553
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:38,360
had a life from A to B and a new life

554
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:40,760
from f2q um it gets pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprising</font>

555
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,760
also it would be interesting to know if

556
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,170
they're significant benefit in this you

557
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,350
know are you really recovering much

558
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:50,450
space is it worth it will it extend

559
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,520
things from you know october fourteenth

560
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:57,950
to the 16th or will it extend it three

561
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:59,960
years well okay so for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rep speaking</font>

562
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,970
for the ripe NCC I mean we have to data

563
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,050
so we can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it available and I see</font>

564
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:10,960
Aaron running up to the microphone

565
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:14,030
Leslie so I mean we have the data yeah

566
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,680
anyway Leslie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nabil with Aaron we have</font>

567
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,379
actually started recurrent claiming a

568
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,870
lot of autonomous system numbers due to

569
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,550
non-payment and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data i'm</font>

570
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,889
talking about it later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in the week at</font>

571
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:28,010
our meeting but we've gotten the past

572
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,170
six months we've reclaimed 461<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs I</font>

573
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,180
wish we are starting to recycle them we

574
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,880
hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> them for a year and then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

575
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:39,260
using them so i'll publish some stats on

576
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,220
that at some point yeah so and the other

577
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:45,980
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can just show the plots I</font>

578
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:49,860
mean if you reclaim what disappears I

579
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:55,750
mean it buys you a couple of years which

580
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:57,669
it's and it it's I mean the problem that

581
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,470
that we have to deploy find another

582
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:01,890
solution does not disappear just price

583
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,890
is fine
