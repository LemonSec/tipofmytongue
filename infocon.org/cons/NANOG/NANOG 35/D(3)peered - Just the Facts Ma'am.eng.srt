based on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the early feedback I've</font>

received in the hallways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as a</font>

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,830

large group of people are not going to

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,530
to focus at least a little bit if you

24
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,408
can on the actual routing impact of this

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,590

147
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,510
from level three<font color="#E5E5E5"> having solved some</font>

148
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,810
in the meantime and we'll look at what

149
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">those were and level 3 regain almost the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">be expected here's a graph of that event</font>

153
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,780
and you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> some features of that</font>

154
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,910
the green<font color="#CCCCCC"> is 3356 level 3 in the red is</font>

155
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,979
cogent they started roughly the same

156
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,110
sort of bloated unnecessarily d

157
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:53,220
aggregated routing table right up there

158
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,780
where you would expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to be and you</font>

159
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,490
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the traffic if you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

161
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,800
out from what I hear and so so 3356

162
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,090
drops down<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and they stay flat and</font>

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">then they come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back up and they're back</font>

164
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,340
up to where that that that's normal

165

167
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,610
is sort of interesting shenanigans that

168
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,200
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

169
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,380

170
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,270
sure what that's about so what came back

171
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,610
in the interim for coaching the big deal

172
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:29,180

sort of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened and why they</font>

during the outage period level 3 in

187

cogent each carried routes for the other

188
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,400
so so things were leaked and now's a

189
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,320
good time to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was leaked</font>

190
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,729
and who did the leaking and it was a

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,790
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought it would</font>

192
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,440
so who were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> leakers to level 3 level</font>

193
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">3 carried a total of thirty seven</font>

194
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,800
prefixes that had 174 routes will tell

195
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,300
was the biggest leaker with<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost a</font>

196
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,070
majority of those and we'll look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

197
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,810
few paths just to see what those look

198
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:36,510
like cogent carried 134 level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

199
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:38,760
rounds and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest leaker there was</font>

200
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,189
reach tell globe had a little

201
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,400
but very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot a tiny bit and then it's</font>

202
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,130
sort of down in the noise there so

203
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,600
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sample paths that we see and</font>

204
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are paths I should emphasize these</font>

205
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,320
are announcements that we see in routing

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,900
tables during the partitioning event so

207
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,790
you see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know here's a cogent</font>

208
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,040
somebody leaks it to you you net units

209
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,079
leaks it to level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 or somebody leaks it</font>

210
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,770
to you know in this case will tell will

211
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,980
tell leaks it to level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 so um I this is</font>

212
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,710
and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> not shocking but a little</font>

213
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,660
bit larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree of leakage and more</font>

214
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,520
widespread than I would expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

215
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,130
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can sort of make</font>

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of three particular people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

wonderful experience it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit and so there's a lot</font>

221
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,430
of there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more routing</font>

222
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,920
configuration work that needs to be done

223
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,099
at some large I asses so who are the

224
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,189
winners who got the previously you know

225
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,500
the previously routed through this edge

226
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,530
if you consider the edge between those

227
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,450
two a SS between 174 and 3356 that

228
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,520
carried some multi home traffic who got

229
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,530
those well there's not actually all that

230
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,720
interesting a story to tell with regard

231
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,760
to level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three a bunch of other big a s</font>

232
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,420
has picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up those paths and that's as</font>

233
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,300
you would expect it the 3356 previous

234
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,490
routes to cogent vast majority went

235
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,920
through very oh and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

236
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,620
as the road runner<font color="#CCCCCC"> passed the 8th edn</font>

237
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,599
very a roadrunner path it really tells

238
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,610
the bulk of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> story so you may say to</font>

239
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,410
yourselves and we I have heard publicly

240
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,450
on the list these people are just fools

241
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">these non single home these single homes</font>

242
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,500
a esas they get what they pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and</font>

243
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be right but there are some</font>

244
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,000
some fairly prominent fools who didn't

245
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,090
have the redundancy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they may have</font>

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,130
expected and so I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to be</font>

247
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,530
sort of superior sounding and saying all

248
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,120
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

249
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,620
but it's also important to know what the

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,030
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and who's being</font>

251
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,030
harmed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so here are some</font>

252
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:48,180
examples i mean the level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 are cogent</font>

253
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,350
is not publicly known to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

254
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,400
provider to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the financial services</font>

255
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,750
sector but there

256
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,000
were a number of but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font>

257
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,650
of big financial services companies who

258
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,220
show up behind cogent who were single

259
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,110
home behind cogent during this event

260
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,850
same thing level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three you know had had</font>

261
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,290
quite a few a general services

262
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,500
administration department of health and

263
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:14,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">human services tiaa-cref these are sort</font>

264
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:18,840
of non trivial things so during the

265
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:21,030
outage as I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1298 previously</font>

266
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,270
single homes prefixes behind level

267
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">through regained connectivity to cogent</font>

268
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,710
largely because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the 761 Roadrunner</font>

269
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,080
prefixes a hundred and<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty-two</font>

270
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,760
previously single home to prefixes

271
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,870
behind cogent regained any connectivity

272
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,420
to level three so the the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

273
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,250
prefixes lost by cogent was larger the

274
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,680
repair effort on their part during the

275
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,540
event was also more effective and larger

276
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,489
so some quick summary conclusions here

277
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,230
this was not a catastrophe for our

278
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,440
industry of course but it was

279
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,630
significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4.3 percent of you know the</font>

280
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,880
prefixes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are normally routed in the</font>

281
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,620
existing bloated global tables were

282
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,410
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this and about one percent</font>

283
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of globally visible a SS were affected</font>

284
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,459
directly the leaking is a little bit

285
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">more interesting part of the story that</font>

286
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was surprised that before Eileen and I</font>

287
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,479
started looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this leaking wasn't</font>

288
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,860
something we expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on lots</font>

289
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,740
of networks are not filtering their

290
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,600
customers lots of networks are not

291
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,400
nobody's filtering their peers and most

292
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,470
of the smaller networks aren't correctly

293
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,510
filtering their providers so there's a

294
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,590
lot of there's a lot of work to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done</font>

295
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,730
there a few creative fixes as we mix and

296
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,050
November night this is coming up it's

297
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,450
right around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner and there's</font>

298
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,599
there's fun to be had so this is more

299
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sort of to whet your appetite and</font>

300
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,530
stay tuned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this station thanks very</font>

301
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,530
much in some technical credits

302
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,850
any questions

303
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:05,089
d AOL how are you reaching the

304
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,189
conclusion that significant portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

305
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,069
Road Runner was single<font color="#E5E5E5"> II don't that it</font>

306
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:12,349
dropped coincident with the deep hearing

307
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:15,199
well when you mean drop you mean they

308
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:19,209
were not reachable from cogent exactly

309
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:21,290
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now the correct answer is</font>

310
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,969
technically from a rotting perspective

311
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,368
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> single home but they were</font>

312
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,019
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not single home from a physical</font>

313
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:33,410
perspective they were multihomed and

314
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:37,100
there was a local<font color="#CCCCCC"> debriefing going on in</font>

315
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:39,618
between 8th edn and cogent so that

316
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,809
suppress the pads because Gordon was not

317
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,610
taking the level three pads were winning

318
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,868
out over day-to-day and pads in various

319
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,299
Network and they were not being

320
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:49,879
propagated to cogent<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so from</font>

321
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:52,970
various perspective it was multihomed

322
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:54,290
but from a audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective due to</font>

323
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,679
the filtering policies applied at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

324
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,899
edge they were single<font color="#E5E5E5"> account that's</font>

325
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,399
interesting thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick question</font>

326
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">on some of the folks who are lost like</font>

327
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,980
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSA and and seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam and whomever</font>

328
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:08,839
else those are just folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

329
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,910
autonomous systems correct I mean there

330
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,069
could be lots of other statically routed

331
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,559
folks absolutely absolutely you got it

332
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:18,559
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta hope for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm just</font>

333
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,449
surprised to see folks evidently talking

334
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,868
bgp butter single home<font color="#E5E5E5"> damier these</font>

335
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:25,758
routing policy issues or any idea what's

336
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:27,949
going on there I don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean my</font>

337
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,540
suspicion is that although this you know

338
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:31,519
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roadrunner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

339
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,589
obviously complicated and interesting

340
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,910
from an engineering perspective my

341
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,670
suspicion is that at a high level

342
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,529
there's got to be people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have some</font>

343
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,748
sort of cold failover in place which are

344
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:43,669
either configuration errors or

345
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:45,559
configuration choices that the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

346
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:47,509
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really deep ref one of your</font>

347
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,368
providers is to not announce your routes

348
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:50,480
out it unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I'm</font>

349
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:51,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wonder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's anyone out here</font>

350
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,110
who can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment on one of these</font>

351
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:57,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">cities might be nearby</font>

352
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,900
so I happen to represent one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

353
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,300
actually was on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> page I won't</font>

354
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,670
suspect so i have to mention which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

355
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,099
s that was lost was a small dead data

356
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,229
center<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> London that is single home</font>

357
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,180
but it's fairly insignificant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

358
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,790
overall business most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do</font>

359
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:17,709
comes out of a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> locations in the</font>

360
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:20,110
US<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very much multihomed so Todd would</font>

361
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:24,280
you say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a classic game of</font>

362
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:26,620
chicken and if so which side do you

363
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,720
think blinks first you indicate the

364
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,840
number of routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to be twice as</font>

365
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,870
many prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> level-three had as</font>

366
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:38,350
compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cochin so in this case this</font>

367
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:41,020
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big player that is twice as</font>

368
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:47,980
strong and powerful or or all routes not

369
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:49,329
created equal well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm against my better</font>

370
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:54,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">judgement I'll comment on those</font>

371
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:56,590
questions so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people lie about</font>

372
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,180
their traffic and and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously none</font>

373
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,440
of us really knows most people don't

374
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much traffic is on their own</font>

375
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,620
networks and none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us really knows how</font>

376
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,619
much traffic is on coaching or level

377
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,000
threes network<font color="#CCCCCC"> um they are you know</font>

378
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,880
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three is obviously the older</font>

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,730
bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> network in some sense but by</font>

380
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,860
virtue of selling transit in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

381
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,160
markets as cheaply as they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> cochin is</font>

382
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,260
the preferred bulk volume provider for

383
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,740
many many of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

384
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:26,260
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a large multihomed mostly</font>

385
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,760
multihomed customer base who prefers you

386
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,589
because you're cheaper then a couple

387
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">things happened one is that you're</font>

388
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,540
likely to get more traffic per customer

389
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,860
than you would if you cost more that

390
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,740
doesn't mean more dollars but it doesn't

391
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,170
mean more traffic the second thing is

392
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,450
your customers may be more tolerant of

393
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,860
these sorts of network partitioning

394
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,740
errors than people who either pay you

395
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,410
more or who for whom you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a more</font>

396
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,150
important provider and I think that yeah

397
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,069
it's again all<font color="#CCCCCC"> deep hearings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a game</font>

398
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,900
of chicken and this one just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got played</font>

399
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,510
out a little bit more publicly and this

400
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,339
is not I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably the tenth</font>

401
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,680
or fifteenth interesting deep<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing</font>

402
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,050
that's happened this calendar year so

403
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,030
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> why this one got as much public</font>

404
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,069
attention

405
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,230
a little bit unclear about and mystified

406
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,780
about but yeah I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it is a game</font>

407
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of chicken there are steaks the number</font>

408
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:20,730
of prefixes is not just the issue if if

409
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,859
I ask PA well if I SPC has a customer

410
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,660
base that's happy buying you know

411
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-eight percent of the internet and</font>

412
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,430
is willing to pay ten dollars a megabit

413
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:31,199
to do that and I sp3 does not have a

414
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:35,280
customer base that's willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

415
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,990
then in a deep hearing event is<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC has a</font>

416
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,230
lot of leverage and they can survive a

417
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,360
lot longer the other thing that comes up

418
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,370
has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of pain that both</font>

419
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,399
parties felt of course there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way</font>

420
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,989
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but that's</font>

421
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,040
part of the the interesting thing about

422
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:55,860
this is my experience looking at past

423
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,360
deep earrings is that actually there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

424
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,370
a great deal of pain to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be spread across</font>

425
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,260
all customers on both sides of this

426
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,300
situation particularly as things like

427
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,300
voice over IP and other services at

428
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,730
folks kind of expect to just work kick

429
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:14,220
in so I'm hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nothing happens on</font>

430
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that November date good luck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with all</font>

431
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,779
that let me come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

432
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,510
let me comment on the voice of our IP

433
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:24,510
thing most partitioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> zuv voice over</font>

434
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,370
IP stuff don't happen when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper</font>

435
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,899
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally your provider that</font>

436
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,418
you're connecting to for termination

437
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,949
origination of voice over IP and the

438
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,570
provider you already have a business

439
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,330
relationship with embroidered in your

440
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,580
voice over IP service contract so this

441
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,928
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice of a right be partitioning</font>

442
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe is a little bit of a red</font>

443
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:47,970
herring and not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we really</font>

444
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:50,070
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be worried about oh except for</font>

445
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,460
the million vonage customers and I

446
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,500
oppressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> MCI but it yeah right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

447
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are those million folks but</font>

448
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,279
there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 10 million MCI</font>

449
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,929
advantage customers i'm certain that

450
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,620
weren't affected no we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

451
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:06,510
anything somebody just wasted not me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

452
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,979
was going to say that some of the folks

453
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,539
that look like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home the</font>

454
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,220
reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have bgp might be that</font>

455
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,039
they have multiple sites inside of the

456
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:17,250
network so some of our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

457
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,870
they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi homes but they you</font>

458
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,850
thrown a s have multiple connections or

459
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,840
multiple multiple sites so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sure that</font>

460
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,639
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an artifact for that sure</font>

461
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,740
that's an interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> point to pick up</font>

462
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,919
those back to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sort of brief</font>

463
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,950
common is that Chris is the vonage

464
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,630
customers are effectively or many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

465
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,490
them are effectively single homes behind

466
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,460
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three for at least part of that</font>

467
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">vonage service and that may be why this</font>

468
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,770
got the politicals think that it did I'm

469
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,770
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

470
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,520
that I'm sorry

471
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,929
I'm not a hundred percent certain but I

472
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,880
know of an interface that connects the

473
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:04,270
vonage that gets lots and lots and lots

474
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,039
of really small packets it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a level</font>

475
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">threes network so i think that they</font>

476
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,908
spread that around as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that</font>

477
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,919
because I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what wait centres and</font>

478
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:14,799
bids they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> God I mean what you</font>

479
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,990
partition the the service area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to</font>

480
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,279
various did various rate centers and

481
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,230
then some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are on some providers</font>

482
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,909
and some of them are and others sure and

483
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,309
yeah my particular comment about the

484
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:26,380
million customers I think we'll go back

485
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:28,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">to Vijay and Roadrunner right some</font>

486
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,100
roadrunner customers or other cable and

487
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:33,459
DSL people might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been partitioned</font>

488
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:36,270
from from vonage potentially or from

489
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,950
their other provider like name the other

490
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,240
16,000 vonage ish like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

491
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,940
