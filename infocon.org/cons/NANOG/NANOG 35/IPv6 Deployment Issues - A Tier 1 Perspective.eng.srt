that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a good start first of all</font>

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,929
I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out i'm not an ipv6</font>

expert I've spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> many years in the RPV</font>

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,948
for world like the rest of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,529
is kind of something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I threw</font>

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,640
together because a lot of people are

8
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,099
going to be experiencing this in the

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,210
next short time whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may be so</font>

10
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,668
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today isn't</font>

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,280
an in-depth discussion on ipv6 and it's

12
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,629
not an<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument for or against ipv6 or</font>

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,480
all the usual things we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,399
before it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dis look at the some of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three here when we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a the implementation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ipv6</font>

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,579
on our network and some of the things

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,559
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at to get around those</font>

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,789
issues and some of the ongoing issues

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,620
and things that maybe you should be

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,460
aware of if you're thinking about doing

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the future so firstly just a</font>

warehouse in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sentiments of the last</font>

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,730
speaker not that many people in the

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,640
world compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ipv4 world are</font>

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,520
taking up your v6 very seriously

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially in the North America I'm also</font>

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,439
they are in Europe and in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> asia-pac so</font>

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,960
if you have a look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main jana</font>

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,059
allocations of v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> space it's interesting</font>

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you compare it to the v4</font>

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,280
space there's an awful lot sign to APNIC

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,740
and ripe and has<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in use and not</font>

36
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,850
is changing soon so sure North America

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,470
isn't really looking at it in any great

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,710
depth but other place in world are

39
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,850
looking at it and they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it and</font>

40
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,149
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an increase in customer</font>

41
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,439
requests for ipv6 that definitely we're

42
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,270
seeing and i'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that other</font>

43
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,860
people are beginning to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it</font>

44
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't the someone come along and saying</font>

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">i went 240 gig of ipv6 connectivity</font>

46
00:01:53,509 --> 00:02:00,380
might just be part of a bid that goes

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:05,369
with v4 and as policies the politicians

48
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,780
make their presence known ipv6 will and

49
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,959
it is becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a part of</font>

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,360
publicly funded bids especially in the

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,770
EU now and will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the u.s.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure</font>

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,230
all aware of that so looking the actual

53
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,970
problems in deploying ipv6 there are

54
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,130
four main issues that tend to hinder the

55
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,100
IC first one is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the</font>

56
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision that's a huge one and not</font>

57
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that engineers can actually</font>

58
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,160
push managers very well then there's a

59
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,420
network natural network itself so the

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology of actually getting v6</font>

61
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,679
running on your network there's the

62
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,630
people and politics<font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind of goes</font>

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,860
with the decision making<font color="#E5E5E5"> but slightly</font>

64
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,470
different issue you more or to do with

65
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,130
acceptance of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

66
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,510
there's a systems which probably is the

67
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,040
most forgotten thing until you actually

68
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:55,109
hit the problems so making the decision

69
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,239
sure there's a there's a lot of lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

70
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,370
desire to actually move towards ipv6 and

71
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,200
you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been guilty in</font>

72
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,610
that over the years and whether it is

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going to be used in any great</font>

74
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,959
scale or not in the future who knows but

75
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,049
it does seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be taking on a bit now</font>

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,000
so people seem to be being pushed more

77
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,650
by customer requirements than by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,930
actual desire themselves to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move towards</font>

79
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,370
ipv6 again because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these publicly</font>

80
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,220
funded projects and things that where

81
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,739
they say you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap for</font>

82
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,750
ipv6 or you must include some ipv6

83
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,549
facility on your network however the

84
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,220
traffic volumes<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really not that high</font>

85
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,019
compared to ipv4 I mean they're getting

86
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,980
there but they're they're still not that

87
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,480
high and therefore the key point here is

88
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,820
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> much associated revenue with</font>

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,130
this traffic and therefore it's

90
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,829
difficult to justify an awful lot of

91
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,620
expenditure because of that so the

92
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,610
network itself to main implementation

93
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,000
rules first of all don't break the ipv4

94
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">network when you're implementing this I</font>

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">break it for other reasons but you know</font>

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,280
not because of ipv6 and don't spend much

97
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,980
money because there isn't much

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,019
associated revenue so if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> along to</font>

99
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,420
your manager and say hey I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

100
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,880
out v6 give us five billion dollars and

101
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,910
I'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do it they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

102
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,930
go for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so don't break the v4</font>

103
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,269
network I think a status a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

104
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,978
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us are in now is that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

105
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tv6 functionality for the</font>

106
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and we need to have it in the</font>

107
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,530
toolbox but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't necessarily need it</font>

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,219
everywhere

109
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,380
point now at all knows it mustn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect</font>

110
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> V full functionality so you know you</font>

111
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,139
roll out v6 and break the v4 network

112
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,639
you're not going to have a nice day not

113
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,090
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kits out there on most people's</font>

114
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,370
networks support v6 they either don't

115
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,570
support it at all or they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

116
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,460
it very well so there's an awful lot

117
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,620
akin out there for instance process

118
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,489
which is v six packets in a really ugly

119
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,380
manner so you don't need to have v6

120
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,210
functionality on every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single box you</font>

121
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,340
just need it on a geographical<font color="#CCCCCC"> as-needed</font>

122
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">basis so you want to have the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

123
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,599
someone comes along<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you and says I</font>

124
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,910
want this much before in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this city oh</font>

125
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also want v6 connectivity you know</font>

126
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,860
how are you going to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

127
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,650
other rule don't spend much money so

128
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,300
really really difficult to justify any

129
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,219
large capital expenditure on ipv6

130
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,870
because the return on investment just

131
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,330
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good in the short term</font>

132
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,540
and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are working on a 10-year</font>

133
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,099
return i'm sure the increase in

134
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,050
operating expenditure also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

135
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,820
considered so there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

136
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,860
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you'll end up spending</font>

137
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,250
money on the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the software</font>

138
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,500
support and all things like that now the

139
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">next time you not being able to support</font>

140
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,890
ipv6 on an entire global to learn it

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,340
work well I know there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

142
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on that but it is a big problem</font>

143
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,289
i mean it's it's not something that's

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to roll out overnight so 14 v6</font>

145
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:52,890
when you've got tens of thousands of

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,750
nodes isn't easy especially when some of

147
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">them don't support v6 or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't do a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the more you look at it</font>

149
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,870
the more costs are when you start

150
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,099
running these sorts of things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,390
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some tier ones are doing this</font>

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,780
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some of them do we have a</font>

please state your name Jared<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch very</font>

oh I'm a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> puzzled by your not</font>

159
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:31,380
now well yeah and and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome for</font>

160
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,700
two or more years well so yeah I'm a

161
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit puzzled by that statement</font>

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">please elaborate on that significantly</font>

163
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,780
more sure there are some terrible

164
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,870
networks and I apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

165
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:46,619
politically charged statement there are

166
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,230
some large<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP networks that do support</font>

167
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,940
v6 now I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure whether they really</font>

168
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">support it native complete end-to-end</font>

169
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,250
whether the whole thing is short sure

170
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,430
some do and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say yes yes</font>

171
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,600
they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay some some do and if you've</font>

172
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,220
managed to roll that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a long</font>

173
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,750
time maybe maybe you were sensible

174
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,000
enough to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this you know many</font>

175
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,260
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago that's great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably can</font>

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,270
my point here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and I'll probably</font>

177
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,180
explain a bit further is that if you've

178
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,650
got a network that is not v6 capable now

179
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,680
and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tier one size network then</font>

180
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,299
rolling v6 across the whole thing now is

181
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be tricky I guess that's</font>

182
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,460
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more clarity if you've</font>

183
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">already done it and you've already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spent</font>

184
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,940
the years getting there yeah you've got

185
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,159
it however if you were if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't</font>

186
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,469
got v6 on the network now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

187
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,810
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a overnight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hey let's go v6</font>

188
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:38,040
everywhere does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of explain</font>

189
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:40,380
that one that helps so much but somewhat

190
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,000
but I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

191
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,150
significant project for someone to go

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,490
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put change their</font>

193
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,620
point-to-point link allocation policies

194
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,020
for internally to put on these six

195
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,370
addresses as well enable the either the

196
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,830
is is extensions for the v6 and stuff or

197
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,020
two if you your network is running ospf

198
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,479
to load the ospfv3 code on there and

199
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,430
that way you get your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP and then you</font>

200
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,880
can set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a separate ibgp mesh for your</font>

201
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,610
v6 transport and v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> NRL I so I can do</font>

202
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same thing on the same equipment and</font>

203
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,450
provide native connectivity instead of

204
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,440
back hauling stuff halfway across the

205
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,780
country or across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> globe as</font>

206
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,140
or demonstrated in traceroute recently

207
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,419
under near novelist<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay two points not</font>

208
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,820
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said not every element of your</font>

209
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">network elements may support v6 so that</font>

210
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a problem and the second point</font>

211
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:44,210
you might say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just turning on and</font>

212
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:46,730
your GP isn't a big deal yeah it is you

213
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,130
know if you say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll we're going to</font>

214
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,530
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on v6 I don't know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font>

215
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">will do for testing but you know I sure</font>

216
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:58,160
won't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and turn on any feature on the</font>

217
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,710
live v4 network that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrying traffic</font>

218
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,199
discerning as money I would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and</font>

219
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,410
turn a new feature on that until it's

220
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">been through an awful lot of regression</font>

221
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,240
testing and that's going to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

222
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then those sorts of bugs so that the</font>

223
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,720
whole point there is that you probably

224
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,790
want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> what from my point of view to</font>

225
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,730
separate them out reduces that issue and

226
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:22,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's what I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go into it</font>

227
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just my perspective that you</font>

228
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,550
know it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that there's a</font>

229
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,280
number of providers that are either

230
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this or have done this in the past</font>

231
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,569
so it seems that the number of

232
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,640
regression type things that you seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

233
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,990
be concerned about well everyone's

234
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,060
network is unique and I'm perfectly

235
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,920
willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to admit that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our network may</font>

236
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,750
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique and not directly comparable to</font>

237
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone else is in the room and I'm sure</font>

238
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,310
that's the case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as well that a</font>

239
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,290
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol things and stuff</font>

240
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,420
have been flushed out in the testing by

241
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:54,770
the vendors at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

242
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,819
significantly stable okay sure yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

243
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,170
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things have been tested by</font>

244
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,020
vendors and then we find problems with

245
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:04,459
it not the vendors ever put bugs in code

246
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,319
now I again it's a point that if you

247
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,670
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> got any v6 on now would you be</font>

248
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,390
happy going around you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning</font>

249
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,650
on v6 on your v4 network without really

250
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,420
thoroughly testing it no matter what the

251
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:19,579
vendors say and you know I wouldn't you

252
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,459
know nasty things happens when you when

253
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,379
you break your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igv so what sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

254
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,209
things did we consider so

255
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,160
as a telecommunications company

256
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,589
considered you know full overlay Network

257
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive a lot of</font>

258
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:37,559
resources in use tunneling yeah kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

259
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,859
sucks really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of manual work doesn't</font>

260
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">really scale very well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a complete IPTV</font>

261
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:44,609
ipv6 network deployment so as I was

262
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,099
saying here not all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kit that you'll</font>

263
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:49,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">have on the network supports ipv6 in</font>

264
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:50,970
hardware or at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'm sure</font>

265
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">we all know the box is that out there</font>

266
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,079
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> x million packets of</font>

267
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,139
v4 you stick v6 in and it it turns out

268
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:00,899
few packets a second you don't want to

269
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:04,919
risk that before never look so you don't

270
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,449
want to bring down v4 by implementing v6

271
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,279
which is functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> that isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

272
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:10,949
going to any much actual revenue<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep</font>

273
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,389
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be bad so if you're going to</font>

274
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:14,279
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

275
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:16,439
start and planting it everywhere you

276
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,789
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge number of different</font>

277
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,559

278
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:21,179
have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different models of load</font>

279
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">from vendors and you can have to redo</font>

280
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:26,249
regression testing for all of those for

281
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:27,779
v6 and even that's difficult to justify

282
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:29,459
you turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the engineering manager</font>

283
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,549
to say hey I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to regression test</font>

284
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:35,728

287
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:42,539
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to cost you know</font>

288
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,499
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in man-hours and lab time and and</font>

289
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,809
then they say well how much is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

290
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:50,159
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn and you sort of go to</font>

292
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:56,129
what do we do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't go</font>

293
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one but we used our existing global</font>

295
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:05,129

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipv6 functionality which</font>

297
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:08,669

00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:16,019
doesn't actually hit the existing v4

301
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:17,459

<font color="#CCCCCC">approach way you can just turn around</font>

303
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:22,738
and say okay we need v6 in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

304
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,879

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,320
it's a very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick recap on 68 it</font>

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,220

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of way we've implemented it you can</font>

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,380
connect servers g6pd devices and connect

native Native either just v6 or dual

324
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,420
stack all we can do it via tunnels and

325
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,089
you can connect the appears and all such

326
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,130
to the 6p devices without all of this

327
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:29,279
without affecting your v4 network and

328
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,520
that's that's kind of the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us so</font>

329
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,810
it's reasonably easy to configure so

330
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,430
from our point of view we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had</font>

331
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,099
the MPLS and I'll do here whatever

332
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,469
functionality so there was no extra

333
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,180
configuration to put on there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

336
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:51,239
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually offer dual stack if you</font>

337
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:53,459
want to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you set up bgp and the</font>

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,800

people again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure getting too used</font>

340

everything running so from our point of

344
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,339
view the advantages of 6pe you need it

345
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,380
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> location you drop in a box it works</font>

346
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,600
it's easy configuration is really quick

you an absolute fortune and all that

353
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,750
traffic's usually hardware process so

354
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,520
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font>

or we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything about 5 make</font>

356

disadvantages well a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

357
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,070
no consider it to be a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hack</font>

358
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,899
still you still haven't got your native

359
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:44,769
network via your ipv6 native networks

360
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:46,509
your core still isn't there not all

361
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:48,660
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> a6p capable so you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

362
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,860
be fairly limited on potentially on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">devices that can actually run as these</font>

364
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:58,029
these points and sure if you need to one

365
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:00,519
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things here is that if you need</font>

big scheme of things there's not a again

369
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,550
there's that some customers asking for

370
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,429
it you're probably going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

371
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:14,349
this on a limited basis and certain

372
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:16,990
specific sites so yeah you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">install any device and also you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

375
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,170
and how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works is as well as how</font>

376
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:26,259
ipv6 works and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole issue in</font>

377
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,209
itself so for us the time scales so we

378
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,040
made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision quite late really in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a shorter timescale because you haven't</font>

got some risk involved and so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

391
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,559
involved in rolling out new confident

392
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,870
code whatever across hundreds of boxes

393
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,480
potentially thousands and it's all

394
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,550
running is expected there's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

395
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,809
low maintenance<font color="#E5E5E5"> overhead very few issues</font>

396
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,120
that we've hit with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was seem</font>

397
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:09,370
to be running quite an evening looking

398
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,709
back I'm at yeah it's been pretty good

399
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,079
we haven't affected the v4 network by

400
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:17,410
doing this v6 stuff has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very</font>

401
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,819
limited expenditure but sure what works

402
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,079
best for us doesn't work necessarily

403
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:22,628
best of other people some people might

404
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a core and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already tested the code</font>

405
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,920
it might just be easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn native</font>

406
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:28,388
v6 on everywhere that's that's fine this

407
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,790
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we saw it and how other</font>

408
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:34,299
people might might benefit from looking

409
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,599
at that so what's next for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us well more</font>

410
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:38,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these 6p devices in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> medium-term</font>

some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> native parent connections</font>

412
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,329
we've got some now but you know we're

413
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:44,618
building on those the big thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

414
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:47,319
educating people on ipv6 within the

415
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:48,910

00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:51,910
know it's difficult to employ people

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,019
with good v4 experience you turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

418
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to know everything</font>

419
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:57,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font>

420
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,579
b6 as well it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be difficult</font>

421
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:01,819
doing billables you'll stack

422
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,920
connectivity to customers that's a

423
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:05,898
systems issue which are coming to a head

424
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,289
and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term going to a native</font>

425
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:11,359
APPL pv6 core maybe at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point maybe</font>

426
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,000
if it starts earning money and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

427
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,188
for him and i might give you six support

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,619
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system sir it's a huge</font>

429
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,520
issue so quick look at the people in

430
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:24,049
politics from the people side of things

431
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,529
people fall into one of the following

432
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:29,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">categories you either have the pro ipv6</font>

433
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:33,140
people tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be engineers we should do</font>

434
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:34,580
v6 you get the anti-v six people again

435
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,250
mostly engineers you say we shouldn't

436
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">leave you sick and you get the accounts</font>

437
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,630
for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care what we do</font>

438
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,120
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me some money yeah just make</font>

439
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:49,010
some profit and then you get the other

440
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,989
one what the hell is v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah what so</font>

441
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,179
winning people over between those

442
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,559
categories is is one of the biggest

443
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:56,779
tasks and possibly the single biggest

444
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,549
task because if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doesn't</font>

445
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:01,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to do b6 it's so much a philosopher</font>

446
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:03,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">Phillip philosophical issue and not a</font>

447
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,918
practical one at the moment then it

448
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:08,750
becomes difficult to win an argument a

449
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:13,130
huge issue training people so you think

450
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of people think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

451
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,679
have to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about v4 now</font>

452
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,658
you're gonna have to train all those

453
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,260
about v6 so your sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> and marketing</font>

454
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:23,120
people ll be from your installations

455
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">your support in arc your entire</font>

456
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,479
engineering department and all the rest

457
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,070
maybe even management who knows that's

458
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,409
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time-consuming really</font>

459
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,610
expensive and sure you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as</font>

460
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:36,380
you train these people the risk is

461
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,990
they'll cover and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to train</font>

462
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,210
the next person so I think in a lot of

463
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,960
organizations the v6 support ends up

464
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:48,260
being a real specialist small team of

465
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,450
one you know Bob the ipv6 bloke who sits

466
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the corner who does this over lunch</font>

467
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,380
time sometimes and that's that's a risk

468
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,960
that you end up going going in that

469
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,429
direction so other political problems

470
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,830
what service level agreement do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

471
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,899
provide so a lot of the time it's not

472
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible to support saying service over</font>

473
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:05,590
the bring

474
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,010
a lot of service providers offer it on a

475
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,179
best-effort basis we do at the moment

476
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,879
how can you build this that's often a

477
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,380
problem so who's in store responsible

478
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,700
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the installs of sport again you end</font>

479
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,530
up everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that goes with v6</font>

480
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,010
and and they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob the ipv6</font>

481
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:23,649
bloke who now never takes a lunch break

482
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:26,980
and it does anyway and because some of

483
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:30,010
the people are so anti v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> fer may be</font>

484
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,870
right reasons you know whatever it ends

485
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,750
up being still a philosophical debate on

486
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,100
going so the systems which is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

487
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,350
biggest areas that people often forget

488
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,270
about when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this so how</font>

489
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,429
many systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end systems that are</font>

490
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,040
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your in your business and how</font>

491
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:48,910
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them do support v6 and would</font>

492
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,129
need to support v6 how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them are</font>

493
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,750
bespoke you know written in house<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

494
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:57,370
then if they are you know who wrote it

495
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,780
Steve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scripts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are hearing he left we</font>

496
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,729
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the source code anymore or</font>

497
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">deer so you know if you're going to</font>

498
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,400
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolling v6 functionality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into all</font>

499
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,050
your systems that's it that could be a

500
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,730
big big task and can cause you know it's

501
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,780
gonna be huge investment to do that it's

502
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,010
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot of time for your IT</font>

503
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,830
department who probably got better

504
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,970
things to be doing as they see it so

505
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,949
what sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems are talking about</font>

506
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:21,370
well everything here and everything else

507
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,630
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can think of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your dns IP</font>

508
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,270
allocations your network monitoring

509
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,640
that's a big one sales and billing or

510
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">just trouble tickets in it will convince</font>

511
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,180
early systems with databases that holder

512
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,830
the information how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those you've</font>

513
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,210
gone out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment if you've</font>

514
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,409
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> little thing with all the dots in</font>

515
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,180
your just go and fill out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP</font>

516
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,920
addresses that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font>

517
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure everyone's got those all</font>

518
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,470
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> other scripts kicking around and</font>

519
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,639
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other systems and service</font>

520
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,930
you know how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

521
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to support these six if you can</font>

522
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,040
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and the same level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as v4</font>

523
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,310
that's a question need to go and ask

524
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,230
yourself so a quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion you know</font>

525
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,389
moving to v6 for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

526
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">eaten if you're lucky if you haven't all</font>

527
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,300
that huge a network it's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

528
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,580
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got four or five devices you know</font>

529
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:04,200
shouldn't be too<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult the larger</font>

530
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,129
network you've got the harder it can be

531
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,380
especially if you've got a big variety

532
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,020
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> kim it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to justify all</font>

533
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,450
that so the finance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and</font>

534
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,710
humor is a human<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources required it's</font>

535
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,290
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn around people and say</font>

536
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,850
that you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font>

537
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,639
we've all got<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important things to</font>

538
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,600
be doing that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> owners money today</font>

539
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,070
the ongoing<font color="#CCCCCC"> support of it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

540
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,179
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky because again you've</font>

541
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,060
probably got a limited number of people

542
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,620
are supporting this and you know sure if

543
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,659
they go then you're left with this this

544
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,239
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> outcast network with whom to</font>

545
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,580
support it but the later you do it the

546
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,350
more different is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be so one of</font>

547
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,520
things about doing it like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

548
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:42,510
you build some knowledge within your

549
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,639
company about v6 so it gets you some way

550
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,500
of thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about v6 without having to</font>

551
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend a huge amount of money on it so</font>

552
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,540
perhaps you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start thinking about</font>

553
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,920
it now maybe so some takeaways here so I

554
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,000
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where do you really think</font>

555
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,070
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be going do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really</font>

556
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,480
think it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nowhere a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

557
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">people think it's never going to be an</font>

558
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,420
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> and maybe that's true I'm surely</font>

559
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,340
nobody can say for certain but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

560
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,960
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of political issues</font>

561
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,340
that might make this might well make

562
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,200
this something that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

563
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,399
doing at some point in the future so

564
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,650
your best<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start thinking about it now</font>

565
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,370
do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have to do this to do</font>

566
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,660
you think you'll actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

567
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,830
deliver it so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't they were</font>

568
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,560
doing do you think your customers will

569
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,840
actually come along and ask for this

570
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,950
yeah have a think about that so have a

571
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,230
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inventory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

572
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,880
look at your network out there now and

573
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,590
ask yourself you know do all these boxes

574
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">support these six you know if we had to</font>

575
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,610
turn on v6 tomorrow is it even that'll

576
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:40,890
work you know have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got kicked the</font>

577
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:42,810
Bible 58 whatever years ago yeah doesn't

578
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">even support v6 at all or supports it</font>

579
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:47,760
really badly and software or whatever so

580
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,110
who in your organization knows about v6

581
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,330
as well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean is there's probably some</font>

582
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,159
people who read up about this in their

583
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,889
own time who know you probably want to

584
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">be nudging and saying so you know you</font>

585
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,060
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start thinking about v6 properly</font>

586
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,710
maybe so have a little think about who

587
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,500
actually knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> about anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with</font>

588
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">this technology and have it have a think</font>

589
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,680
about what back office systems i said

590
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,810
just have a think about the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

591
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,850
everything that you need to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6</font>

592
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,710
in if you're going to be doing that that

593
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,668
you support v4 and now it's probably a

594
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:21,080
longer list than you think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

595
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:24,220
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it any questions well</font>

596
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,220
a few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could take a few</font>

597
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:34,710
Randy Bush I I Jane um the third

598
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,880
category of person they the one who

599
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,720
wondered if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make money</font>

600
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:46,740
you know if the v6 deployment is a loser

601
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:49,830
today in dual stack 6pe as a deployment

602
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:56,400
technology is if any closer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

603
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:58,230
x-axis and does it even cross it well

604
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,830
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of depends on your situation sure</font>

605
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:03,570
so if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer who says I</font>

606
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,699
want v6 and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

607
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,840
this much traffic then you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

608
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,030
look at how much it's going to cost you

609
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,320
to support to everyone and then how much

610
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,750
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support the cost you to</font>

611
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,230
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on specific boxes doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6pe</font>

612
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">and my point of view is that it probably</font>

613
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,190
is more likely to make you money quicker

614
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,320
doing it like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this because you haven't</font>

615
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,909
got quite so much expenditure capital

616
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,200
expenditure and operating expenditure to

617
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:30,240
actually get to the point where you're

618
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:32,720
carrying the traffic I Ted silly from

619
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,460
sprint same<font color="#E5E5E5"> question a lot different</font>

620
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,169
angle on it though but when of your

621
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,780
first slides talked about adoption and

622
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:43,950
you said he had EU North America<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

623
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:46,470
Asia pack up there I'm curious if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

624
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,780
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer this what percentage</font>

625
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:54,059
of customer is asking you for v6

626
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,350
capability pay for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> who sorry who</font>

627
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,210
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> are it and then pays for it</font>

628
00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,510
yeah what is the pain percentage of

629
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,440
people asking for research<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

630
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,400
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that are actually</font>

631
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:09,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking us generally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for v6 is a small</font>

632
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:14,159
percentage but it tends to be in the

633
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">higher-end category so a lot of large</font>

634
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,169
new projects actually turn around and

635
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:21,240
say you know we want a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4</font>

636
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:23,940
capacity and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason about v6 and we'll</font>

637
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,340
pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it pretty much everyone who gets</font>

638
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,650
the last v6 expects to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a</font>

639
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer point of Union interesting okay</font>

640
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:34,650
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> different here yeah I'm</font>

641
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:37,289
fine absolutely Peter<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean maker with</font>

642
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,970
very oh um I was wondering are your 6pe

643
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:42,600
boxes or those new boxes you're buying

644
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,010
or your recycling boxes some okay when I

645
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,320
look at what you've presented I see

646
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,539
actually a significant amount of cost

647
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,178
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> capital intensive because you have</font>

648
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,879
to buy new boxes also operationally

649
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,440
because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that your</font>

650
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,450
operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are familiar and it's</font>

651
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,399
a new technology basically overlaid on

652
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,860
top of a network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's already existing</font>

653
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:04,620
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also see a lot of</font>

654
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,860
provisioning time or availability for

655
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,379
customers who do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to purchase the</font>

656
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:14,129
ipv6 service so if somebody wants to buy

657
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:18,630
it in net and amsterdam you guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

658
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:20,250
go out install the<font color="#CCCCCC"> box turn it on so did</font>

659
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see a lot of cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

660
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,480
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your goals seems to</font>

661
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:26,460
be to reduce costs but show everything

662
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,440
you presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me appears to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an</font>

663
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,169
increase in cost yeah it depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font>

664
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,980
look at this sir first of all I am I to

665
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:36,570
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use a same edge technology</font>

666
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">for well use the same device that we use</font>

667
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,530
for standard v4 connectivity we use it

668
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,580
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad for these 6b devices which is a</font>

669
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:46,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">super</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sub 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> platform those devices are</font>

670
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,549
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard for us and we roll you</font>

671
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,539
know it's a fairly standard device for

672
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:52,830
older men all the time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

673
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:54,360
that because the number of customers

674
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,850
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a v6 at the moment are</font>

675
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,820
quite small but they tend to be fairly

676
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:02,490
high end we want to be able to offer

677
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">this v6 functionality so we don't</font>

678
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,909
actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy it in a great</font>

679
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:08,070
number of locations so the trade-off

680
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:10,830
here is if the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers is</font>

681
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,658
fairly small but significant you know

682
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,309
significant customers then you don't

683
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,950
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy in too many locations and</font>

684
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:19,860
that probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost you less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font>

685
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,080
center expenditure of moving your entire

686
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,990
existing networking to be six but it is

687
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,030
a traitor

688
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:30,020
what was your the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main box that was your</font>

689
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:34,370
limitation and doing ipv6 on your

690
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,690
network I'm sure we all can either that

691
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,250
there are a number of devices and I'm

692
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:42,140
sure where I've out there that don't

693
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:45,080
support b6 very well let's uh let's take

694
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,640
the folks who are over here and Steve

695
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,889
and then cut it off so we cannot keep

696
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,530
moving on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right my name is</font>

697
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,900
chris i work for mci orion editor supply

698
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,870
pen today so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a security question</font>

699
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:03,440
really about six PE and about providing

700
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:05,959
service for your customers 6pe and as

701
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,409
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as my understanding of us looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

702
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,730
it is your LSB actually terminates on

703
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:14,570
the edge device so if you get enough

704
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,370
traffic toward the edge customer you

705
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,230
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially lose your edge device</font>

706
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,969
and you have no way to filter it aside

707
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,620
from just removing the LSP from the

708
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,240
device is that correct in your case

709
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,850
sorry if you'd run upon me going to go

710
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:31,610
to necto<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so somebody spins up</font>

711
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,760
the largest let's say detox botnet and

712
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,168
v6 ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> right 1.5 million host and a</font>

713
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,929
minute one of your customers whose v6

714
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:40,700
connected over your 6pe network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

715
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:43,789
no way of filtering that traffic in your

716
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">core your edge device has to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

717
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:47,780
and if you get enough traffic to blow

718
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,370
out your edge devices uplinks you have

719
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:53,418
to remove six te service from that

720
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:55,520
device right<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes potentially potentially</font>

721
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,799
so that impacts all the six<font color="#CCCCCC"> BD customers</font>

722
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,559
there for one silly customer who upset

723
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,900
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you have you have you gum</font>

724
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,370
and I the follow-on really is is have

725
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,520
you gone back to the vendor and ask for

726
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,229
some ability to filter inside of LSPs

727
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,580
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in issue at the moment not been</font>

728
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,590
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them to do it or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not been</font>

729
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,780
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask them would still something</font>

730
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,590
with real time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say that again don't</font>

731
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,100
think that's something we've actually

732
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:20,840
had to consider in a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay just</font>

733
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,928
curious because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to ask vendors</font>

734
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,850
for that

735
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:30,520
thank you filtering at the edge for a

736
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,520
seat is possible it doesn't hardware so

737
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned that</font>

738
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,040
customers are willing to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for v6 are</font>

739
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,210
they willing to pay a premium for v6 or

740
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,399
do they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay the same rate per</font>

741
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:49,490
bidders for before I'd say same right

742
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:51,230
the way we actually implement the v6

743
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,290
connectivity to customers ends up being

744
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,340
the same rate for v4 and v6 though I do

745
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,840
actually see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people are</font>

746
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,370
actually willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay a premium for it</font>

747
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,230
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as at the moment it's difficult to</font>

748
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,489
offer entire company support it would be

749
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,810
difficult for us to justify charging

750
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,310
people even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money for something</font>

751
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:13,040
that's potentially got less people

752
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:16,700
supporting it Jason chill Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> chiller</font>

753
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:21,409
unit mci I have two questions the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

754
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,990
one is are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing labeled v6 bgp is a</font>

755
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,690
full mesh between all your 6pe devices

756
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:28,730
and if so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that this will</font>

757
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:35,480
hit scaling limitations driving you to

758
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:38,630
do v6 in the core yes and yes okay um go

759
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,890
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment it's as I've</font>

760
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's not a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

761
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,530
devices were running at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

762
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:47,840
yes it's a full mesh right now it won't

763
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,250
be for long so well you know we're

764
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,879
looking at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next way of scaling that</font>

765
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,260
back up and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I had was</font>

766
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,480
you did say that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eventually</font>

767
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,550
get to native v6 in the core do you

768
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,470
think that doing 6 p-8 as an

769
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,450
intermediary step makes that migration

770
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:06,560
more difficult or have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered</font>

771
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:08,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well all I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a v6</font>

772
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,179
native court I'm sure there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

773
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,590
people who probably wouldn't from my

774
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,240
point of view yes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does make it easier</font>

775
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,709
purely because if you've got some v6

776
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,970
functionality out there and people can

777
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,670
actually see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does earn you some</font>

778
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,810
money then they start to like it more at

779
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,100
the moment for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people it's</font>

780
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,780
something they've never actually

781
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,010
encountered in practical sense I've

782
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,500
never actually seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> earn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them any money</font>

783
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,000
so if you have any form of v6 out there

784
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,800
people start to actually learn about it

785
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then they start to accept it and</font>

786
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,060
then it's easier to justify doing in

787
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:38,570
other places I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my questions from a</font>

788
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:41,080
technology standpoint is it easier to go

789
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:44,178
from no v6 at all straight to native

790
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus to go from 6pe to native</font>

791
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:48,649
in terms of a migration I mean that

792
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,899
depends on your network from from my

793
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:52,998
point of view I'd say that 6pe probably

794
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:56,059
does make things easier because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

795
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:59,149
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some okay the sick speed of</font>

796
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:01,460
boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've got actually are just a</font>

797
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:03,350
superset of the v4 one so they take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

798
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,990
an exact we take an exact configure the

799
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,539
v4 standard edge device I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> plum v6 on</font>

800
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:11,210
the top so it does mean if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

801
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:12,980
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolling v6 on Tullio devices we</font>

802
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,499
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know various things don't</font>

803
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,730
break so yeah it kind of does make it

804
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:19,759
easier but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends on your own Emma</font>

805
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,080
your last one Peter shown maker ethereal

806
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,340
as just wondering if you tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us how</font>

807
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,230
you're handling your pairing in your

808
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:29,689
interconnects with other providers using

809
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:31,940
the 6p he boxes ooh parent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

810
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,669
we're doing trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do everything as</font>

811
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,309
much as we can native on these 6p

812
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:38,629
devices directly in some cases that's

813
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:42,529
not possible so we end up doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnels</font>

814
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:45,080
but ya you know is it mostly native now

815
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:46,460
are mostly tunnels actually that because

816
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,699
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we're try to push it is</font>

817
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,759
actually mostly native so to be honest

818
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,629
it's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier at the moment to use</font>

819
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,519
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to roll out a</font>

820
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:56,899
complete v6 native cool then you

821
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably under to have v6 on all the</font>

822
00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:00,559
devices you currently do private pairing

823
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arrangements on and that that's that's</font>

824
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,149
kind of an issue so you end up doing

825
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:07,459
this experiment places maybe the

826
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:10,100
exchange points but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a hopes that</font>

827
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,139
produce you there so do you see

828
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:16,129
providers adding private interconnects

829
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:17,719
for just v6 I'm sure at some point in

830
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:20,230
the future if the whole thing actually

831
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,710
starts making lots of money than yet

832
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,710
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> jill stack</font>

833
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,590
okay thank you
