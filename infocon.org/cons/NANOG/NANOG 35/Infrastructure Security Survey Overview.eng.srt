bit of qualitative information but it's

21
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,140
clear once you actually start to read

certainly a number of recent press

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> threat faced by zombies in you know</font>

is it I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting in the survey</font>

204
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,590
as well that folks talked about these

<font color="#E5E5E5">ten thousand a hundred thousand and we</font>

207
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,469
asked a couple of them how do they

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,700
measure this the answer we got back was

209
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,550
while they didn't it just seemed that

210
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">large so it is convention I think</font>

211
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,429
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussion with zombies</font>

212
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,290
but tends to be very difficult actually

213
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,300
to validate or to measure the size of

214
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,250
attacks in fact with everyone we checked

215

our online gambling especially

Offshore's technically legal in the US

293
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,529
so it's a little bit tricky to actually

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:50,279
call up law enforcement and ask for

296
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:56,040
quite quite frankly the tools involved

and the lack of forensics so finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

the biggest threat mitigation detection

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,429
major factor in how different providers

00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,490
think dan and I plan to try conducting

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,550
the survey again perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a slightly</font>

310
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">think in the future we've learned a</font>

lesson about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ambiguous multiple choice</font>

the since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got was very few folks</font>

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely the survey was really for the</font>

351
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,360
providers and it was really provider

352
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,280
reasons why they didn't pursue but

353
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,130
absolutely certainly there's incentive

for customers Nick famous<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turk Georgia</font>

Tech same question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> randy's but four</font>

356
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,050
hijacked prefixes you get a sense for

357
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,710
how much how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

from from

359
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,300
kind of space yeah um I think actually

360
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,339
there's another there's a talk at this

361
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nana I've got hijacked prefixes is that</font>

362
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,550
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> man just yeah you know I think it's a</font>

363
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,020
I don't have good numbers on I think

364
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's an interesting question it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

365
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,510
somewhat difficult to measure I think

366
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,939
there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of research</font>

367
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,370
efforts to correlate hijack prefixes

368
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,740
both with das logs as well as hijacked

369
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,680
prefixes with you know multi gigabyte

370
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,230
you know spam logs and i think that the

371
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,959
results have been mixed my sense of it

372
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,360
is that when i tried to do work in this

373
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,180
area is now two or three years ago that

374
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,440
despite you know the publicity got there

375
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,910
really wasn't much I could actually

376
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,150
correlate looking through gigs and gigs

377
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,980
and maybe there was one there's

378
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,959
certainly no validated reports now at

379
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,160
least near three or four cases where

380
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,800
there actually have been hijacked

381
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,689
prefixes but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short answer is</font>

382
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,579
might get my sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have good</font>

383
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,460
numbers is that it's mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

384
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:42,920
that's more effort it's just no need for

385
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:44,650
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks last question yep oh you're</font>

this is your mouth water because yeah

394
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,220
am very interested in the research that

395
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:11,630
you have done because i was for four

396
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:14,090
years running an IRC server together

397
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:17,030
with european Nuclear Research Center

398
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:20,630
where they were making big researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

399
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:24,230
by about denial of service attacks and I

400
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:27,170
have noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that during this time most</font>

401
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:30,080
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

402
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:33,079
situations with law enforcement it was

403
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,700
pretty hard however when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go to</font>

404
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:39,470
directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> to isps who we know the</font>

405
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,340
computers are hacked and computers or

406
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,950
hijack they it seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like better</font>

407
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,810
to get those old and most computers that

408
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,830
we noticed they were basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

409
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,020
users with

SL or cable internet access high-speed

411
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet access so do you think that</font>

412
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:01,420
against denial of service attacks ISPs

413
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:04,490
should take a responsibility of the

414
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,950
users that they are that they have in

415
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,339
their backbones and then keep the

416
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:12,470
security or should love enforcement go

417
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,139
to the user instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ESPYs so I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can answer that</font>

419
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,070
question fairly I tend to be a security

420
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:23,330
vendor so my responsibilities all

421
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:25,280
vendors should take response for example

422
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:27,980
let me give an example for you at the

423
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,710
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think American online not that</font>

424
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,350
i'm using so often but they have like a

425
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,240
fireball and a spam scanner for do you

426
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,480
think that all SPS should provide some

427
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:42,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of software for their clients so</font>

428
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,740
that they can secure their computers

429
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,560
sure sounds good to me so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think to</font>

430
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,390
will rather net for seizures response i

431
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,470
think to real responses one is you're

432
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,960
certainly seeing this within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye to</font>

433
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,430
community there's lot of now enforced

434
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,740
sort of before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually attach</font>

435
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,290
to most of the eye to institutions your

436
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,030
you do actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to validate you</font>

437
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you can have the VPN that</font>

438
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,530
you actually do the viral software

439
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,270
installed I think secondly what seems to

440
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,620
be happening in the marketplace is that

441
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,320
you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's really</font>

442
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the market incentive to you know for</font>

443
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,159
provider to force thousands of their

444
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,679
their end systems whether you be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

445
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,840
broadband or subscriber age I think you

446
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,270
do see the opposite commercial pressure

447
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,129
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two ones and tear tues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

448
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,280
essentially provide clean pipes the

449
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,750
large hosting customers so you know I

450
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,149
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I think it's following</font>

451
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,880
economics and I don't think their second

452
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:37,310
economics now for you know large cable

453
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,750
provider in the US to enforce this on

454
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,330
all of their users in fact I think

455
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,850
there's the opposite pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

456
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,280
okay and last<font color="#CCCCCC"> question very quickly and</font>

457
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,199
matt attack from yahoo<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

458
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,210
be a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a chicken</font>

459
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the egg phenomena happening for part</font>

460
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:56,170
of the survey in that you you know

461
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,450
ninety percent of the attacks are still

462
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:02,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP and UDP flood the brute force</font>

463
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,740
attacks this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is based on a survey</font>

464
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,350
than an actual empirical observation of

465
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,200
networks it may simply be that we're all

466
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,179
still too overworked and don't have

467
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,540
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good tools at our disposal to</font>

468
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:18,570
spot anything other than oh my god the

469
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,100
pipes are full so in asking a survey

470
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,610
like this you may actually be getting

471
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,530
just a biased response of what are the

472
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,080
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can spot not what kind</font>

473
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,360
of attacks are really happening yeah so

474
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,149
I think the short into that is i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

475
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think so actually you know no</font>

476
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,400
longer quite a research if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do from a</font>

477
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:41,189
commercial perspective of access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

478
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">know fairly significant set of you know</font>

479
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,580
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> related events in database and</font>

480
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,830
they can tell you from a commercial

481
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,919
perspective the survey does match what

482
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:53,010
we see commercially across both EMA<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">north america would you like to add in</font>

future one possibly correlate your

486
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,580
observational with the survey yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

thank you thanks Craig
