00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,240
good morning first off just wanted to

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,018
let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know my name is Jason Schiller</font>

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,639
from uunet<font color="#CCCCCC"> mci and I have a bunch of</font>

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,340
background slides and some slides

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,529
talking about how shim six works so if

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,960
you're familiar with this go ahead and

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,600
dive down into your email and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

work<font color="#CCCCCC"> done the other point I wanted to</font>

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,019
make out is before you phase out and say

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,349
oh we're not doing ipv6 this is academic

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,449
or esoteric I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out</font>

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 is important even if you're</font>

and the other interesting question is

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,050
when will v6 go<font color="#CCCCCC"> primetime</font>

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,769
and there's an ongoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate about what</font>

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:22,450
that date is somewhere between 2016 and

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:24,739
2009 is kind of where the endpoints are

53
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,230
we also need to consider this<font color="#CCCCCC"> beat of</font>

57
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,929
looking at how big<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v6 routing table</font>

58
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,780
is to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take a look at the v4</font>

59
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,290
routing table and try and figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

60
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,610
what types of routes we see in v4 we

61
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,250
basically see three types we see

62
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,380
aggregates and we see two types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

63
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,870
aggregates we see one type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

64
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,720
aggregate where a company got a small

65
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,579
allocation say as last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font>

few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years later they outgrew it they got</font>

67
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:04,370
a second / 24 but you are non contiguous

68
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,959
and they didn't return<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one the</font>

69
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,819
second kind of degradation we see is

70
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,849
where a large aggregate has been

71
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:13,099
assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> say like a / 20 and that's last</font>

72
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:15,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 has been divided up into discrete /</font>

73

for traffic engineering possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

76
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,010
they have multiple stub sites that are

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,120
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something smart if you</font>

80
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,900
report we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 160 k prefixes in</font>

81
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:38,470
the ipv4 Internet routing table and we

82
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,299
can easily aggregate those down to 112

83
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,299
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's about 55 k</font>

00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:45,709
intentional<font color="#E5E5E5"> d aggregates and again</font>

85
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:49,040
hopefully this is because people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

86
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:52,489
doing something smart so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,530
here is if we move to v6 tomorrow with

88
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,889
no growth and everyone does<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual stack</font>

how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these six routes will we see</font>

90
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:02,329
well we've got the current v4 routing

91

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,529
system will at least have one aggregate

97
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,750
so pick your number roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 k active</font>

98
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,659
day s is 30k assigned a s is somewhere

99
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,400
in there and then on top of that you've

100
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:27,500
got your intentional d aggregates

101

<font color="#E5E5E5">to solve the problem is to try and</font>

allow service providers to announce a

without putting d aggregates into the

is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information is lost when you</font>

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:06,139
have you end up with some optimality in

143
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,030
the routing system and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have</font>

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of forwarding plane mechanism</font>

145
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,599
to offload this functionality to so shim

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">6 was basically an attempt to solve the</font>

148
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:22,419
aggregation the idea here is you put

149
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,860
multiple IP addresses on each end node

150
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:26,960
these are called the locator IDs which

151
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,060
actually locate where the node is on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet apart from this they've</font>

153
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,560
separated from the locator idea this

154
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,510
concept of an upper layer ID which is

155
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the thing that your TCP or</font>

156
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:41,310
upper layer protocol terminates on

157
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,560
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is you can have a host</font>

158
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has multiple sources or</font>

161
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,030
the TCP session which is terminating on

162
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,320
the upper layer ID part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the problem</font>

with this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home</font>

discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what upper layer IDs</font>

to use but right now it seems the best

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,930
solution is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to simply map your IP source</font>

and IP destination into your upper layer

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,910
over all your sessions to use the layer

217
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,530
all you have to simply do is detect in

218
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,850
the forwarding plane either from one end

219
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,800
or the other that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been an outage</font>

220
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:19,320
and simply replace one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the addresses</font>

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:21,959
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP header so one of the things</font>

222
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,430
that's fairly interesting here is how

providing a solution well it was then

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,750
pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to me that RFC 3582 which</font>

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,100
requirements for v6 that the word

requirement doesn't actually show up in

245
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,220
the document and all uses of the word

246
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,500
requirement were downgraded to goals so

247
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,900
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this type of traffic</font>

248

250
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,940
and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of reasons the</font>

251
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,099
first reason is a lot of the network

252
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,860
operators that are involved today mostly

253
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,660
have consumer customers most of their

254
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,820
consumer customers are not multihomed

255
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,230
and they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that simple fail of</font>

256
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,470
resolve the problem for ninety percent

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet there's a strict focus</font>

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,790
right now on forwarding paths failure

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,300

260
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,339
a harder problem to solve and they're

261
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,349
really currently only just concerned

262
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,610
with designing the protocol and in the

no impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the protocol</font>

267
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,709
and I've talked to a few people after

268
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,200
the sessions and posted a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few things and</font>

you can add some sort of pipe length

their IP space so if you if a host

decides to use providers a address but

there ipv4 traffic engineering and bound

influence routing to determine what

traffic will load inbound links they can

use an<font color="#E5E5E5"> approximately shortest path which</font>

349
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,650

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,860
designate links<font color="#E5E5E5"> as primary secondary</font>

353
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,000
med they can attempt to share traffic

354
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,550
across multiple links by dividing up

355
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,410
their route advertisements they can

356
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,479
attempt to dial traffic around by

357
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,000
shuffling multiple smaller prefixes

358
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,620
across links and they can try to buy us

359
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,050
some traffic away from the best path

360
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:57,700
using a s prepending in v6 a multi

one particular address that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

instead of waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an outage you can</font>

371
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,540
immediately switch to use the upper

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,160
layer ID and you can use the cleans that

our locators are ordered in the right

order and start sending traffic down the

optimum path the problem is prior to the

shim all of your inbound traffic is

<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be based on your DNS choice so</font>

if you have a lot of sessions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

380
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,449
very short-lived the shim approach isn't

381
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,379
really going to help you much with

382
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:50,079
traffic engineering after the layer

383
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:52,870
three shim is inserted though you can

384
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,729
simply basically if you can get the

385
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:59,680
right clues to the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though he</font>

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:04,329
lacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP and igp information you can</font>

387
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,569
make the right decision so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea with</font>

388
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:10,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tlv is basically to send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> along</font>

389
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:11,560
additional information to the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

390
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,259
there's basically four different

391
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,540
approaches one approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to somehow</font>

392
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,790
get the destination to have the inbound

393
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,250
preferences and send those along to the

394
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,500
source the second approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to allow</font>

395
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,899
routers that are in line<font color="#CCCCCC"> to insert</font>

396
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,360
inbound preferences to the TL vs as the

397
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,250
shims are exchanged so in this case the

398
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">host might not know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> preferences but</font>

399
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,360
the routers the host is using would a

400
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,339
third approach is to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shim</font>

401
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,350
function to the routers itself and not

402
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:39,880
do shim on the hosts or to do shim on

403
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,430
the host and do an additional shim on

404
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,110
the routers and the fourth solution is

405
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,109
to have sort of an eight plus eight

406
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:51,750
solution where routers will rewrite the

407
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,750
source and or the destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address</font>

408
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:00,609
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting side effects</font>

409
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:03,790
you're going back to source<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing</font>

410
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,429
versus host<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing part of the</font>

411
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,379
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the management of a</font>

412
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,209
multi humming solution for shim six

413
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,919
right now would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the end host if</font>

414
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,809
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end host is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one supplying this</font>

415
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,459
information and this might be a

416
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,520
difficult place to manage it if it's a

417
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,559
large commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you've got</font>

418
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,418
40,000 n nodes with the users

419
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,059
configuring a various array of different

420
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:27,010

network wide traffic engineering

422
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:35,950
preferences so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ideas here is</font>

423
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,260
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this functionality</font>

424
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router so if you could just pick</font>

425
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,270
your four or five internet-facing

426
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:44,020
routers

427
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:46,389
configure outbound preferences there and

428
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,879
then basically let the host pick

429
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,950
whatever locators they want and the

430
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,260
router will insert the tlv information

431
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,120
here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you can configure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

432
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,930
wide preference is without having to go

433
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">and touch every end host another</font>

434
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:05,380
approach is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some sort of network</font>

435
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,030
layer server that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically push</font>

436
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,620
down the policy to all of your end house

437
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,600
that they would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate but</font>

438
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,620
this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> need some sort of protocol</font>

439
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,090
there's some security implications

440
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,649
there's a lot of concerns here if you

441
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,870
completely move the shim function to the

442
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,880
routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll work as well but now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

443
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,310
routers will have to shim every packet

444
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,990
that goes through them and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

445
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,530
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this at 600 million</font>

446
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,150
packets per second the other question is

447
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,440
also which routers do the shimming do

448
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,240
you do it on in Brest you do in an

449
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,040
egress somewhere in the middle do you

450
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,750
have an MPLS label stack that you need

451
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,360
to look behind there's there's a lot of

452
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,890
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that a plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 solution was</font>

statements where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find your DNS</font>

limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me let me go through all of</font>

506
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,668
them and then you can push may or may

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:07,789
not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer right finding the</font>

name server by address or by name might

509
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">you end up having to find it by address</font>

510
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,570
and those things get hard coded and that

511
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,729
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> raises the issue of</font>

512
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:19,220
applications which depend upon some sort

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,280
of bootstrap mechanism IE you have

514
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard-coded IP addresses there's a second</font>

515
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,860
one which has to do with accounting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

516
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,820
understand ISPs actually like making

517
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:35,719
money and so they tend to track things

518
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:38,539
based on generally IP address and if

519
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,669
thing if the end hosts keep flipping

520
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:41,750
around this might you know has anybody

521
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:44,870
thought about the accounting

522
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:49,340
implications of the shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six approach</font>

523
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:52,239
and then the third<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing was you talk</font>

524
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,309
about aggregation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> D aggregation and</font>

525
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,890
I would posit that your idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

526
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:59,629
aggregation is my idea of aggregation I

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a consistent</font>

528
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:05,870
understanding about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregation</font>

529
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,400
means to individual ISPs so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

530
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,820
the three kind of things that pop out

531
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,220
immediately okay I'm not sure I if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

532
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,590
could stay at the mic bill I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

533
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your comment about aggregation d</font>

534
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,840
aggregation and maybe we need to talk

535
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:22,340
offline but for the other two okay let

536
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,030
me let me do the first one because it's

537
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,918
real easy Peter<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lawford once upon a time</font>

538
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,809
when he worked for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly large is P</font>

539
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,510
which is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> around decided that he</font>

540
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:37,399
was going to aggregate 192 / 3 and

541
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,730
announced that to everybody else right

542
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,610
that was his idea of aggregation right

543
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:49,780
this would be bad

544
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:51,580
I mean if I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2001</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 1 / 6 right</font>

545
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,020
and i announced that would people be

546
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:57,699
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm certainly aggregating</font>

547
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,770
sufficiently but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think anybody</font>

548
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,350
else would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that so there's</font>

549
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:05,170
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that that's</font>

550
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,360
where thats its ok so to address the

551
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,090
aggregation the the whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

552
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,149
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and create an</font>

553
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,939
Internet where each network or each

554
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,799
autonomous system is only making one

555
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,750
contribution to the routing table no no

556
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,309
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at all I want to be able</font>

557
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,730
to reach the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to be able to</font>

558
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:26,530
reach that's what the internet is for

559
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,270
I'm not disagreeing with you I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

will work fine you'll pick the one

address you'll insert your shim and you

has failed and the other addresses have

571
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:56,590
not been hard code hard coded you'll

572
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,630
never reach it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yes that is</font>

573
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:01,389
indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem that does not exist in</font>

v4 multi humming with<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregation</font>

575
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:08,140
today your third question was about what

576
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,390
happens with a host swaps back and forth

577
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,270
and I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm really</font>

578
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:16,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned about cost in billing but I'm</font>

579
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:19,480
very concerned about the traffic it's

580
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,280
scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think that a host might start</font>

581
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,690
using one address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then switch to</font>

582
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,418
another address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on another</font>

583
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,760
provider and if he does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

584
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:30,250
destination it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> load inbound</font>

585
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,590
links to the destination from one

586
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,090
provider or another provider and that

587
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,709
could be a significant amount of traffic

588
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:41,250
and good easily blow out links and

589
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:41,250
that's very problematic

590
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,350
hi I dang gol di I think shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is a</font>

591
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:52,210
wonderful attempt to solve something

592
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,209
that no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> really needed to be solved</font>

593
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:57,190
which is host<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing I mean you</font>

594
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,630
know this isn't a big demand being

595
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,669
placed on a lot of service providers to

596
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,549
to make sure that like residential

597
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">broadband host can can multi home even</font>

598
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:08,200
though this is something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

599
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,010
the ITF folks you know will say that

600
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,929
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have in the future</font>

601
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,840
refrigerator<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to multi home or what</font>

602
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">not I mean the real requirement all</font>

603
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,260
aside from the ideas requirement

604
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,178
documents is<font color="#E5E5E5"> foresight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing</font>

605
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,150
that's a comment that the question is

606
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:24,429
have has there<font color="#CCCCCC"> been any consideration</font>

607
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,820
given to the level of complexity that

608
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:30,070
this introduces especially in terms of

609
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,539
the host operating system you know some

610
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,918
of our operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> system vendors are</font>

611
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:38,799
better than others and you know I'm

612
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,440
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about asking some</font>

613
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,289
operating system vendors to put in

614
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,990
sophisticated networking code that's

615
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,820
going to affect internet architecture

616
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:52,090
into their operating systems and I feel

617
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,939
a little queasy do there's also of

618
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,709
course the issue that do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you</font>

619
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,330
know five million hackers to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

620
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,260
you know maybe through a bot or

621
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,370
something or zombie to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

622
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,340
influence Internet routing and any

623
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,899
thoughts or comments yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

624
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,639
your point here is best summed up by

625
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,580
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the IETF mailing</font>

626
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,559
list which was basically well<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

627
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,210
service providers want to put the cogs

628
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,270
of their traffic engineering in the

629
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:20,559
hands of<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users and yes this is</font>

630
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,879
something you guys should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be concerned</font>

631
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is something you guys</font>

632
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,620
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be speaking up about let me let</font>

633
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,539
me have a point of order here um we're

634
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,189
kind of out of time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this session but</font>

635
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,559
obviously this is an issue that people

636
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,210
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in now we have a buff on</font>

637
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,620
this this afternoon so we can kind of

638
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,169
make the choice right here do we want to

639
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend more time and get in the path of</font>

640
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:44,350
lunch or do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to this</font>

641
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">afternoon my question is really short</font>

642
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">David</font>

643
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,789
yeah okay that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is there</font>

644
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:52,879
anybody here who has a conflict because

645
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:54,320
we're running two parallel sessions in

646
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the afternoon who would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

647
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,450
statement now we could or have a

648
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,450
question or something now

649
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:08,250
go ahead Robert um to follow on with

650
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:12,179
what Dan said I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice any URLs</font>

651
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:14,010
in your presentation ended in tar gz has

652
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,870
anybody actually done any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

653
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,870
implementation of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm equally</font>

654
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,689
concerned about getting good

655
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:24,500
interoperability with host operating

656
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:27,510
systems I remember the late 80s and

657
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,130
plain old tcp/ip having problems with

658
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,350
malformed packets and stuff like that

659
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,830
and i think this opens a really big can

660
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,629
of worms this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff Houston from a</font>

661
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,240
painting perhaps if I could jump in and

662
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,429
say yes there is one experimental

663
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,460
implementation being done by Francois

664
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:46,080
DuPont he's in Brittany based on an

665
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,750
early version of this particular

666
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,899
protocol however the protocol spec is

667
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,760
still not complete so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be amazed</font>

668
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,990
if anyone else has managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write code</font>

669
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,990
at this point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

670
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,390
I've been asked by the way to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

671
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,980
the people do identify themselves at the

672
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:11,310
microphone and this is again Jeff used

673
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:13,980
in a vape Enoch all right well please

674
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:17,929
come to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bath two o'clock Sierra room</font>

675
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:23,960
b c and d right here yeah that's her

676
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay all right thank you Stewart</font>
