00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,760
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd take a minute to just</font>

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,500
explain our sponsorship and maybe

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,930
encourage others to do the same this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

been an<font color="#E5E5E5"> incredible amount of fun you can</font>

all not at all normally a much higher

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:36,870
voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so first of all a correction</font>

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:39,450
you mentioned the resources Steve the

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,829

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,510
and you'll understand everything I

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,820
assure you just the red staplers are not

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,660
giveaways you cannot keep the red

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,660
staplers okay so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed you know and</font>

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,619
I heard this at the committee meeting a

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,450
lot of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

24
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,580
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interested in sponsoring an</font>

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">analog at some point and a lot of work</font>

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,830
goes into it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the very first</font>

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,009
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anyone has to deal with when</font>

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,048
sponsoring an event like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

29
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:21,540
justifying it to your boss or to your

30
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,360
company there's obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> an expense</font>

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,220
involved network engineering resources a

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,049
whole lot going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and you know we'll</font>

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,479
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the thank yous at the end of the</font>

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">program but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought I'd spend a minute</font>

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,729
explaining how you can go about

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,159
justifying<font color="#CCCCCC"> sponsoring an event like this</font>

37
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,710
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix is an exchange point we</font>

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,090
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a network of our own but we</font>

39
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,158
obviously interact with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of network</font>

40
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,799
operators and we get that feedback all

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,960
the time we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this sometime</font>

42
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,079
so first of all the key is converting it

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,789
to dollars and understanding exactly if

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,199
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create that financial model</font>

45
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,750
particularly one that goes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a graph</font>

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,990
real well something really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to</font>

47
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,990
read it could be used very well to

48
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,869
justify a sponsorship so which financial

49
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,669
model is appropriate to do that we

50
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,030
looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and then when</font>

51
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">we thought we had the the primary</font>

52
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,640
obvious model we

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,260
searched all over the internet we

54
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,079
searched all over the world for for a

55
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,209
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good example to use in and</font>

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,940
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really could could be</font>

57
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,520
easily graft and pinpointed we<font color="#E5E5E5"> chose a</font>

58
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,250
ripe we looked for other conferences we

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,080
looked at ripe ripe had a participant

60
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">teliasonera and we wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,170
their participation model and see if

62
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:41,110
that converted to dollars appropriately

63
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:43,540
so here's what we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so if</font>

64
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,780
you go to ebay you'll see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> peter</font>

65
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,480
Cohen thanks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve Wilcox by honesty</font>

66
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,530
if you're out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there somewhere has put up</font>

67
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:57,040
his lanyard and his badge up on ebay for

68
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,620
for auction and as you can see we're now

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,510
currently at 13 pounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty and I</font>

70
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,390
believe we have how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left we</font>

71
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,840
have seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and 20 minutes left so</font>

72
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,579
for those of you who are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

73
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,580
participating you could help<font color="#CCCCCC"> increase</font>

74
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,160
the justification of nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> sponsorship</font>

75
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,110
simply by going and bidding on this

76
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,510
badge here's a close-up version you'll

77
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice here it says all profit will go</font>

78
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:30,390
to the what is this friends of Peter

79
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:32,859
Cohen beer fund at nanog<font color="#CCCCCC"> LA I'm</font>

80
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately it says also only 79</font>

81
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:39,010
people have looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this page now come</font>

82
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">on guys this is valuable asset so if you</font>

83
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,640
could calculate the value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your name</font>

84
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,260
badge and that alone has value come on

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,089
that's a takeaway that's that's

86
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,290
something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use to model that's</font>

87
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,010
all I'm going to say about justifying

88
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,010
sponsorship

89
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">whoops that's my email okay you can see</font>

90
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm old school<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so obviously in</font>

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,330
order to make this work<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean equinix</font>

92
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,920
is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said an exchange point we have</font>

93
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,570
exchange points all over the world their

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,130
places were obviously all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you meet</font>

95
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,400
and connect two switches and fun stuff

96
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,650
like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we we had to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,329
LA area to find people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> our Los</font>

98
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,399
Angeles internet business exchange to

99
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,170
participate and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that since</font>

100
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,310
all of you probably the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font>

101
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,140
do when you open your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptops is</font>

102
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,880
analyzed the network we wanted to show

103
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,070
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit and connect to a lot of</font>

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,070
networks and so we went out we asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

105
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,290
volunteers and we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a few namely</font>

106
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,780
one I wanted to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out was Peter</font>

107

Cohen and this is a quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we</font>

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,820
provided this you owe<font color="#E5E5E5"> me some free stuff</font>

116
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,320
little bit about the logical<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

117
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,940
diagram here the important thing to

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,770
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this diagram is on the left</font>

119
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,300
side that's that's the rest of the world

120
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,530
on the right side that's us and I won't

121
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,479
spend a great deal of time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

122
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,429
towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top one things you'll notice</font>

123
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,200
is some incredible volunteers who

124
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,600
provided transit we're now getting full

granted you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know is</font>

130
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,750
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a law of diminishing returns but</font>

131
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,450
we put a router at the other end of this
