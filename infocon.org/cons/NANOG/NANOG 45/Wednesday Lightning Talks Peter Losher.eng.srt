00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:12,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hello my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter washer you</font>

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,619
may know me from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peering buff as</font>

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:20,039
appearing but my spare time I

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:24,600
handle a lot of the DNS operations over

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,880
at ISC this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those timely talks</font>

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,010
where we're going to talk about

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that was very current as of</font>

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:38,129
last week actually a little bit

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,079
background on<font color="#E5E5E5"> January the 18th is prime</font>

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,670
became the victim of a DNS spoofing

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,680
attack using spoof source addresses some

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,570
of you or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are calling it an</font>

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,489
amplification attack because the query

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:57,809
is dot and that dot NS record is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

15
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:01,828
small about 47 octet and while the up

16
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:05,069
upward referral response is a bit larger

17
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,320
which is up 256 octet about five<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

18
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,119
the size so basically you're asking this

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,250
little small query and they're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

20
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,210
slightly bigger response going back to

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,920
the spoof to dress now one<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,320
aspect of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack is that the</font>

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,630
queries are being sent to the

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,100
authoritative name servers only<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,199
you see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this being it</font>

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,399
being hit by open recursive servers now

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,369
is that you can easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the list of</font>

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,829
authoritative name servers you just look

30
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,799
up any number of doma a number of domain

31
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,079
names look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the NS records and there's</font>

32
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,329
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> target versus having to scan the</font>

33
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,570
whole net for open recursive name

34
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:53,780
servers so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it would look</font>

35
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you basically dig your favorite</font>

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,909
authoritative name server for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,770
servers for root and it happily gives

38
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:07,079
you the list of root servers so this

39
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,639
this brings back an old debate now what

40
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,459
our authoritative name search server

41
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,160
supposed to do for queries<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

42
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,650
possibly can't answer

43
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:21,680
because it can only answer for what it's

44
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:23,750
either a master for or a slave now these

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,510
upward referrals as we call them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

46
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,770
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're basically useless the</font>

47
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,280
resolver should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information</font>

48
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,350
already and and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> already knows where</font>

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start and where and where to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

50
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">information from and frankly a proper</font>

51
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,760
resolver should consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> it consider an</font>

52
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,640
answer like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this be out of scope to come</font>

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,810
back so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically gets the answer it</font>

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,649
doesn't know what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with it anyway</font>

55
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:54,890
it's a scope so and the authoritative

56
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:59,030
name server should have a root hints

57
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:01,369
file and that if you're asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for just</font>

58
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Joe random authoritative name server you</font>

59
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,090
don't know if the root hint or the hints

60
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,610
file but that that surfer has is even up

61
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:13,010
to date as we all know we keep our root

62
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:15,050
hints pile up to date now and then upper

63
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,730
referrals can lead to referral loops so

64
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,660
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking again and again and again</font>

65
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:25,370
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that results in basically</font>

66
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:28,310
useless queries now the first thing that

67
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,190
at least I saw on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS operations</font>

68
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,530
list and the Nano mailing list was

69
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um just filter them out that we</font>

70
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:40,250
won't give a response back and and all

71
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,989
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good well that kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

72
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,260
work because they can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> just change</font>

73
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:47,320
change the question so and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

74
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,630
want break and just filter out 453

75
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,000
because like in the case of is prime

76
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,170
there are an ISP they run actual

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,500
authority that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually run</font>

78
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,760
legitimate services on their dns servers

79
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,940
so what you need is absolutely something

80
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,250
that is actually within<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS scope or the</font>

81
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,989
dns server scope to actually stop

82
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,040
answering these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what we</font>

83
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:16,160
really want is to basically refuse these

84
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,159
refuse these queries and then because of

85
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,890
it because if it's refused then the

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,340
offending query or the offending machine

87
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">should actually just stop</font>

88
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:31,969
so possible solutions for this and bind

89
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,810
if basically what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

90
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:39,680
include additional from cash equals no

91
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,539
to your global options now if you you

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,909
can also do this by just doing it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:48,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">global options and then allowing access</font>

94
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:50,509
on a per zone basis now and note that

95
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't just remove the root hints</font>

96
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:57,500
file because in bind because we like to

97
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,900
be able to bootstrap it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

98
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,060
coded into name d so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

99
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,188
root hints file it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

100
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,569
code that what it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> coded in and</font>

101
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:10,189
just uses that instead so and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

102
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:14,000
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> note that if you're still running</font>

103
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:18,229
bind<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight please stop for the good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,259
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so this is what you should</font>

105
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,270
see so you dig the server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

106
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,949
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> were refused and it basically ends</font>

107
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,159
up being the same size as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original</font>

108
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:34,039
query so there's no amplification you

109
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:36,409
get one for one now for<font color="#CCCCCC"> other DNS</font>

110
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,259
providers for the sake of clarity or for

111
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:42,050
the sake of fairness I believe DJ v dns

112
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:45,319
actually does refuse out of scope

113
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,770
queries from the beginning so you don't

114
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,870
have to do anything for power denese you

115
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,490
can set this in your config bot and set

116
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,000

that's been going around and has a has a

we can take a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions Martin leave</font>

it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hurricane so being protocol</font>

134
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,300
correct is great and you know we're all

some situations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client will</font>

146
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,419
still ask it wants an answer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it</font>

147
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,789
gets no answer then you're still going

148
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:34,299
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the packets coming in but unless</font>

149
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:36,250
is being being magnified or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

150
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,979
being sent back to an incorrect sauce

151
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,470
yeah well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're saying is that</font>

152
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:43,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you use refuse that if it's actually</font>

153
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">legit or if it's doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right thing</font>

154
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,659
that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll just say oh</font>

155
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,669
I've got refused I'm not trying again

156
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's a wonderful protocol</font>

157
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:58,570
response so let's talk about email here

158
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,490
you know we live<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world where the</font>

159
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,580
percentage of email is coming in that is

160
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,650
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted is far far greater than the</font>

161
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,770
amount of email that is wanted if dns

162
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:12,030
goes the same way inevitably at some

163
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,889
point maybe your answer gets modified

164
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:19,030
again it's the protocol stack versus the

165
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:22,169
real world true and if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

166
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,169
propose it then we're happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen</font>

167
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

168
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,250
if you're more time for one more time

169
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,900
Tom from dynamic when by this is a

170
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,679
buying specific question when you

171
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">configure bind for recurse know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

172
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,359
remove the root hints file if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

173
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,589
to remove the hints file and your

174
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,960
recursion knowing you're running

175
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:52,390
authoritative only why do you need to

176
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">fall back to hard-coded values in the</font>

177
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,560
source to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prime root hints you don't</font>

178
00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:00,900
need root hints anymore in the first

179
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:07,989
place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it a design question</font>

180
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:09,579
that's currently what yes that's

181
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's asking being discussed</font>

182
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sandy do you have a</font>

183
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,610
