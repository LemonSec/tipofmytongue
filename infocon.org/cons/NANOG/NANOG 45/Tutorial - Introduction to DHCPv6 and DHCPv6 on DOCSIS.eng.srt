1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:11,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk to you guys</font>

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,809
about these pv6 and what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do</font>

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,370
is I'll go through some basics I'm gonna

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,540
try draw draw some analogies I mean

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,550
there's enough there's a just<font color="#E5E5E5"> few enough</font>

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,520
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room anybody here</font>

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,180
familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> user active user of HP v6</font>

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,730
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good so what I'd like to do</font>

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,349
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you guys give you guys some</font>

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:34,260
background on the you know on the

11
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,260
protocol I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analogies</font>

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,820
where v4 and v6 are you know they've

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,079
similar to one another but also point

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,370
out some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the some of the some of the</font>

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,360
substantial differences between the two

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:49,199
protocols okay I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you story real</font>

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,129
quick we we did a panel at<font color="#CCCCCC"> cablelabs</font>

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,719
which is where we do a lot of our

19
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,210
standards work in the cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry and</font>

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,760
guy walks up to the safe if you know

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,949
walks up to me after the panel and says

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,510
you know wow I didn't know dc-6 wasn't

23
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,358
just you know an upgrade to be four

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,860
right so I mean so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that was</font>

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">like really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far left example you know</font>

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,539
but my point to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove is you know</font>

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,680
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still some at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the two years ago</font>

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,010
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were still some misconceptions</font>

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,920
about you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> v66 and you know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

30
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,970
relates to DC before right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make no</font>

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,400
assumptions up now I'm going to go and

32
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,729
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're and we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,240
have that problem here but give you an

34
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,170
example of some of the some of the some

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,979
of the comments we've gotten over the

36
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,680
years about these bb6 so this is kind of

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I chart version of the various</font>

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,299
topics that I like to kind of get into

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,939
in our tutorial here and since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

40
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,649
small group the one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

41
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,148
is gonna be best for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us is if you guys</font>

42
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,710
have questions along the way you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

43
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of get into something let's do it</font>

44
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's just you know let's make this as</font>

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,460
useful spot possible for everybody right

46
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,280
let's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a 90</font>

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,689
minute nap so so one of the things I

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,030
assume here is that you know that that

49
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,439
we have a common understanding of at

50
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,690
least basic understanding of how the ESP

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,820
before works

52
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:15,560
discover off a request<font color="#CCCCCC"> stack you know</font>

53
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:21,500

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,910
servers relays you know the basics going

55
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,870
to give you guys some pointers here some

56
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:29,680
some interesting RFC's that are often

57
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">referred to throughout my daily life</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have the ability to to do a bit</font>

89
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,989
with kind of the v4 equivalent we can

configuration information or canister

94
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,620
all the above right so there's a bit

95
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">more flexibility here but there's often</font>

96
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,410
opportunity for confusion and that you

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,780
know people people try to tie all these

98
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:27,110
all these concepts

99
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:30,198
and it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit getting used to at</font>

100
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,750
least from what I've observed the

101
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,919
stateful mode for DSP v6 is really

102
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,830
analogous to what we know and love today

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,930
in v4 world right where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically do</font>

from some other mechanism whether it's

statically assigned or configured and

110
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,900
we're only using DSP p6 to acquire the

kind of a quick comparison for those who

today simply

about some things that have have

generally speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know when we</font>

said this is hotly debated thus far my

199
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,970
will actually follow this behavior as

200
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:30,450
long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a client so like son</font>

a current version of these to be client

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,560
right so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a mixed bag right</font>

208
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,060
and some of them still require that you

214
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,160
you know it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting how this</font>

215
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,650
unfolds because in the later versions of

the art the v6 RFC's<font color="#CCCCCC"> will talk about you</font>

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:11,069
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end is still kind of there but</font>

218
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,589
the behavior is loosely or almost

219
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,640
completely on special<font color="#CCCCCC"> spot right so</font>

220
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,900
we're kind of hang we're kind of hanging

changes dramatically right it's no

longer a 48-bit mac mac address and say

chatter or client ID field in DC six

244
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,260
it's actually a depend on which one so

245
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:20,440
there's three formats a DUI d it could

246
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,680
be a fixed length it could be variable

247
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,410
length you know and it there are

248
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,650
guidelines in the RFC where one might

249
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,569
use one one type of duygu of another the

250
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:35,260
the key important point for everybody

251
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,690
note there is is you know if you if you

252

it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor-specific at this point</font>

264
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,649
there is a there's a vendor code which

<font color="#E5E5E5">also which you'll see in some of the</font>

267

285
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically I'm a client I asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for an</font>

286
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,470
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i advertised the ability to</font>

287
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,880
implement and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will mainly be offered</font>

288
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,480
an address right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will not go through</font>

289
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,830
the second step to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of validate</font>

290
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,810
the availability of the address right

291
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,160
there are some challenges to using this

292
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,310
but there also some upsides right you

293
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,920
know it's it's up to les messages right

294
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,510
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster but you know in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

network for example using rapid

296
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,510
committee would actually have some

297
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,089
challenges because we would have

298
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,800
potentially multiple servers believing

299
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:37,029
that their authoritative for the same

300
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,310

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,770
circumstances where they may or not be

307
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,160

308
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:57,270
lot of the clients almost always start

309
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,270
off so<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting up commit first</font>

310
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:06,069
and another another<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting point is</font>

311
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,320
when we when we configure d speed

servers today in before land I and I'm

313
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,800
guilty all the time of doing this I I'll

314
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,200
configure like a whole truckload of

315
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,670
options and have them you know sent back

316

319
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:31,450
great much more strict adherence to what

I send back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a client compared to what</font>

325

everything why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for it not</font>

326
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:51,120
that we're seeing that model change<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

327
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:54,150
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as implementers are concerned so</font>

328
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,610
kind of a nice pretty diagram of what a

329
00:14:54,150 --> 00:15:03,040
non relayed stateful DC v6 message

330
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:06,340
exchange looks like and we have text

331
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,400
version of a Wireshark trees so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

332
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,750
point out a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things here</font>

333
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,780
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first place</font>

334
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,030
where we're going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

335
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:19,449
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've talked about in the</font>

336
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides here right so you have our client</font>

337
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,890
identifier here and you'll see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

338
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:27,660
client particular and just a shout out

339
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:31,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is see this is all their software</font>

340
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,040
Suzanne it was something i was very

341
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,779
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with self</font>

342
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,269
setelah so we have nuclear plus time

343
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:43,370
right so time is used to add some

344
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,050
variability to the use of it but you

345
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,970
also notice that this one the link layer

346
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,758
it actually leverages you know

347
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,310
essentially the mac address we have an

348
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,420
option request option which is LR 0 so

349
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,569
this is what I was telling you about if

350
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,339
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go where if it's not in here</font>

351
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:02,479
generally speaking d server tackle send

352
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:04,459
it back right and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

353
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,709
elapsed time how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this sense of</font>

354
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">this transactions been kind of live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

355
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,819
the network here iina which is

356
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,529
essentially where we get information

357
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:15,639
about our addresses or the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

358
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:18,050
we're being assigned safely we have

359
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">NIAID and i'll get some of these things</font>

360
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,680
here but I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hesitate to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

361
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,630
get too deep in these things so cuz I

362
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't wanna put you asleep with some of</font>

363
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,430
the particulars here but you'll see that

364
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:30,109
we have our timers t 1 to 2 and of

365
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,930
course information about our IP address

366
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:36,560
and constructs that related topics tends

367
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:40,160
to prefer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have lifetimes okay so so</font>

368
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,160
in a v4 world you'll generally see only

369
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,189
these timers and they indicate renewal

370
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,380
and rebind or expiration right now you

371
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:52,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this notion of</font>

372
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:54,680
expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> edition of lifetime or timers</font>

373
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,860
where you talk about in actual life time

374
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,209
for the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself so what you'll</font>

375
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,790
notice here is valid is generally the

376
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:06,530
greatest value it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the absolute</font>

377
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,780
maximum length of time that this mode

378
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,180
should use this ipv6 address has nothing

379
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,930
to do with the ipv6 if in you know that

380
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,690
would be this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for lifetime so once</font>

381
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:20,089
this just know it reaches a point where

382
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:21,920
I've gotten to prefer a lifetime I need

383
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:26,569
to basically as a node start to think

384
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,860
about you know if I'm not instructed

385
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,720
that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue use address I need</font>

386
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,459
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start thinking about stop stopping</font>

387
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,140
use of this address<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so it's kind</font>

388
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,270
of bad grammar but I think you follow me

389
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,600
and these are what we call you know we

390
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,730
their time with TCP I'll renew this at

391
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,000
this number of seconds and I will

392
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,280
essentially expire it if it doesn't

393
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,350
happen at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time I'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a get</font>

394
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,000
into it some in-depth information about

395
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,800
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would see this in cable</font>

396
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,430
deployment and how we adjust these

397
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:59,030
values relative<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a dc-6 redundancy</font>

398
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:01,400
model which today is protocol free right

399
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:04,370
not on purpose is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not there yet</font>

400
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,890
right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a failover Purdy's</font>

401
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">pv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet so we had to do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font>

402
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,890
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that we could deploy dhcpv6</font>

403
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:15,750
to support our ipv6 deployment and

404
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:18,340
essentially had made adjustments to

405
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:22,390
you know the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> model that we use for</font>

406
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:24,610
deployment so that we've reduced the

407
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:29,910
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for undesirable and that's</font>

408
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:35,139
on the network what else we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

409
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:37,420
alright so the next three slides are

410
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,100
essentially the remaining three

411
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,840
exchanges pricing you'll notice that

412
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,110
this one's the advertised<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will not go</font>

413
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,730
through all these actually I should go

414
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:50,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">back for one second in the solicit which</font>

415
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,820
is basically the equivalent of a

416
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,129
discover what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of tomorrow</font>

417
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,990
equivalent discover you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

418
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,650
this there's an address in here right so

419
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:03,430
he had one and as a hint he sent it back

420
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,840
as a hint to the server say by the way

421
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,820
if you can give me this address back I'd

422
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,040
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this one please right so</font>

423
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,520
you know in some cases you'll see cohen

424
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,500
cohen there you know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all depends</font>

425
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">on what the prior state of the other</font>

426
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:21,520
client was so the advertised a lot of

427
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,830
the same fields here transaction ID IA

to that on the solicit request the

guys don't mind it may be shown hands

442
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:09,720
for objection I won't bore you by going

443
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:12,029
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> every one VCR slides I added</font>

444
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,340
them largely because field download them

445
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:15,779
and one for reference afterwards they'll

446
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,070
be in there right but I really didn't

447
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:19,049
have any intention of going through I

448
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,418
mean let's cut you guys want me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

449
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:28,679
through like 60 slides worth where we're

450
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:30,600
looking at like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASCII text so yeah so</font>

451
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,120
rapid commit we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought the ref commit</font>

452
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,590
to message exchange talk a little bit

453
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,209
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the shortcomings but also</font>

454
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,510
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the positive aspects rapper</font>

455
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:43,289
commit just something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about you</font>

456
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:46,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I won't belabor it but like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

457
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:49,129
we i would have some problems leveraging

458
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:52,080
rapper commit my network because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

459
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,279
because of the quantity of servers that

460
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,230
were using the network right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i burn</font>

461
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">min when we have two days be servers for</font>

462
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,370
redundancy and in our deployment we

463
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:01,200
would basically have both those servers

464
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,539
believing that they are authoritative

465
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,070
for that address so to kind of put a

466
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:08,129
little bit of additional context on it

467
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,840
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have if you have OSS systems or</font>

468
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,460
other internal systems that basically

469
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked to DCP servers to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

470
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:17,730
about who's been allocated what this

471
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,060
could actually create some<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems as</font>

472
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,590
far as keeping data straight

473
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,240
you know if you want if you leverage

474
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,040
lease query rightly square<font color="#E5E5E5"> you something</font>

475
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,450
we'll talk about here shortly and you

476
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,950
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the dhcp server say give</font>

477
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,560
me information about this binding that

478
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this DCP server has allocated and he</font>

479
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,659
gets conflicting information back you

480
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:45,770
might be hosed right so something think

481
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:49,100
about you turn it off they so so so what

482
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:52,010
I found you know the past five years at

483
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,800
least most implementers will first

484
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,660
implement Reb commit but then they'll go

485
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,690
and do the full state whole exchange

486
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,420
right I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of one that only</font>

487
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,470
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> rapid commit I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop my head</font>

488
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,010
right like and we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

489
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling you know again icsi see all the</font>

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:13,490
slide all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the examples Ric based but dip</font>

491
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,110
ler is another one yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could tell you</font>

492
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,360
that cable modems these decline kid

493
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,949
bottoms in beginning they supported or

494
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,679
ever commit because you know people you

495
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,820
know it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process right people</font>

496
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,320
are kind of getting their feet wet the

497
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">roller sleeves up learning how to had a</font>

498
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,100
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate code for these bb6 they</font>

499
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,650
want to kind of find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that they</font>

500
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,510
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit first to get their brain around</font>

501
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,370
what's going on here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they go</font>

502
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,010
from there right there's there's been a

503
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,820
lot of that it past<font color="#E5E5E5"> few years just you</font>

504
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">know just way we develop software</font>

505
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,409
products all right new protocols

506
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,409
or

507
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:09,849
very special service tax free

508
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,330
well so assuming you're talking about

509
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,280
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I've configured a 24 my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP</font>

510
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,689
server minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for the router and the</font>

511
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,160
Winans bumper to broadcast and I just

512
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,620
kind of have a client<font color="#CCCCCC"> I blessed and I</font>

513
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,660
suck up all the 203 addresses that thing

514
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,149
well i mean first and foremost right i

515
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:36,020
mean if I just put kind of the most

516
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,790
obvious and simple example I put a 64 on

517
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HP server right which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know</font>

518
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:43,129
common I'm gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awhile trying</font>

519
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,080
to get tossed back i right I mean I mean

520
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm let you know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not all seriousness</font>

521
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,540
I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna take is gonna take a</font>

522
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,190
while now now there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some other</font>

523
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,440
implications right that we should

524
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,970
discuss about that right so now even if

525
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,890
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never exhaust all the addresses</font>

526
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,140
they're still going to be an impact

527
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,660
right if I caused this tcp server to now

528
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,000
suddenly allocate a billion stateful

529
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,160
bindings you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

530
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,510
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that I mean it may</font>

531
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">never exhaust but the super mate they</font>

532
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">may crash because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know it</font>

533
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,970
choose that you know used up all the

534
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,440
member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box right or what-have-you</font>

535
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,530
right so there are the challenges

536
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,550
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think full</font>

537
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:23,240
exhaustion probably not one right right

538
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:25,550
right now something something else

539
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,470
before noting so i hope the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LP you guys</font>

540
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,050
don't mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of take a little hang a</font>

541
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:33,440
left turn here right but something to

542
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:35,540
consider right so your DSP server you

543
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to run it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same box and the</font>

544
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:41,180
same process right so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is not not</font>

545
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,300
like that right but there are others

546
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use third-party software where</font>

547
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,770
the same binary process supports ipv4

548
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,080
and ipv6 now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could separate them run</font>

549
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,850
to potentially suit separates process on

550
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same box or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i could split them apart</font>

551
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,030
right the reason I bring this up is

552
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,560
because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deployment because</font>

553
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,170
it's a separate protocol net right so

554
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,980
now now you could you could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

555
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:07,370
really could go and put like like we use

556
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,550
a cisco CNR for in our in our network so

557
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,350
that process<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one binary sports are</font>

558
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,409
three four of these before knees PP six

559
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,629
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can put all in one box all in one</font>

560
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,360
process right but you got on you have to

561
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to appreciate the the</font>

562
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">deployment challenge associate with that</font>

563
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,070
right if something goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong on the in</font>

564
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,690
the basic process it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect</font>

565
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,189
your before processing as well right

566
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,159
right so I've

567
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,049
the server up in vb6 land right before

568
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,730
could have problem too right now if you

569
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,519
have a separate process it might be more

570
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,200
difficult to manage but I'm a little bit

571
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,610
more insulated right so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not telling</font>

it's by all means give him calm I mean

578
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:56,689
that I think that's what this is for

a whole lot more to say about rap commit

584
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,019
um so

no I mean I actually would think so

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like network access</font>

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,320
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data thing right so yeah I mean</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I can absolutely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> P service that you can you can</font>

you know offer a different aspect of

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,158
redundancy with dstv six right a couple

622
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,320
because honestly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking for</font>

623
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,700
speed for address allocation you might

624
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,649
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could all to configure the addresses</font>

625
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,250
you can just tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a dual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

626
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:16,510

627
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,279
configuration information like the

628
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,470
stateless transactions certainly an

629
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,200
option

630
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:27,110
yep so the only thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll point out</font>

631
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,110
here you know tha's<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,090
wrap it up

634
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,500
tells the DS be server you know so so

635
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,830
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something interesting to note</font>

636
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:48,630
here client says I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could hear ab commit</font>

637
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:50,639
if DC server sends back a reply I went I

commit even though you said you can so

649
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,430
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go off you stay with</font>

650
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,429
these

651
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:21,789
reply kind of skip through that so real

652
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:25,120
a DSP packets of messages kind of

653
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:28,779
similar again looks looks as well as not

654
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,580
like DSP before right except for the

655
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:32,230
actual packet races which you'll

656
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,629
actually obviously note that there is

657
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is a difference we have really</font>

658
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward really applied messages right so</font>

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:08,889
messages and we have these<font color="#CCCCCC"> be exchanged</font>

669
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:11,590
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I apologize if this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font>

672
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,450
at least we can we can we can extract

673
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,129
the value from the text here so we have

674
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,810
a real a forward message you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

675
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,480
down here we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relay message and</font>

676
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,620
the encapsulated these PP<font color="#CCCCCC"> six message if</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this were to pass through multiple</font>

678
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:34,699
relays we would see this packet

679
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:37,010
encapsulated in a nested fashion for

680
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,600
every relay pastor right so we have

681
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">information about every relay it's gone</font>

687
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:02,650
stateless dhcpv6 again we assume we

688
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,090
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have enquired to address</font>

689
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:07,120
through some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other technique whether it</font>

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> statically figuration or whatever</font>

691
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,899
we're using DCP just to get

695
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,549
interesting point about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'll</font>

696
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,470
make relative to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is right now as</font>

702
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:47,260
IP addresses right so you know we have a

703
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,090
dual spec network here and then of human

704
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,940
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> music's enabled all my dns queries</font>

705
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,740
are go two varieties for unless i<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

file your network control panel whatever

709
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:04,150
right so that's an important point to

710
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,980
note now as an aside we have you know

711
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,419
various activities within the ITF where

712
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,000
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> putting more</font>

00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:13,720
information in our ages late dns server

714
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,940
information now it's relatively new

715
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,350
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first time it came</font>

716
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,540
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a year and a half or so</font>

717
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:22,600
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you have to appreciate that</font>

718
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,010
there'll be some patching of clients out

719
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,290
there in the networks that would

720
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:28,540
potentially make the ability to use that

721
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:31,800
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the near term in a uniform fashion</font>

722
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:35,250
somewhat complicated

723
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,430
so stateless<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttp information requests</font>

724
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:42,330
reply from the server and you'll notice

725
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:45,750
again a very abbreviated exchange I

726
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:47,399
basically said Here I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of these</font>

727
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:51,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">client and I want to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it raised</font>

728
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:58,130
information these<font color="#E5E5E5"> P service says here</font>

729
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:58,130
you go have a nice day we said

730
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:08,510
ok so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far any questions comments</font>

731
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:11,030
anything you guys want to kind of get

732
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,570
into other than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rex</font>

733
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,570
we've taken so far

734
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:24,030
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> none nope interesting</font>

735
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,039
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in we can talk about</font>

736
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:28,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second it is another highly</font>

737
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,000
debated topic because generally speaking

738
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,740
people you know that's what router

739
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,590
advertisements are for right in a router

740
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,740
advertisement you know sniff on<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone</font>

741
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes here your router advertising</font>

742
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,210
itself contained what will basically

743
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:44,460
tell a note here's your default route we

744
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,980
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into these kind of debates</font>

745
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,880
about whether or not we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a default</font>

746
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:54,000
gateway address for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 I can tell</font>

747
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you as of now there there is none right</font>

748
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,520
and we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen we kind of</font>

749
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,830
occasionally get that topic comes up at

750
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,950
ITF in the working group talk about the

751
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:07,470
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it but at this point there's no</font>

752
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:10,429
I'm not aware of any active draft that

753
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,429
specifies the default gateway

754
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:34,230
so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about that either on</font>

755
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:36,719
or off session here like in my world

756
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,130
like if you're running belated into

757
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,609
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you scenarios right</font>

758
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:43,080
whether you're on in datacenter VLAN

759
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:45,120
that's why data center right and they're

760
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,500
my rattles and I'm my servers but now

761
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,000
that I'm sitting you know the regular

762
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,460
are raised at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nodes are saying</font>

763
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,429
they're all girls st. they're all for me

764
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,650
right even in my email the cable network

765
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright seem TS ascending or outer our</font>

766
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,450

768
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:06,270
it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have a scenario in my</font>

769
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,819

770
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,860
from different people different

771
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,240
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and organizations that are</font>

772
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,820
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of present conflicting</font>

773
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,819
information to that note I've always

774
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,820
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little bit a little bit up I</font>

775
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,820
guess

776
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:25,490
easily confused by that scenario right I

777
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,930
mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to kind of ask you to</font>

778
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,759
talk it openly about something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

779
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,290
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about offline but I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

780
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">more about that but it's a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

781
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:36,980
point right that would be that would be

782
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:38,240
a problem right so you know I guess you

783
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,650
know purely<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a technical point of</font>

784
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,180
view that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be a challenge I mean</font>

785
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,500
you'd have to coordinate closely with

786
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,710
whoever you're sharing that VLAN with

787
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,710
right

788
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,859
the

789
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

790
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,960
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> common network isn't so</font>

791
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,329
like it sounds like a hosting model

792
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,440
right right so from some of the

793
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:10,670
conversations I've had with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

794
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,060
were those kind of networks it seems to

795
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:16,609
me that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the common network the</font>

796
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,200
network is not associated one of the two

797
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:19,848
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people who are</font>

798
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,529
hosting things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Network it's it's</font>

799
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:23,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy or the company who is providing</font>

800
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure and then I have</font>

801
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,290
clients but if the day is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done you know</font>

802
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,900
they still have to share the common

803
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network right it seemed to me I mean the</font>

804
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,940
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're describing is is</font>

805
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,230
it's it's your network that you hadn't

806
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,640
be sharing with another guy and you're

807
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,069
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to differentiate from an economic</font>

808
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:44,118
on the layer to a point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> view the</font>

809
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:49,520
traffic right so I guess I<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys a little</font>

810
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:52,069
help there right so so I like to catch

811
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,660
up with an answer or so prefix

812
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:55,880
delegation so we're gonna get to live

813
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,890
into this so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically where you</font>

814
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,720
know the best example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can offer you</font>

815
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,759
four previous delegation is you know

816
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,279
your you know your source prior says

817
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,030
well we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start off with you I</font>

818
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,819
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nativity you have a gateway as</font>

819
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,770
yusei's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable it's a router I want to</font>

820
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:15,440
delegate you a prefix of some length<font color="#CCCCCC"> N</font>

821
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:16,460
and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

822
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,839
cable network they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do with your</font>

823
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:23,480
DCP right and these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the options that</font>

824
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,420
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate that</font>

825
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,040
prefix down to that previous delegation

826
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,609
client which is at this point now the

827
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,609
home gateway

828
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:36,700
similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mass exchange solicit</font>

829
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise request reply the main</font>

830
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,350
difference now is I have I<font color="#CCCCCC"> upd options</font>

831
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:44,230
in the packet right<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus IA na the non</font>

832
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,480
temporary addresses I now have I APD

833
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,369
right and or not they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not they're not</font>

834
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,070
tightly couple another they're kind of

835
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:57,940
orthogonal i can send both or one or

836
00:37:51,070 --> 00:38:06,030
none right so let's see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my</font>

837
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:06,030
solicit not so interesting except for my

838
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:12,640
is my guess is that so in string will

839
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:17,770
show you the advertiser where we start

840
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:20,710
advertising the prefix down we have the

841
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:24,580
I APD option here again so this is this

842
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,840
is the new part this these messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

843
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,700
again we have a lot of similar

844
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:34,619
attributes timers lifetimes blank and

845
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,618
prefix and the length<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

846
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:43,679
and kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sidebar for conversational</font>

847
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:46,319
stake here this is where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

848
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,689
start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about redundancy okay when</font>

849
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:52,679
I'm allocating unicast addresses I've

850
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:53,699
got so many of them that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

851
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:55,409
technique<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will show we'll talk</font>

852
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:59,129
about later if it's really easy to

853
00:38:55,409 --> 00:39:02,279
provide well it's more straightforward

854
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:04,288
to provide redundancy for the individual

855
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:06,569
address assignment redundancy where you

856
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:08,339
come in to where you come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prefix</font>

857
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:11,849
delegation you start your start hanging

858
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:13,949
out for dtp fairly sizable chunks of

859
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,059
your address space right and in a lot of

860
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:17,639
the grand scheme of things but kind of

861
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:19,709
relatively speaking you now have a

862
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:22,859
greater need to maintain state between

863
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:24,839
two days<font color="#CCCCCC"> view</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers right so I believe</font>

864
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be it'll be things like prefix</font>

865
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:30,538
delegation that that's going to

866
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:34,079
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in the IETF</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for for ample</font>

867
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:36,449
matters to make available redundant with

868
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,979
a protocol point view taste ep 6<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

869
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:40,349
right because right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there is none</font>

870
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:41,549
there's no inner server protocol no

871
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:43,409
protocol for<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner server communication</font>

872
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:47,059
to facilitate the exchange of state

873
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:50,219
right unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> the failover dress for v4</font>

874
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:53,759
so same same idea just different options

875
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:57,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">here I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

876
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:59,849
about I a one other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I a option that we</font>

877
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:03,359
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten into I ETA right so I na</font>

878
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:05,459
is kind of like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> options for non</font>

879
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,769
temporary addresses so addresses that

880
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:11,098
would be expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a bit more</font>

881
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:12,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">persistent ipds for the prefixes I ETA</font>

882
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:15,589
are these edge to temporary address is

883
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:18,269
right very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the construct on a</font>

884
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:21,058
56 box itself right there's you have

885
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:22,520
these these addresses that if if you're

886
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:24,050
unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use them you know</font>

887
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,080
kind of randomized to some extent but

888
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,460
randomized isn't really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best word we</font>

889
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:34,640
have the ability to transmit those with

890
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:41,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">dtp as well okay so any questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so far</font>

891
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:44,480
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> good okay so renewal rebinding saying</font>

892
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,770
simple similar contracts constructs we

893
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,960
talked a little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

894
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:50,830
when we kind of did a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rundown</font>

895
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,510
of how do we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> for preferred lifetimes</font>

896
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:58,190
I'm sorry valid lifetimes to prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

897
00:40:53,510 --> 00:41:01,970
t1 to t2 right we renew at t1 we're

898
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:04,250
buying to t2 and the note itself at the

899
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:09,399
valve lifetime should should cease using

900
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:11,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> address now something to note your</font>

901
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">renewal is going to be is going to be</font>

902
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,340
multicast it's going to be multicast on

903
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,150
a local link right so your real agents

904
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:21,980
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now pick up your renewals</font>

905
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,110
consistently right because in before

906
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,110
land they'll get unicast generally to

907
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,640
the DSP server right so if you expect to

908
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,650
see information about your real agents

909
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,330
it's part of that renewal process and

910
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:37,010
before they do you generally don't you

911
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:40,940
lose that right in v6 by I don't think

912
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:45,280
about default but almost by default you

913
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,280
visit the behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'll observe</font>

914
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:57,299
okay so we have renewal we're buying

915
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:00,270
messages I have a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> if would be</font>

916
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:03,060
of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> value to you folks here if we</font>

917
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,980
made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wireshark versions</font>

918
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,970
of these traces available so that you

919
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,349
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually open them up and actually</font>

920
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,450
you know take a look at the packets

921
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:11,880
themselves but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that you</font>

922
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:13,980
think would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful just kinda maybe</font>

923
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,720
drop a note to me because you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

924
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,460
address at the at the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

925
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,919
I'll I'll make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> available because</font>

926
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing that that I'm i noticed</font>

927
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,270
that we're losing here and in your we're

928
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:27,050
not really getting a good feel for the

929
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:30,000
encoding different'<font color="#CCCCCC"> TSA's that are</font>

930
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">dedicated for me sex right if you were</font>

931
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,599
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into sniffer yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

932
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">would jump at you right away so now</font>

933
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,410
that's something that's generally

934
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:45,240
applicable through all these these texts

935
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:49,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">to traces rebind i'm not going to bore</font>

936
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:53,089
you guys there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so server preference</font>

937
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:56,550
interesting option and coincidentally

938
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the attributes that could be used</font>

939
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide under these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bb6 servers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

940
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,210
so server preference is essentially

941
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,440
something you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

942
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:09,359
and you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to suggest to clients</font>

943
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:13,230
that one server is more preferred to

944
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:16,729
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay generally 0225 the values</font>

945
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:18,720
if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 255 day</font>

946
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:21,808
if you have multiple ones that are two

947
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,979
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 255 then basically the clients choose</font>

948
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:27,569
based on you know you know option sets

949
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:30,390
that come back in the advertisements for

950
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:32,579
speed of response you know for example

951
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">if to DCP servers that are have 255</font>

952
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:38,039
preference send back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a client</font>

953
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:40,799
advertisement same exact opposite but

954
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:45,299
one gets there somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot faster than</font>

955
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:48,239
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll take that right what we</font>

956
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:49,769
do here just as an aside so so we start

957
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,630
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about different constructs and</font>

958
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:54,238
we're building up to we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> building up</font>

959
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:56,089
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pieces that ultimately will put</font>

960
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">together towards the end to show you how</font>

961
00:43:56,089 --> 00:44:01,109
some ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could put you can</font>

962
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:05,430
offer a redundant<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACP this is what we do</font>

963
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:07,499
to basically encourage traffic to go to

964
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,839
one server compared to another right

965
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:11,879
instead of instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

966
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,979
equitably distributed between<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC servers</font>

967
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,160
maybe we want to always be preferred

968
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:20,098
over another so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font>

969
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,420
more truth from a data point view right

970
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:23,039
instead of having to kind of go and talk

971
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,880
to multiple you servers all the time

972
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:29,849
right so one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we that you'll</font>

973
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,589
see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the examples later on we'll have</font>

974
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:33,390
the guy that we called a primary right

975
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:35,400
to pull cut to pull kind of nomenclature

976
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,529
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> b4 land will have the primary</font>

977
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,450
have the 255 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have what we call</font>

978
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:42,299
the secondary server I have something

979
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,098
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 255 maybe 128 probably nonzero</font>

980
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:45,390
for 128 so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

981
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:48,089
differentiate between two days<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

982
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:50,249
servers because we do call one at least

983
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:53,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">in my experience we call one primary on</font>

984
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:53,149
one secondary right

985
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:59,538
okay so reconfigure one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

986
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:01,640
that we've had with with force renew and

987
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:05,599
before land is there seems to be a

988
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:09,828
pretty decent opportunity for exposure

989
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:12,859
there to have clients renewal forced on

990
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:15,740
a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of undesired</font>

991
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:17,930
right it was kind of uncontrolled with

992
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:23,390
reconfigure what we have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font>

993
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:26,480
to fairly nicely control the triggering

994
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:29,750
of a renewal or rewind event from the

995
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">dhcp server right you have to implement</font>

996
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:36,950
the reconfiguration key authentication

997
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:38,569
protocol and it is important important

998
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,919
important to note<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do not have</font>

999
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,190
to implement these ability of

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,880
authentication as specified Thursday 15

1001
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:48,109
we've had a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

1002
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementers freaked out because they</font>

1003
00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:52,670
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to go and do all of</font>

1004
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:56,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">dhcp authentication for v6 because it is</font>

1005
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:57,980
it is lengthy it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work this is</font>

1006
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a subset of that and in my</font>

1007
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:05,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">opinion worthwhile from for whatever</font>

1008
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:07,038
that's worth my two cents<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll give</font>

1009
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you a perfect example why so would be</font>

1010
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,660
six now you've got this vast address

1011
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:14,180
space what are you gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it well</font>

1012
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:16,308
why not extend the leases that you offer

1013
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:19,720
to clients and have them hardly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

1014
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:19,720
come back and review to you

1015
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,930
that we configure you have a problem

1016
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,660
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to manually reboot then</font>

1017
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:28,960
we're wait for half of infinity for it

1018
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,670
to renew well you basically lose contact

1019
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,980
with the computer right or the core

1020
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,940
decline well you can now extend those

1021
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:39,490
bindings potentially reduce some

1022
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,990
overhead on your DSP servers primary

1023
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:43,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network not that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much but it still</font>

1024
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and if you ever need to do</font>

1025
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,350
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trigger a reconfiguration</font>

1026
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:50,590
the client you leverage reconfigure

00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:52,000
right send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message does renew if you</font>

1028
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:54,220
need to change its lifetime sortie

1029
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,920
bindings temporarily there you go you

1030
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,689
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and after after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all said</font>

1031
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,710
done you just put it back to the way it

1032
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:04,450
was and off you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1033
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,560
an opportunity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have it be safe</font>

1034
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,480
said we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to be</font>

1035
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,740
portrayed because of all the churn great

1036
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,720
you know particularly in larger

1037
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,680
environments there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hyperspace</font>

1038
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:17,709
changing on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network right 12 B 6 I</font>

1039
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,440
put a 64<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it seemed TS well that's 64</font>

1040
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:21,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">i expects gonna stay there for a while</font>

1041
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know probably for the lifetime of</font>

1042
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,820
the box

1043
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:31,850
and over time as as dtp continues to

1044
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:33,670
mature and evolve we can we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1045
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,900
advantage some of the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1046
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,090
opportunities that we have rate extend

1047
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,170
those leases used ESP reconfigure so

1048
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,090
that we ever need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back and touch</font>

1049
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:42,680
we can write and we can we could affect

1050
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:45,950
change on the client in the controlled

1051
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:52,549
secure matter right I think there's an

1052
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:54,379
opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> every question all right</font>

1053
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:58,190
so so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start kind of</font>

1054
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:01,940
getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the the kind of the</font>

1055
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:03,440
tail end of the dry boring kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of core</font>

1056
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:07,550
protocol stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting into some of</font>

1057
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,040
the the docsis pieces of things so

1058
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:12,350
vendor information options you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

1059
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,820
that there are not nearly as many DCP

1060
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,460
option for v6 that there are correct

1061
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:18,620
before not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only because you know it's</font>

1062
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,330
still relatively new but because we have

1063
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:23,390
this thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> meander gravy on thick</font>

1064
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:27,080
veil so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you know with</font>

1065
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:29,569
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we four years now have overloaded</font>

1066
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,890
grossly a lot of before options to kind

1067
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,970
of represent different things to

1068
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:34,910
different people to different

1069
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:38,419
implementers right option 64 cable

1070
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:39,859
modems has a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff on the</font>

1071
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,450
back end that means something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

1072
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,740
capable fryer doesn't mean anybody

1073
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:48,710
anything to to an enterprise person so

1074
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:51,049
DS BB 6 33 15 makes available this

1075
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to kind of spent its kind of get</font>

1076
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:57,380
yourself a vendor a vendor a vendor ID

1077
00:48:53,930 --> 00:49:00,049
and you now are authoritative for your

1078
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:02,120
own DSP options right so using cable as

1079
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:05,300
an example for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable industry we</font>

1080
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,730
have 4491 as our vendor ID and we have

1081
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:11,090
specified through our specifications

1082
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:14,550
work a substantial number of DTV v6

1083
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">options under our own ID and cable</font>

1084
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:18,450
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of make things</font>

1085
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,320
happen from a v6 point of view

1086
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:25,109
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> birdies bb6 point of view and</font>

1087
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,910
support the deployment right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font>

1088
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:30,060
to set a boot file to the cable modem

1089
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:32,339
well I have a boot file option with its

1090
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:35,220
own code under 4491<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's unique to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1091
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if your dsl guy you're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1092
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:40,049
you're highly likely that you're going

1093
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,180
to use the boot file option if you use

1094
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the boot file under my my vendor code</font>

1095
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,660
4491 you're gonna go you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

1096
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,970
roll your own right maybe the broadband

1097
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,710
forum has their own their own vendor ID

1098
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,580
is very important because the other

1099
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:54,720
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done what about this thing</font>

1100
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:57,540
here is there's a lot of back and forth

1101
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,910
about this right some people say well no

1102
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:02,810
there's there's an absence of kind of

1103
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:06,629
control here there's an absence of the

1104
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity to kind of kind of overseen</font>

1105
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,140
shape how options are defined right but

1106
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,879
other people at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time say well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1107
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,259
really like to flexibility but I don't

1108
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,990
want to wait three years with these for

1109
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:18,360
the ITF to the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of specifying option</font>

1110
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,910
right all depends on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> side of the</font>

1111
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,990
fence you're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on right so</font>

1112
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:24,120
important point to note now something

1113
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:25,500
that's not in here that's worth

1114
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:29,190
mentioning is kind of relate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1115
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:32,160
there are vendor messages vendor message

1116
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:35,130
types that where there has been work

1117
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,799
related to vendor messages proposed into

1118
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:40,410
the DS your group idea right similar

1119
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,770
idea but now just message types not just

1120
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,770
options

1121
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:50,540
so before v6 coexistence for<font color="#CCCCCC"> gentlemen</font>

1122
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,830
that left this is largely what we fast

1123
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:55,759
forward it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know what do you want</font>

1124
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:57,740
to put same you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know same server</font>

1125
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,690
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> server same process different</font>

1126
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:04,160
process you know how how do you want to

1127
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,430
deploy DS p6 if you're going to use it

1128
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,750
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it really is on case-by-case basis</font>

1129
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,330
right you know everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> has different</font>

1130
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:13,250
constraints you know putting up putting

1131
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,480
up pregnancies bb6 on a separate server

1132
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,850
requires you to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1133
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,680
buying out their servers right so you

1134
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,360
know in tough times maybe budgetarily

1135
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,960
you know budget budget wise that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1136
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:30,730
an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know it's it's a</font>

1137
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:30,730
case by case all right let's see here

1138
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:41,250
alright so we went through a lot of

1139
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things here and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

1140
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:46,430
kind of waste too much time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

1141
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,260
let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the redundancy</font>

1142
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:51,060
business here so like I'd mentioned

1143
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:55,830
multiple times there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no protocol to</font>

1144
00:51:51,060 --> 00:52:00,600
DSP be supervised it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of there's</font>

1145
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:03,029
no protocol doesn't exist but in in any

1146
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:05,339
environment we need redundancy in some

1147
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:07,710
way shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> or form right so some of the</font>

1148
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:10,140
work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had done and you know</font>

1149
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:12,090
someday soon hopefully we will pose at

1150
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:14,250
least an informational document in you

1151
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:17,510
know ITF that actually outlines this

1152
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,510
little more detail

1153
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,529
we had to do some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

1154
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:29,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can leverage servers that</font>

1155
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:31,710
supports protocol as it is today yet get

1156
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:34,109
closer to being redundant right I'll be

1157
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,210
the first tell you it's not perfect it's

1158
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:38,190
not foolproof it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it</font>

1159
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's no there's no kind of</font>

1160
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:42,869
inter server communication that really

1161
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:53,038
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lab for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the exchange of</font>

1162
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:56,220
state right combination of using range

1163
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:58,170
subsets server preference and multiple

1164
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:00,359
servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so all along the lab and</font>

1165
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:02,190
talk to you guys about okay well you

1166
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:03,180
have two days be servers maybe one has a

1167
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,950
higher preference another one who

1168
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,509
doesn't right well so let's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dig</font>

1169
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,519
into that a little bit deeper<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're</font>

1170
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:12,260
configured with the same /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 is the</font>

1171
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:16,109
range essentially depending on how the

1172
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:18,960
server determines<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 64 bit 64 bits for</font>

1173
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:21,900
an interface ID I'll never statistically

1174
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,789
I may never have a duplication and even

1175
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:27,480
if i get the climate appliance right of

1176
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:29,730
the tech those decline the advertisement

1177
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,079
and try again<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we have the end</font>

1178
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:37,319
appreciated you know the largeness of

1179
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:38,250
64-bit prefix and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> and which are</font>

1180
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,930
opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that for that</font>

1181
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,670
duplication right so in the very

1182
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,140
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about well just have</font>

1183
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,849
overlapping prefixes your sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1184
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,890
talking about overlapping prefixes on

1185
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:49,380
one or more DSP servers leveraging

1186
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,420
preference to control which<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP server</font>

1187
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:55,500
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority most authoritative for</font>

1188
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,820
those binary certainly would work

1189
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,560
I can tell you that you know you know

1190
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:02,580
testing these things in the lab it works

1191
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,009
well you can go a step further and say

1192
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:07,290
well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really want my PSP servers</font>

1193
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:09,150
to have some way some form of uniqueness

1194
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:12,090
when they allocate addresses so you can

1195
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:15,180
take a 64 a sign of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2d servers but now</font>

1196
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:16,530
peel back and create a unique range on

1197
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,819
HTTP servers right so now you

1198
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:20,100
essentially have this notion of split

1199
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:23,960
scopes so anybody who's been around<font color="#CCCCCC"> East</font>

1200
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe for long enough before the ETP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1201
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">for failover draft you know kind of</font>

1202
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,150
cocktail version 13 and never<font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

1203
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:35,010
anywhere the the use of split scopes was

1204
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,720
people use the more private<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font>

1205
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,860
that you waste events that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in</font>

1206
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,169
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you waste address because you</font>

1207
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,880
really don't have want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be 6 you've</font>

1208
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:44,100
got played a waste and unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

1209
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,530
encouraging in a wasted but you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1210
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to basically say i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1211
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">put a slash 65 on one server the other</font>

1212
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:54,660
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> that 65 on the other server</font>

1213
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:56,520
different preferences right and now all

1214
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:58,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the addresses that get allocated on that</font>

1215
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,330
server are unique right so now for

1216
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,480
operational purposes of troubleshooting

1217
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,920
or to support deployment now you can

1218
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,210
differentiate<font color="#E5E5E5"> now look that address came</font>

1219
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,460
from server a that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> came from</font>

1220
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:13,170
server be right and it's fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious</font>

1221
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:15,300
right get just too high level models

1222
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:18,600
right like I said you could you could

1223
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,670
take this as far as saying I want to

1224
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:23,040
have n number of DHCP servers

1225
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:25,410
participating this you know redundant

1226
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,450
kind of model just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to be</font>

1227
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:29,490
too right I mean if you take the first

1228
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">scenario where you have a sly 64 and you</font>

1229
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:34,629
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five servers each with a</font>

1230
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:36,670
different preference you know you

1231
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,140
have essentially a form of five g's B

1232
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,880
servers that are all actively

1233
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,868
participating in the act of allocating

1234
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:48,759
addresses these<font color="#E5E5E5"> be clients any questions</font>

1235
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:50,470
about redundancy here for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> pv6 now</font>

1236
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:52,509
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing I will I will note</font>

1237
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:56,890
before year too far off this it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

1238
00:55:52,509 --> 00:55:59,259
solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem of availability of</font>

1239
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:02,230
data not related to these<font color="#CCCCCC"> peak lines</font>

1240
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:05,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so now just bear with me we have</font>

1241
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:08,319
to DC servers one of them's getting on

1242
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:09,670
the action he dies and I have a system

1243
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:13,509
let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to him to get</font>

1244
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:15,549
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and he plays down I'm</font>

1245
00:56:13,509 --> 00:56:17,769
not getting any information right so I I

1246
00:56:15,549 --> 00:56:19,660
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to him to allow to allow</font>

1247
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:21,189
clients to register and kind of you know

1248
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,420
you know to do the neck thing on the

1249
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,000
network it's my sister best example I

1250
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,710
can offer that's pretty generic<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I</font>

1251
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,660
have a problem that right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

1252
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:32,170
crashed now what am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do right</font>

1253
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:36,160
so if you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this scenario rocks</font>

1254
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:39,460
telling you<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier we could adjust we</font>

1255
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:43,058
could adjust any various timers and

1256
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:46,029
lifetimes you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself how do I</font>

1257
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:48,789
get data to the other active server how

1258
00:56:46,029 --> 00:56:52,079
do I get it current now right so what

1259
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:54,640
you'll find is if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the</font>

1260
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">the valid in preferred lifetime very</font>

1261
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:01,868
very almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> equal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to one another and</font>

1262
00:56:56,849 --> 00:57:04,750
make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the t2 timer very near in value</font>

1263
00:57:01,869 --> 00:57:08,140
to the preferred lifetime you'll find

1264
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:11,109
that once the client tries to renew and

1265
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,600
can against the original server but wait

1266
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:14,670
wait wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout</font>

1267
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,620
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then shoot over to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second server</font>

1268
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:20,250
right so that gets you back to a place

1269
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:23,490
where now you have shortened amount of

1270
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,600
time of the absence of data right so

1271
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:26,189
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these type of things that</font>

1272
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,460
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of had to explore how to dig</font>

1273
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:30,990
into making sure that we reduce our

1274
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,760
exposure I guess that's the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

1275
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:34,439
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the exposure for the actions work</font>

1276
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:38,340
for the not availability of data right

1277
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:40,410
so you know just consideration<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1278
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,540
we're done is a point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> view and this</font>

1279
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide here actually talks about exactly</font>

1280
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,860
that we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adjustment of</font>

00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:49,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different timers in the lifetime you</font>

1283
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:55,230
split scope split ranges or overlapping

1284
00:57:51,120 --> 00:58:00,120
ranges right all that's kind of what's

1285
00:57:55,230 --> 00:58:04,050
up here now so what these are at this

1286
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">point is configuration examples for</font>

00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:08,930
redundancy for each of the models we

<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are icy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DP</font>

1289
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:15,899
configuration files I used I basically

1290
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:17,970
took and made it 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> deviate address space</font>

1291
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,900
instead of my own so you'll have to you

1292
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,950
know if you choose to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these you'll</font>

1293
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,200
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some adjustments kind of</font>

1294
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:23,970
drive with what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network but</font>

1295
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,919
these will work these are taken directly

1296
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:29,970
from servers in a lab where they were

1297
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:32,400
functioning and there's a couple

1298
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">examples for these be at least two</font>

1299
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,180
examples for the two different

1300
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,080
approaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to play I</font>

1301
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,569
would encourage you to go ahead and do

1302
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:43,799
so and try some different gyrations you

1303
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:46,190
notice here no different preferences

1304
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,190
here

1305
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,070
and he and this has happened to be one

1306
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:56,690
we have overlapping 64's this one back

1307
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:59,290
here we have 65 so you actually get

1308
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:02,630
allocated unique addresses again

1309
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:09,529
different preferences and just

1310
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:11,180
engineering Cotton's up top here so some

1311
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:14,330
acknowledgments here and like I said

1312
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:16,870
there's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with diddler I've</font>

1313
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:20,110
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pleasure to work with the IC</font>

1314
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:23,210
done some work with tahi and the UNH iol

1315
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:26,300
and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm familiar with</font>

1316
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:31,070
the you know the cisco see<font color="#E5E5E5"> NRDC server</font>

1317
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:32,810
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as some others so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font>

1318
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:38,650
with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> DCP server configurations</font>

1319
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:42,850
these are pretty generic not redundancy

1320
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:42,850
how do you how you started

1321
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,020

1322
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:52,260
configuration files<font color="#CCCCCC"> wells kind of</font>

1323
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:54,070
commands to start it and the relay agent

1324
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:58,300
took me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while to figure this one out</font>

1325
00:59:54,070 --> 01:00:00,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relay agent if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1327
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:07,420
actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> question out there pretty</font>

1328
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:17,020
funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so real quick anybody</font>

1329
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:21,310
have a time check okay okay so what

1330
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:23,710
comes this is go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 k 6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1331
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:26,590
so some terminology we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font>

1332
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:28,090
a quick or go through some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1333
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,500
generic slicers because it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

1334
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,730
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of interactive especially</font>

1335
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,370
about talks do you think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1336
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:34,510
right to that so just some some

1337
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:41,589
terminology just so we're on the same

1338
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:44,020
page k below seems yes that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kimmo</font>

01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,620
in our environment while we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> mta's</font>

1343
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:00,030
for mail this is actually the the device

is the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> over cable system interface</font>

1347
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:11,880
specification that basically defines how

1348
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:15,370
we do IP / docs / / / docsis or RF

1349
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:18,280
package cable the actual technology that

1350
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:21,279
is used for voice in most cable

1351
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:23,740

act of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing DCP but also in the cable</font>

and time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of day also use heavily in</font>

1360
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
boxes so pointers to specifications that

1361
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,759
are should be publicly available if you

1362
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,770
wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read them and you are insomniac</font>

1363
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:59,020
and an overview of docsis right so let's

1364
01:01:53,770 --> 01:02:00,340
dig into this real quick so we have we

1365
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:04,600
have the ability to support out to be 6

1366
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:06,190
in docsis 3.0 right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly new</font>

1367
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,450
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our dachshund specifications</font>

1368
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:11,260
but we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to support</font>

1369
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:13,540
ipv6 in some legacy devices that are

1370
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:16,230
what we call 20 base right so some of

1371
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,970
the pointers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gave you two documents</font>

1372
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:21,550
will tell you will give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

1373
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:24,339

1375
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:33,820
in short to bring original cable them

1377
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,780
about it right so there's there's some

1378
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:39,700
syslog options and<font color="#E5E5E5"> semester</font>

1381
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:47,940
to actually bring the device online

1382
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:51,940
stains will dhcp is generally required

1383
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:56,500

1419
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:54,690
important so we care about it so this

1420
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:56,249
device identifier is actually 248 bit

1421
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,809
mac address of the kit model that gets

1422
01:04:56,249 --> 01:05:01,189
transmitted as part of these vb6

1423
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:03,420
exchange under<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own enterprise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

1424
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:05,940
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own capabilities and these</font>

1425
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:09,180
are basically kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bag of bits that</font>

1426
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:12,299
tells it's an encoded list of option or

1427
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:13,859
bits that basically once decoded will

1428
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:18,180
tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the modem is</font>

1429
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:20,910
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda do flips whatever you know</font>

1430
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:26,089
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just features so to speak kind of use</font>

1431
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:28,980
a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of to be blunt about it and in</font>

1432
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">cmps now we also transmit information</font>

1433
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:33,240
about the same test itself we transmit

1434
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,360
information about the docsis version

1435
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:38,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">cmps can support as well as the cable</font>

1438
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:45,660
so we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that that's actually</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">his modem supports reconfigure okay you</font>

1448
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:29,759
didn't see that in kind of the regular

1449
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:34,700
client illustrations huh this actually

1450
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:37,260
is worth gone through vendor class yeah

1451
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:38,910
that's working out in here blow all the

1452
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,770
traces that you saw before it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1453
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:44,069
human<font color="#CCCCCC"> readable format right I'll look</font>

1456
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:50,990
here cares about boxes here we get a lot

1457
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:53,670
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> in wireshark because the</font>

1458
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:56,669
decoders and wires harp haven't been

1459
01:06:53,670 --> 01:07:00,150
built yet to decode all the different

1460
01:06:56,670 --> 01:07:02,190
options for that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a BB 6 tcp right</font>

1461
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:04,020
so in here you would see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1462
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:06,960
said dachshunds to point out doc says

1463
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:09,900
3.5 vendor pleasant note all right

1464

<font color="#E5E5E5">it commits it's there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do it but we</font>

1466
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:19,430
don't go there really agent happy

1467
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:27,549
what else we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got here so this is a</font>

1468
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:33,730
better illustration of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wireshark</font>

1469
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:36,940
encode these<font color="#E5E5E5"> PP six packets properly 44</font>

1470
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:39,970
docsis means nothing

1471
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:42,089
unless you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have fat and I less decking</font>

1472
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:48,220
on purpose not to be obnoxious either so

1473
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:50,200
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of these things here we have</font>

1474
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:53,470
some additional vendor information off

1475
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:57,700
to the right there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for what it's</font>

1476
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:59,859
worth these options here under other

1477
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:02,410
vendor information 517 we have our own

1478
01:07:59,859 --> 01:08:05,440
enterprise entity under here is where we

1479
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:09,509
have the docsis<font color="#CCCCCC"> oro and other attributes</font>

1480
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,510
that are terrific is barb docsis

1481
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:17,950
ok

1482
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:24,820
so the advertised I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into and then</font>

1483
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:26,890
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to skip to reconfigure and then I</font>

1484
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we'll end on that so if you look</font>

1485
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:32,560
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the advertised part of this this</font>

1486
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:34,770
transaction for a cable modem this one

1487
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,770
doesn't

1488
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:43,000
interesting this one well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope we</font>

1489
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,789
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford it so over here is where we</font>

1490
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,948
would set back in this business back of

1491
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:49,988
its over here we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like our</font>

1492
01:08:47,948 --> 01:08:56,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue cloud the teeth to be server ipv6</font>

1494
01:08:56,049 --> 01:09:05,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this room a good point bring a bigger</font>

1495
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,549
except right so

1496
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:10,310
the intention<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is to illustrate how</font>

1497
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:13,279
we've leveraged vendor information

1498
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,720
options that we specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bardock says to</font>

1499
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,608
bring these devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> unity to allow these</font>

1500
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:20,299
devices to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be provisioned using the HP</font>

1501
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:24,020
v6 and support<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I'll do is</font>

1502
01:09:20,299 --> 01:09:29,269
I'll jump to the tail end here and talk

1503
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:32,089
about reconfigure so in reconfigure what

1504
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:35,630
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice here is GC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server is</font>

1505
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:37,880
instructed somehow whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes</font>

1506
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:40,480
from vendor to vendor to basically issue

1507
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:43,160
a reconfigure message to decline<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1508
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:45,559
guess its client and essentially all all

1509
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,358
that all that message<font color="#E5E5E5"> does assess the</font>

1510
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,760
client if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept this message and</font>

1511
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:55,430
it's properly encrypted and also the

1512
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:56,690
business renew or rebond did right so

1513
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:59,390
the client still has to go through the

1514
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:00,589
renewal process to actually put forth a

1515
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,880
trigger figure to take effect right so

1516
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:03,920
that's that's the best where you

1517
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,990
basically say I've made<font color="#CCCCCC"> a change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1518
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,300
HP server for this client or for these

1519
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:10,639
clients down here issue the reconfigure

1520
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:13,310
to have the change take effect using the

1521
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,250
removal using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> renown right these</font>

1522
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:18,320
traces here are exactly that message

1523
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:20,690
flow and are in a real dachshunds

1524
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,790
environment so you follow these guys

1525
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:24,589
through and your and find that you'll

1526
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:31,000
see the reconfigure mrs. go out and then

1527
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:33,820
the request in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reply come in okay so</font>

1528
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:39,830
questions comments

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so all these examples to the end</font>

1549
01:11:56,830 --> 01:12:03,559
this is a cable modem from I forget who

1550
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:05,260
but it's not be fine it's some other

1551
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:10,270
piece behind the opinion a cable modem

1552
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:14,830
this was a cisco CBS and this was

1553
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:14,830
probably sis cocinar DCP

1554
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:25,480

01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:34,430
yeah yeah but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling is this</font>

1571
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:35,630
right if you if you listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to admire you</font>

1572
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:38,300
know some of the guys we're talking at

1573
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:40,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the main hall help me a</font>

1574
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,570
couple days ago or yesterday you know if

1575
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about some of the alternatives</font>

1576
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:47,660
to where we're going right you know

1577
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:48,980
character in<font color="#CCCCCC"> eggs or even whether your</font>

1578
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,470
respective how you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them right</font>

1579
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:53,209
yeah you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't take a lot of</font>

1580
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:54,680
thought to figure out what the

1581
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:58,190
implications that are pretty substantial

1582
01:13:54,680 --> 01:14:00,470
right so my feeling you know if it be

1583
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:01,790
the kind of not answer that question

1584
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:05,000
would be is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think there</font>

1585
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:08,750
really is like a well if i go to be six

1586
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,250
I get you know something cool at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

1587
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:12,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I think the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

1588
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,700
like that is if i go to be six I get to

1589
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,500
keep the internet the way I know and

1590
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,670
love it today right I get to you know I

1591
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,410
get to get to a place in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future</font>

1592
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:20,450
where you know you know the things that

1593
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:23,450
I do happily today on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet stay</font>

1594
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:26,090
that way only her head<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow right</font>

1595
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:28,250
unless we start down this down this just

1596
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:32,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">pit you know start or continue down this</font>

1597
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:34,310
path you know sooner rather later you

1598
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:37,460
know it scares me on a personal note you

1599
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:38,390
know right any hat off on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal</font>

1600
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">note that someone who cares deeply about</font>

1601
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:42,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it kind of scares me what</font>

1602
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:44,760
what to think you know could happen in

1603
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:48,360
the not since the future

1604
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:52,020
so I look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> downside of things that</font>

1605
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:54,089
could become as more of a motivator it's

1606
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:58,610
kind of given the ball with these vb6

1607
01:14:54,090 --> 01:15:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">936 vs no I have the opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

1608
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:05,489
you know some food and be yes the

1609
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:08,119
wealthy other Sullivan

1610
01:15:05,489 --> 01:15:08,119
I mean

1611
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:29,540
well actually no i can actually talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1612
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:33,500
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that race we talked</font>

1613
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:36,110
about extending<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifetimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for Lisa story</font>

1614
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:38,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can tell you that that that there's</font>

1615
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:42,290
there's potential to kind of kind of

1616
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:44,270
improve how networks are operated on a

1617
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:48,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">day-to-day basis right another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

1618
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:49,909
of that is right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it's always</font>

1619
01:15:48,139 --> 01:15:52,699
journaling that work Greg I got this

1620
01:15:49,909 --> 01:15:54,259
size 23 and I rolled up change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mass</font>

1621
01:15:52,699 --> 01:15:56,509
you know put a new actress<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bezier do</font>

1622
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:59,150
some stuff server<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happen all time</font>

1623
01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:04,070
every day right well now put a 64 out

1624
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:06,019
there I'm never after that right I mean

1625
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:07,670
that helps simplify the way that you

1626
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:11,030
that you operate and run a network right

1627
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:12,139
to two very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple examples right but</font>

1628
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:15,889
I'm telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mean like them before</font>

1629
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:18,070
all that stuff happen every day right

1630
01:16:15,889 --> 01:16:21,110
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to tomorrow</font>

1631
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:24,330
necessarily but I mean but unless you

1632
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:27,809
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 million modems you don't care</font>

1633
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:29,340
I care you know people who work in big

1634
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:31,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that have big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gossip at</font>

1635
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:31,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">work they care</font>

1636
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:39,100
I mean so let me do I

1637
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:44,250
is that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> massive hair first</font>

1638
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,929
that's really

1639
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:55,790
network

1640
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:00,200
that is

1641
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,610
of course

1642
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:28,780
Wow but that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true either i</font>

1643
01:17:27,099 --> 01:17:30,250
mean i can go down low you why database

1644
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:31,900
and I could potentially mathematically

1645
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:34,150
calculate every every address on the

1646
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:36,429
planet you know because i only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1647
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:39,549
only have what we call it 24 bits to

1648
01:17:36,429 --> 01:17:41,769
just smash around there right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then i</font>

1649
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:45,809
can basically predetermine every<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 bit</font>

1650
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:45,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">into something i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1651
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:55,500
no I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say I mean I I know the</font>

1652
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:57,630
