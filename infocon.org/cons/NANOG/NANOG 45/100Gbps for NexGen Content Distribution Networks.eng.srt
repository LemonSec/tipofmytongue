00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:34,410

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,169
preaching the choir here we see video

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,960
growing a very fast and video of course

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,430
is a huge fan with driver people are

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,039
willing to pay for it especially high

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,920

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,949
domain we did a couple of modelling

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,079
scenarios and we believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> within a</font>

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,730
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years in the metro access portion</font>

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,640

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,209
video and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case even if you</font>

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,000
and even if you store<font color="#CCCCCC"> a popular content</font>

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,420
very close to consumer that comes from

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">the long tail in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video distribution</font>

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,580
so that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> good we really love</font>

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,798
my company loves the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sella bandwidth and</font>

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,210
I guess your company probably loves to

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,200
sell bandwidth as well so that's good

30
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:26,699
for all of us now video has some pretty

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,729
important requirements you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have</font>

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,000
low latency for a good picture quality

33
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,799
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have a very resilient</font>

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,170
network but then also there are a couple

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,960
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be easier with video</font>

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,810
for instance you can optimize<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,169
network in an asymmetric way to take

<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the I mean that that you</font>

39
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,700

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,470
with all the important bandwidth drivers

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,630

45
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,039
religious battle between what should be

the next ethernet standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> today it's</font>

advocating for<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea Gigabit Ethernet and</font>

50
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,929
then there were the more visionary

people who are advocating<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hana gigabit</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">end came together and they will be both</font>

gigabit ethernet standard and that's for

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,000
my company that's perfectly fine we

63
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,060
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Holly gigabit will be cost</font>

67
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,730
help both 40 gigabit and Hana gigabit 40

68
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,500
gigabit today is<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty expensive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

69
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,429
compared to tangu bit but prices<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,530
coming down so what what are the

71
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,700
benefits for honey gigabit networking if

72
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,260
you look today's<font color="#CCCCCC"> riders they reaching</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">terabit a multiple tera bit of camp at</font>

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,519
capacity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the capacity is actually</font>

75
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,330
not limited by the switching capacity

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,209
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hana gigabit will help there to</font>

79
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,859
get the full switching capacity you

80
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,740
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have logical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hana</font>

81
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,860
gigabit ports but still use 10 gigabit

82
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:46,400
transport and that's being done today

83
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,590
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is expensive eventually the</font>

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,740
higher speed and faces always or cheaper

85
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,770
on the perfect basis it's also better to

86
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:58,730
have higher speed ports just for the

87
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:01,120
stat muxing gains if you stack mocks up

88
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,290
to hana gigabit you get much better

89
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,200
efficiencies than if you have to stand

90
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:09,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">blocks only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to 10 gig and finally in</font>

91
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,959
your WM network and each channel burns

92
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,970
out the wavelength so clearly if you go

93
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,709
at hana gigabit you're going to burn up

94
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,970
10 times<font color="#CCCCCC"> less wavelengths so there are</font>

95
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,709
many benefits to conduct a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

96
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">networking just as there were benefits</font>

97
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,489
to 10 gigabit<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

98
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:26,888
five years ago when you look at

99
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,350
increasing capacity between point A and

100
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:32,889
point B there are several options you

101
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,570
have option number one is to increase

102
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,400
spectral efficiency so you have a

103
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,880
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of bandwidth and that's</font>

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,179
defined by your amplifier and just try

105
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,580
to cram more bits through this pain with

106
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,800
what you could also do is increase that

107
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,099
bandwidth use multiple amplifier<font color="#E5E5E5"> bands</font>

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,169
or also just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like another fiber now the</font>

109
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,580
latter two options usually are expensive

110
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:57,250
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always but usually you're expensive</font>

111
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,770
especially having multiple parallel

112
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,270
amplifiers so people really try to do is

113
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,880
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have higher spectral efficiency</font>

114
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,859
and that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what happened</font>

115
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,560
in your wireless them space to where

116
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">people just try to get more and more</font>

117
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,260
bits into a limited amount of bandwidth

118
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,949
if you look at all the requirements for

119
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,530
WM systems often you install a WM system

120
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,000
you don't know exactly what's the

121
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,190
traffic growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be so you</font>

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,110
lay that maybe 4 10 gigabit but then you

123
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,330
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to later on upgrade this 10 gigabit</font>

124
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">to 40 and politic a bit so your honey</font>

125
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,680

with a system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has it has been</font>

128
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,020
usually means it has to be it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit</font>

129
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,289
on a 50 gigahertz great that that's this

130
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,240
channel spacing of dwm channels it also

131
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,430
has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through Rome's Rotom zar</font>

132
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,440
devices or like oculus which is where

133
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can direct</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wavelength channels</font>

need a shorter it's very simple optical

159

160
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,240
bandwidth and typically a 10 gigabit

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,460
system requires 10 gigahertz band with a

162
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,320
40 gigabit system requires forty

gigahertz of bandwidth and the whole new

164
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,520

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,760
this as you go higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> and higher engine</font>

168
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,960
speed this becomes much much more

169
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,090
difficult what's also true is that if

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,340
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a high bandwidth all your</font>

173
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,590
the more bandwidth you having the signal

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,000
the more distortions you get so what

175
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,820
what is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantageous at hana</font>

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,760
gigabit is to use a more complex

177
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,190
modulation format where you get multiple

178
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,620

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,690
basically modulating the amplitude of

the signal by modulating the phase of

<font color="#CCCCCC">the signal and by modulating the</font>

183

bits person per symbol the price you pay

184
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,210
is much more complex receivers and

185
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,870

186
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:01,049
transmission hardware now if you go

187
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,790
again if you go to higher higher more

complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> modulation format what usually</font>

189
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:10,590
improves is the transmission performance

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:12,780
so all the distortions or have less of

191
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,919
an effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't walk you through the</font>

193
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,380

<font color="#E5E5E5">Honda gigabit has roughly the</font>

196
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,370
performance in terms of transmission of

200
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,919
has to be

201
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,348
sophisticated modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> format</font>

202

210

<font color="#E5E5E5">you modulate amplitude phase and</font>

the fiber here carries 16 terabytes of

then just by optical filtering you can

what's called optical packet switching

probably most channels are filled and

you don't need to have a

demo we did a few years ago at ng doing

350
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,709
exactly there one key technology you

351
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:38,170
need here is a laser<font color="#CCCCCC"> a transfer that can</font>

352
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,720
very quickly switch colors within a few

353
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,030
nanoseconds so you could really send

354
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,820
packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could really color your</font>

355

individual packets but those are those

lasers are available<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and you can</font>

357
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:55,420
indeed switch them very quickly so

takeaway messages from my talk video

359
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,099
will dominate network traffic that's

probably not anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is news to</font>

364
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:16,060
sort of a new modulation format that's

365

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> been used today at ng or 40 G what's</font>

366
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,520
really really important is that energy

367
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,880
is backward compatible and if you use an

368
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,160

378
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:58,089
because they allow you sub shell
