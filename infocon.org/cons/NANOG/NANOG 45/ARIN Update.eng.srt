1
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:07,560
well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much my presentation</font>

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,040
is gonna be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit different in</font>

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">ricardo's and that I Ricardo's is really</font>

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,230
comprehensive and it gave a lot more

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,810
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we we all should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,480
concerned about but my more has has

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,970
mostly more of an engineering focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,529
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reiterate that times are</font>

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,538
changing a little bit with the regional

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,779
registries they've been the same for 15

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,700
years but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a I a</font>

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,230
while Scott but white scale change

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,510
that's going to occur the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,419
years and this goes from governance and

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,550
the sort of challenges that has whether

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,610
or not the IT should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved or what</font>

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,169
happens to I can where does I n ago and

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,449
so for her so on and so forth but what I

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,820
wanted to do is talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit about</font>

20
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron and most y'all learn Aaron's</font>

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,719
reaching errands region by the way we're

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:04,229
actually in<font color="#CCCCCC"> lactic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> region right now</font>

23
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">erence region is North America basically</font>

24
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,590
united states and<font color="#CCCCCC"> canada and the</font>

25
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,759
english-speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> caribbean island so</font>

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll go ahead and get started at this</font>

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,490
point what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to talk about is give</font>

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,008
you some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of cool graphs kind</font>

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,390
of things I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show or sort</font>

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,369
of very media focus what we're planning

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,229
on working on and some of the challenges

32
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,299
and one of the things I like to do when

33
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we get into the challenges as if you</font>

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,479
sleep through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of it I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,070
you to wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges</font>

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,130
because there are some issues that

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,220
really will that your voice will be

38
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear as we go</font>

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,869
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> because Aaron is going to be</font>

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,070
changing and we like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input</font>

41
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:50,280
on weight it should go forward so here

42
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,529
you see our whois query load and it's

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,329
kind of like up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the right it's that</font>

44
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,950
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool graph that as</font>

45
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,439
internet grows you see a lot more

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,060
traffic and we're seeing just an

47
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,839
incredible amounts of traffic that's

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,180
hitting our whois servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and we're</font>

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,069
actually expanding our footprint to

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,400
various locations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we have a West</font>

51
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:13,280
Coast facility now and we've redone our

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,760
East Coast facility to actually

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,040
load we're over 100 queries per second

54
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,260
on who is and as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who came from</font>

55
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,609
verisign we're not at those numbers yet

56
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,980
in terms of what they saw in there who

57
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,990
is servers but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> readily approaching</font>

58
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:32,420
the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers that fair assigned</font>

59
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:35,959
seats on either come who is server the

60
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,649
routing registry query load this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind</font>

61
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:44,060
of trusting so where's the who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

62
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">for IP addresses is in the hundreds of</font>

63
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,519
queries per second this thing is like

64
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,250
chirping in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the woods the routing</font>

65
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,530
registry sees queries in the minute time

66
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,320
range and the spikes that you saw in the

67
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning was a researcher who kind of</font>

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,489
went a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy and after we</font>

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,430
finally figured out who that person was

70
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:06,500
we kind of showed him<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

71
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,380
you do it and actually everything kind

72
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sold down at that point so the these</font>

73
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:17,019
spikes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're very small</font>

74
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:18,980
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what who is he's regularly</font>

75
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,010
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing I like to show</font>

76
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,018
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the about two years ago</font>

77
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,899
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a policy that was actually put</font>

78
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,940
forward that said hey as part of the

79
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,680
template we also like to see the origin

80
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually included and so there's been</font>

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,790
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple times a</font>

82
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,600
year we'll go ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look to see</font>

83
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:44,209
whether or not if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AES is</font>

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually indeed correct within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rafi's</font>

85
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:52,730
and we're finding out that this is very

86
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,519
true for who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is actually very</font>

87
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:00,170
valid actually has pretty good correct

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">answers it has a lot more which is</font>

89
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,100
somewhat misleading because there could

90
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:05,780
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one and out one in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

91
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,140
announcement but hundreds of these who

92
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,880
is entries in it so that are covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

93
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,458
that winter out announcement but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,890
indeed correct because the origin is the

95
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the origin for that particular</font>

96
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:22,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and as you can see that the irr</font>

97
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,420
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

98
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,430
valid so the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it is you</font>

99
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,710
basically a fifty fifty percent chance

100
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:36,470
of getting the right information now the

101
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:38,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">IRR as we start going forward and</font>

102
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,860
everyone's talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the depletion</font>

103
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,140
of v4 and the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of v6 coming forward</font>

104
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,730
or maybe not coming forward what was

105
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happening is they're getting to</font>

106
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:53,060
be a land rush on on V for space and our

107
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,730
grass show that this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> true that</font>

108
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,440
we're actually flatlining right now so

109
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,190
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this land</font>

110
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,430
rush yet and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be coming</font>

111
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,910
but not yet go ahead Dave I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

112
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,890
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh if you look at the you know</font>

113
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,330
that curve of the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the growth of</font>

114
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the routing table over the last whatever</font>

115
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,620
ten or whatever yours<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Jeff Houston</font>

116
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,110
graph you notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it flattens out</font>

117
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,140
around the time of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the implosion of the</font>

118
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,480
tech industry two thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whatever</font>

119
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,229
do you think there's any such effect

120
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now due to the downturn I</font>

121
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,330
don't know if we seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yet Leslie</font>

122
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:34,520
heavy you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> know same thing heavier</font>

123
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,580
now so we're seeing about the same sort

124
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,260
of numbers that we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before maybe</font>

125
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,969
maybe it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a cable industry</font>

126
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,890
where there's a little bit of a runway

127
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,440
yet and we're still working off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

128
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,419
runway and when the runway ends then

129
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,700
maybe it will suit the implosion at that

130
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,660
point but not yet we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not seeing it</font>

131
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:57,050
but what's interesting to me is but

132
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,630
we're kind of a as a society or kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

133
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,240
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> society of quarters and I'm kind of</font>

134
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,860
surprised given that hey we're going to

135
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">be running out of these v-force face</font>

136
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,780
that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want I'm kind of surprised</font>

137
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,280
we're not starting to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole idea</font>

138
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh hey I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna try to</font>

139
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,809
get as much as i can now don't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

140
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might be dampened by the needs</font>

141
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,830
based policies though that's certainly

142
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:24,850
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can certainly try to</font>

143
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:27,620
lie and and they do like what what yeah

144
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we're not seeing too many liars yet</font>

145
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,850
um you can also see basically on V on /

146
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,009
24 it's actually allocated that that's

147
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:40,300
also flatlined

148
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:42,909
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go onto V 6v6 request</font>

149
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,460
it is increasing by some it is a fairly

150
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">small number still but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is going to</font>

151
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,460
be a larger interest in it and the same

152
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,498
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing with view for allocations is that</font>

153
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:57,938
it's growing as well with the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

154
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:59,589
requests<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense so now I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

155
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,349
move on to one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the topics which is a</font>

156
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:06,039
little bit controversial as you all know

157
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:08,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually brought together</font>

158
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,479
about 10 years ago but a lot of the

159
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,889
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was actually allocated</font>

160
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,740
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the errands region were done</font>

161
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:18,069
previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those are defined as</font>

162
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,729
legacy addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things those</font>

163
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:24,370
addresses are really under no sort of

164
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:26,349
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of contract all y'all who received</font>

165
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,589
addresses from and from that point in

166
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:32,289
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that Aaron was incorporated</font>

167
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:35,979
actually had to sign a a registration

168
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:38,740
services agreement and there's this push

169
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:41,080
under way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do a very a</font>

170
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,550
similar sort of agreement for the legacy

171
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:51,188
space holder and as you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

172
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:54,370
legacy space holders are fairly in this

173
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,409
particular slide are fairly consistent

174
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,240
on not really changing their

175
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:01,839
organizational information too much

176
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,149
they're pretty stable most 75% our

177
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Newark's and modifications to those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> orcs</font>

178
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:08,409
and people have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit thrash when</font>

179
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,490
they first come into the system but

180
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,289
those who have been around for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

181
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,080
especially the legacy addresses which

182
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,959
are over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years old by definition</font>

183
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,669
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been just very little change but</font>

184
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,039
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the network</font>

185
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:23,318
modification request that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true and</font>

186
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,248
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically all those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changes made</font>

187
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,289
to your reverse name servers and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

188
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:33,190
more maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in origin is and that</font>

189
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:35,620
sort of thing and that is fairly close

190
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,779
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of break out between legacy</font>

191
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,130
addresses and Aaron manages and the non

192
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:43,838
legacy addresses at mere Aaron manages

193
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,519
so and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

194
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to do is I lewd to a little bit</font>

195
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,649
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're trying to help those</font>

196
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:55,470
have a those who do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any sort of</font>

197
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:59,579
agreement there come into the fold in

198
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:05,870
with this legacy registration services

199
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:08,339
agreement and so far we've had 456

200
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,499
signed agreements actually come in and

201
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,319
what's interesting about this is that

202
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:17,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peaks like in April</font>

203
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:18,719
there's 90 and 71 in October and those

204
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:21,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">are actually correspond to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arents</font>

205
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,920
meetings and so there seems to be sort

206
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,540
of this sort of oh yeah I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

207
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about this when the meetings come</font>

208
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:32,099
forward and and they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and sign</font>

209
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:34,529
these things in<font color="#CCCCCC"> anna de go on you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

210
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,509
see on this graph that these agreements

211
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,980
are a little bit complicated because

212
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,019
usually these things are just kind of

213
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,939
signed off and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're done</font>

214
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,339
with it but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of organizations</font>

215
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:49,699
require some sort of legal review before

216
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:53,069
going forward and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these our</font>

217
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:57,779
errands lawyer and the legacy addresses

218
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:59,069
I lawyers representative actually

219
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,649
getting together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saying okay what</font>

220
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:03,089
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really mean and one of the</font>

221
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that's happened out that does</font>

222
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:08,579
best help a sort of refactor the legacy

223
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,430
RSA agreement and there's going to be a

224
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:13,888
new version coming out here very<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly</font>

225
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,329
if it hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> already that's going to be</font>

226
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,149
addressing some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

227
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:20,550
we've received as we've learned from

228
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">going through this process but the big</font>

229
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,519
take home on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide is you can see</font>

230
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:25,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this thing is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of complicated</font>

231
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,639
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't just a simple thing to do I</font>

232
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:32,550
wish it was simple so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

233
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,800
currently focusing on well I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

234
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,420
air for about a year now and when I came

235
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,339
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron almost everything was based off</font>

236
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,250
at templates mail in your template to

237
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,889
Aaron and a lot of the other registries

238
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,509
have been have gone well beyond that and

239
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:51,059
we're trying to basically join the

240
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:53,790
throne actually do things on via the web

241
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:56,639
and so we're upgrading our services and

242
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,860
as you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've put on secure login</font>

243
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,569
and if you go to aaron's website you'll

244
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,990
see it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upper left-hand side</font>

245
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:04,060
secure login you can go

246
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,270
it and started associating some of the

247
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:10,599
resources that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> with login ID I</font>

248
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,160
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web and we plan on adding more</font>

249
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,630
and more to this so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

250
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,819
actually manage this stuff over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web</font>

251
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,880
instead of doing this over templates I

252
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:22,000
think that'd be a great thing the second

253
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is that we plan on fixing the</font>

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,080
existing I our system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is frankly really</font>

255
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,520
old it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really dusty it sits in it and</font>

256
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,800
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot of traffic so we</font>

257
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,170
don't pay a lot of attention to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

258
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,180
we plan on<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that this year and we</font>

259
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,520
want planted doing some v6 enhancements

260
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:43,810
as well as some stronger incorporation

261
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,189
whether our current database we plan on

262
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at the directory services</font>

263
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,230
problem and i have here who is in our

264
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,630
who is and for you who<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like golden</font>

265
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,209
oldies yeah i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the guys who</font>

266
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,660
helped create our vezz I'm really sorry

267
00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:01,959
that you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with really old code</font>

268
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,910
so we're planning looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at new ways of</font>

269
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,170
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> directory services and making</font>

270
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a little bit more lightweight</font>

271
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,819
than what's currently available today

272
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:12,160
one may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in all four shadow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

273
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,760
bit might be using iris which is IETF

274
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,550
standard which is way that many other

275
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,459
ford registries<font color="#CCCCCC"> ComNet and other systems</font>

276
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,520
are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward looking to use as a</font>

277
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:27,550
way of replacing who is the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

278
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,319
is that we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ricardo kind of</font>

279
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,099
alluded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as well</font>

280
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,329
as we're looking for a way of actually

281
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,250
helping secure the routing

282
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:38,290
infrastructure this means that we're not

283
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,070
forcing crypto on your particular

284
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:44,860
routers but we are actually underway

285
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:48,190
putting a project together having code

286
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,190
in house that's kind of working but not

287
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:54,279
ready for for even pilot time yet for

288
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,320
you guys to start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and i</font>

289
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">know i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about this</font>

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,370
next and this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're I really</font>

291
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,410
like you guys to wake up and this is

292
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,770
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys really have an impact</font>

293
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,569
on what errand future is going to be and

294
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm gonna start out at the top in terms</font>

295
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,570
of what should we be doing with v4 run

296
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,440
out should<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron be allowing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liberalized</font>

297
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,600
transfers

298
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,070
should we allow the idea of a

299
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,320
market-based economy to exist in v4 land

300
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,440
and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what is the interns role</font>

301
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,150
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron have just say okay right I</font>

302
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,130
there's some sort of need here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

303
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,410
that's cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you exchange money I'll</font>

304
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,320
go ahead and make those changes should

305
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,380
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> be increased need to our increased</font>

306
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,240
role should there be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin's role be also</font>

307
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,950
the listing agency<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we have these</font>

308
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,650
guys they have been vetted and have a

309
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,470
true need and here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys who are</font>

310
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,780
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually when we depart were</font>

311
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:54,580
there a horde of IP addresses that they

312
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:57,180
receive like 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago or should</font>

313
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron have just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of ignore all this</font>

314
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,949
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of a raging</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> debate this</font>

315
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,450
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not so clear and we</font>

316
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,850
really like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from you in terms of</font>

317
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,460
how to go forward I have my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal</font>

318
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,390
fears that if Aaron decides to ignore

319
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:14,830
this that it someone else does it may

320
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be authoritah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of any more in terms</font>

321
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,790
of who holds that particular set of IP

322
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,340
addresses because there's been all these

323
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:24,270
redirects going for from the legitimate

324
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:27,790
holder and there were some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of blood</font>

325
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,530
black market activity occurred and so it

326
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:33,130
becomes less authoritative in terms of

327
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:35,079
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> really has that space second of all</font>

328
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,220
what is aaron's role in providing a

329
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,800
basis for a secure routing

330
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,650
infrastructure right now if Erinn goes

331
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,839
poof it dns will be affected after a

332
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit but frankly it doesn't affect</font>

333
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,470
your routing decisions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only time</font>

334
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that really affects your routing</font>

335
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,650
decisions is whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

336
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,150
incorporate this route from someone else

337
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,390
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure it's validated in</font>

338
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:58,060
some fashion there could be the

339
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,890
possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this will tell you a</font>

340
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,599
little bit more closely to Aaron in

341
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,260
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing them following the</font>

342
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,020
validation tree that aaron<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 88 in</font>

343
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,240
some people's view a more important role

344
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,310
and whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you want to be a part</font>

345
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,000
of that role or not is again something

346
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that should be that's been debated um</font>

347
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,360
when you want to take questions on this

348
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,010
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're covering a ton of stuff I</font>

349
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,230
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm voting and I'm trying to go</font>

350
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,630
fast as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only got half an hour okay</font>

351
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,670
go ahead go ahead a okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the first</font>

352
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,270
one about

353
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:32,370
basically transfer policy um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

354
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,250
it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mistake for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron to back out</font>

355
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,140
of the consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> based governance role</font>

356
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,670
that they have now because that's been a

357
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,199
powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for the internet and the</font>

358
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,349
way it's grown and all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

359
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,330
stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know that you'll be</font>

360
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control the market in any way</font>

361
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,560
but you can you know maybe become a you

362
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,610
know title agent or something like that

363
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,380
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you have to think about</font>

364
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a little bit but at the meta level</font>

365
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,360
I think I think it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a very big</font>

366
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">mistake for the registries just to back</font>

367
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,430
out and say you know its market<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you</font>

368
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,460
know number one so I think parents

369
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,839
should really be thinking about

370
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,140
consensus-based rolls it could play in

371
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,640
different kinds of allocation schemes

372
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,370
market being one of them absolutely I

373
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,400
agree um that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first one second one</font>

374
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,960
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll the security thing right</font>

375
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll talk to you about this in</font>

376
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,770
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different context and I've talked to</font>

377
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,740
George and Jeff on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP next side and</font>

378
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:28,140
some people at right the question sort

379
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,030
of could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and asked in a different way</font>

380
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,640
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

381
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,300
you met how big of an operational role

382
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,530
should the rirs f that's correct and

383
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,620
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's a pretty that's a</font>

384
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:43,260
pretty hard question to answer because

385
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,150
to be blunt as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can tell and i</font>

386
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what you said the rirs</font>

387
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:51,000
really do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an operational role</font>

388
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,270
in the internet today in any serious way

389
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,700
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you brew that that's aside from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

390
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,500
reverse if we break<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS all of a sudden</font>

391
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,140
people's mail server start going berserk

392
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,640
but aside from that that's kind of our

393
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,290
biggest role that we play on the

394
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">day-to-day operations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's narrow</font>

395
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,149
it down then you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a the RA</font>

396
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,380
hours do not have an operational role in

397
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,440
the routing system right that's correct

398
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and with technologies like cider in</font>

399
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,980
theory they might right exactly so the

400
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">question I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we ought to be</font>

401
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,750
asking you is if that's true and if

402
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,730
cider or you know these other

403
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,760
technologies that put the rirs in this

404
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:33,150
operational role where is that expertise

405
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,050
going to come from inside from where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

406
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:39,010
inside the rirs is that expertise and

407
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,450
infrastructure really going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

408
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,980
such that you know everybody in this

409
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,290
room says okay that's cool that's a good

410
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,750
idea and have you guys thought about

411
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,220
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the medical</font>

412
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,220
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meta question of whether but</font>

413
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,020
there's also the question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

414
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,450
absolutely absolutely I in some sense

415
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,550
we're kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doers with cider in</font>

416
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,520
that the ITF is that the big thinkers

417
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,010
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff Houston and Steve Kent and all</font>

418
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,660
these guys are putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> together crypto</font>

419
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,520
in terms of making all this stuff happen

420

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has to be</font>

421
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,050
done frankly afterward on on y'all side

422
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,060
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you can actually do</font>

423
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,220
these validations and whether it be in

not been decided yet these are it's a

426
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,510
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good set of questions and that's</font>

427
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,090
why I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> making the call right now is</font>

428
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:27,580
that hey this is a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

429
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Aaron is struggling with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and needs</font>

430
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,760
to have sort of more sort of

431
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,910
community-based input and going for

432
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,140
because frankly it's it's been so

433
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,730
everything has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> debated but it</font>

434
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,530
really needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be have a larger debate</font>

435
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,660
it needs to have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

436
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,610
affected by Aaron actually included in

437
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,290
in that debate and aside from those who

438
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,490
go to the air meetings so Suzanne yeah

439
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,830
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help mark out a little bit</font>

here i hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not getting ahead of you</font>

441
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,129
but as far as the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

442
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:59,500
policy issues let's be very clear on

443
00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:02,380
who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron the policy process is about</font>

444
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,420
everybody who makes shows up and makes a

445
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,580
contribution on the mailing list and in

446
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,100
the meetings it's not just Aaron members

447
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,620
Aaron's staff don't participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

448
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,959
policy discussions that's correct and i

449
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,659
can assure everybody in the room as a

being discussed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cider working</font>

certificate system is relatively mature

but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a lot of discussion</font>

497
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:23,149
about how the secure information would

00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:27,070
actually get employed in making routing

499
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:29,840
decisions this doesn't mean that

certificate work would be being done<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

the router but some representation of

502
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,830
the secure information has to make an

503
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,440
impact on the routing decisions you're

504
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,799
making or there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no point to anything</font>

505
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,869
but we're making<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

routing decisions without a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

information

509
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,169
nation from operators themselves it

510
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:57,730
would be wonderful to have some input

511
00:21:54,169 --> 00:22:01,100
from this Community into that discussion

512
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:04,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay great oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I noticed on the page</font>

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:08,570
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a URL pointed to you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay yep okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great thank you so getting</font>

518
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,979
back to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh yes just one more I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

519
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:30,470
it does seem like a well-crafted

520
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,409
well-thought-out policy could actually

521
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:36,890
play a significant role in slowing down

522
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:38,980
disaggregation right if you know and you

523
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if there was a way that you know</font>

524
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,280
all these somebody's hanging onto their

525
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,720
/ 16 instead of selling it four million

526
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,460
dollars they all decided to break it

527
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,200
into a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 24s and sell it for 10</font>

528
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,000
million dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seemed you know it</font>

529
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,309
seems like there could be you know there

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,960
could policy could not necessarily stop

531
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:56,299
that but at least kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slow that down</font>

532
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,799
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide a you know smooth</font>

533
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,470
out that curve of all that kind of

534
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,879
activity absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's one</font>

535
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that the policy makers</font>

536
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,590
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been looking at in terms of okay if</font>

537
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,439
we allow this what happens it was with

538
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:12,230
the aggregation and so that's definitely

539
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,940
plays a part of the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of to worry</font>

540
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,650
with me sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that they're</font>

541
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,380
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at right but I said well crafted</font>

542
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,940
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought-out right yeah so so it we</font>

543
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:24,500
really encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to be a part of</font>

544
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:28,580
that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can so there's a aaron p pml</font>

546
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:34,970
of these discussions are actually going

547
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:38,210
forward so you okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got two minutes</font>

deployment or the lack of their thereof

550
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,850
one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing is</font>

551
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:49,250
we've done as nanog has and the various

local people

in in these they're in their local

559
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,320
environments and actually say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay look</font>

562
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,539
up and how you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this</font>

563
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,199
home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start playing with it</font>

564
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:22,590
yourselves and helping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> proselytize</font>

565
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,440
world word that way and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been</font>

566
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,240
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> active in all sorts of outreach</font>

570
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:37,889
we have booths and other locations<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

611
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,990
time for everybody to discuss policies

612
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,750
ones that are actually brought to the

613
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,600
table to gauge some sort of interest in

614
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:33,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">those policies and move forward you also</font>

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,909
get a meet with<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of your compatriots</font>

616
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,120
so which you may not have seen in a not

617
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,200
good so it's kind of interesting as

618
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">attachment of a person who's gone to</font>

619
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,090
both meetings for many years there's

620
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:47,459
some crossover but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much as you</font>

621
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,050
would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's definitely a lot</font>

622
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,420
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that go to those meetings that</font>

623
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,620
don't go to these and vice versa so

624
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,220
there's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting to see the</font>

625
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,840
crossover between the two and then you

626
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,540
can learn about how errands policy

627
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,070
process actually works and how open it

628
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,310
is and how you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a part of</font>

629
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:08,159
it and how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron advisory council</font>

630
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:10,409
many of which are here today I have a

631
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:16,590
role in<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping craft those policies as</font>

632
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:19,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">well oops wrong way one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

633
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:22,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we offers a remote participation</font>

634
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,240
via jabber and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a kind of took a</font>

635
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,870
look on the word free here yeah it is

636
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,060
free you don't have to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it so you</font>

637
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,739
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually remotely participate</font>

638
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,480
there's actually real-time transcript

639
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,030
that actually logs on a web page<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

640
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,520
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the jabber session for those</font>

641
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:42,300
people who want to make comments another

642
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,370
one asked questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those who can go</font>

643
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,169
to the mic and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth so</font>

644
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can have remote participation</font>

645
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,480
is actually fairly simple and actually

646
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:55,970
pretty painless and also have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web cast</font>

647
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:58,650
as well gone gone the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong way twice</font>

648
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:02,460
finally for those who don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

649
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:07,950
of funds there's a fellowship program

650
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:11,910
available for a person per sector within

651
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:15,750
Canada Caribbean in u.s. areas and that

652
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,610
deadlines approaching we have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">who has met the qualification and we're</font>

654
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:23,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for a few more Aaron you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

655
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">question I had a comment actually it</font>

656
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:29,100
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to stress the severity of this</font>

657
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,629
that there are

658
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,639
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too meant to be negative</font>

659
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">in any way the people who are making</font>

660
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,450
policy right now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of them</font>

661
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,370
are assignments and allocations people

662
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,530
and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making policy that affects</font>

663
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,570
routing they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making policy that</font>

664
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,010
affects systems are making policy that

665
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,200
affects architecture and business

666
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,120
process and we don't get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it</font>

667
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,340
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be entirely written by</font>

668
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,379
people who are primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

669
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,750
assignments and allocations and that's a

670
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,950
problem we can clearly see things like

671
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:01,650
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know January 1 2009 they started a</font>

672
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:03,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron starts issuing 4-byte asn s by</font>

673
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,820
default I think the numbers were

674
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,549
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a hundred and sixty or so</font>

675
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,899
assigned and maybe two or three were

676
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:12,658
actually used not returned that's

677
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,280
correct it and it's crazy we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

678
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:16,200
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a community it's time to</font>

679
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,570
remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> the separation of operators and</font>

685
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,820
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on Aaron's question it's</font>

686
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,690
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is insufficient overlap</font>

687
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:42,120
in North America of policy and

688
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,740
operations so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is so Aaron</font>

689
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you all should just go to Erin</font>

here we are here we r operators and

691
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,150
engineers and architects and we should

692
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,270
just go to Erin is there some other

693
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:54,059
substantive way that the nanog

694
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:56,340
organizing committees and the nano

695
00:29:54,059 --> 00:30:00,629
community and the air in committee can

696
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:02,668
can facilitate that interaction and now

697
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,110
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just y'all should come to</font>

698
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">our meetings and we should go to your</font>

699
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings because that could happen but</font>

700
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reality is there banare in meetings</font>

for very long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there been a non</font>

702
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,210
meetings for a long time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

703
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:13,890
the overlap that there is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin is a</font>

704
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,120
compelling beautiful man but I don't

705
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that he's actually going to</font>

706
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,789
substantially change the number of

707
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,549
people here who go to those meetings

708
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:22,020
that's very time that's very correct but

709
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:23,340
so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do have the</font>

710
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,440
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that we have these joint</font>

711
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,449
meetings once a year between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and</font>

712
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,510
maybe we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about sort of</font>

713
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,580
ways to opening the two together and in

714
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:38,370
a bigger way now there has been some

715
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,840
some errands errands meeting agenda has

716
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,820
been fairly fixed over the last couple

717
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,490
years you have two days of public policy

718
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,830
meetings and

719
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:48,070
last days at a members meeting where you

720
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">do things like vote on on people who go</font>

721
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:52,178
to the Advisory Council people who vote

722
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,570
who are voted on the board and that's

723
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:57,250
and so on the sofa so forth maybe we

724
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,950
need to think about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font>

725
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,960
do a better job in inclusion of the two

726
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,610
things and making these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

727
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,590
bit so that we have a better cross

728
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,740
colonization because like as I observe

729
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,830
and many you have been there<font color="#E5E5E5"> too there</font>

730
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:14,070
are two distinct sets of people and as

731
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,689
aaron said that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different</font>

732
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:19,030
definitely I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say it ball</font>

733
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,160
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron meetings are a</font>

734
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:25,210
little bit less technically focused than

735
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:27,750
the nanog meetings but they have just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

736
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:32,520
many technical if not more technical

737
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:36,220
implications that come out so so

738
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:38,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything else yeah I guess I'm done</font>

739
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,880
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>
