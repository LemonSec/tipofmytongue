00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,259
thanks Tom hi everybody this this isn't

<font color="#E5E5E5">a talk on a sand 32 in general you've</font>

00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:42,050
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick lightning talk that talks</font>

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:45,530
about an operational issue we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found in</font>

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,890
order of magnitude more information on

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,070
this particular issue on the nanog list

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:55,360
so if this is of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you please</font>

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">go and read that after the talk and the</font>

guys who helped lab up these scenarios

18
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:04,400
that I'm describing so a big thank you

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,908
to these guys who made this tool

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,500
probably more useful I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach</font>

21
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,000
out to you in this room if your

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,369
standards or thur we've got some

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,189
suggestions for you if you write a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

24
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:18,680
stack for an educational or specific

25
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:21,679
enterprise application you need to know

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,270
what's happened as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your bgp</font>

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,590
stack doesn't have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> book and if</font>

28
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,869
you're an operator we need to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,610
you about what you might see if the bgp

30
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:32,180
stat you're running has got the book i'm

31
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,310
describing so I'm guessing that's pretty

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,220
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in the room covered and</font>

33
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,350
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen this before jeff has</font>

34
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,289
demonstrated to this there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

35
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,210
them open to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right curves on the</font>

36
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,220
internet that show good things happening

37
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,869
well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a down into the right curve</font>

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,990
so it must mean something Bad's

39
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:55,550
happening and it's the exhaustion of a s

40
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,979
numbers basically we're what the soon as

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:01,490
we get to 65535 in the standard then

42
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:02,570
there are no more a s is to hand out but

43
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,500
the Internet's still going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

44
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:08,449
grow so we have the problem of well

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,330
sometimes you just can't fit more things

46
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,980
in a space and the same as it's really

47
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,250
difficult to fit two whales in a normal

48
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,890
car you can't fit the number 65536 in

49
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,680
the gap that we have that number today

50
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,540
so what do we do or we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger car</font>

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,330
or we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger space to put the</font>

52
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,629
number in so the standard says to drop a

53
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,569
magic number into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open message where</font>

54
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,679
your Assn number<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be today and we</font>

55
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,779
say that the proper way is and the

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,470
relays and the big one is elsewhere in

57
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:38,770
the packet that

58
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,780
magic number means go and look elsewhere

59
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:44,570
again and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> message needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

60
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,760
updated so in addition to the AAS path

61
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,859
that we know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> love today and use all</font>

62
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,230
the time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> lou prevention and traffic</font>

63
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,180
engineering other uses we drop the same

64
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,609
magic number into the AAS path and that

65
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,540
means go and look elsewhere for the for

66
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,360
the real path of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment support</font>

67
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this software is coming the crucial</font>

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,370

69
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,420
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any ASM 32 customers I'm not</font>

70
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,820
planning to roll a house on to my

71
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,030

virtue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that you've upgraded</font>

74
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,610
so this talk is still important to you

75
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,510
guys who who might see problems on your

76
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,760
networks that I'm about to describe so

77
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,820
this is this is a grab of the screenshot

78
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,600
on the nanog wiki showing which versions

79

80
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,459
for support<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue that I</font>

81
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,340
actually saw on the tenth of December

last year and is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ukraine a large</font>

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,320
right and there was two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

92
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,730
was the one of the up streams that we

93
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,880
saw this through and then there was some

94
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:17,570
networks on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to me but the as4</font>

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:25,159
it which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually illegal according</font>

97
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:26,660
to the 32-bit s and RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we'll look</font>

98
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,610
at why that might have happened shortly

99
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,330
but let's have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

100
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:35,150
impact the RFC is pretty clear if you

101
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:38,810
learn a confederation asn in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

102
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:42,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">message then that's an illegal as4 path</font>

103
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:47,240
the action defined in the RFC is to tear

104
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,099
down that vgp session now we manage

105
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,610
networks for quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few people and</font>

106
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was</font>

107
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,389
an interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> event on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon of</font>

111
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,669
route reflector suddenly found that they

112
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:05,180
were somewhat disconnected from the

113
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:08,150
internet in part or in form and that's

114
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the the sessions with the</font>

115
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,830
transit providers that they had or all

116
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,318
the parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network in the case of</font>

117
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,378
a route reflector were flapping every

118
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,830
time they interpreted this prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

119
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:23,210
was originated by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASM 32 network</font>

120
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,270
this caused a disconnection of those

121
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:29,239
networks from the internet now the

122
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:33,409
reason that when illegal things in the

123
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,779
as4 paths are found and a sessions here

124
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:39,139
down is actually was considered a good

125
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:41,569
idea is basically so that dirty and

126
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:46,189
updates can't leak into the default free

127
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:48,620
to a global<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply because the</font>

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,610
isp would be the one that was shut down

130
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,219
but this didn't happen in this case so

131

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,640
you see the edge full path and just

discard the<font color="#CCCCCC"> update and log that a and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

206
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,540
you learn it via the same neighbor then

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,660
treat it as a withdraw and log as well

208

that the comment that I want you to take

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:31,500
the extension is is inherently bad and

213
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,810
it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad if you went home with</font>

214

the idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish I shouldn't upgrade</font>

215
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,250
I want the message to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be I'm going to</font>

follow this issue and upgrade when it's

217
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,110
safe that's what I want you two to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go in</font>

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember from this talk safety or</font>

219
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,600
come when the standard is fixed that's

220
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,410
what I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see a question</font>

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">already hi RV Friedman I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

222
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,600
that i actually agree that I think that

223
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be better if the update</font>

224
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,020
behavior would be too if we wouldn't be

225
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,240
resetting sessions if we would work

226
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,430
prefixes is invalid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob them and do</font>

227
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,980
other things but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say this is</font>

228
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,530
actually a much older than decade old

229
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,800
issue the first big time I was aware of

230
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:18,750
this was a tan<font color="#CCCCCC"> anak when I think it was</font>

231
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bay routers that ANS used what were</font>

232
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,370
properly someone had read the RFC and

233
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,219
the everyone else routers that everyone

234
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,810
else was using happened and somebody it

235
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,550
was not me at the time I had not yet

236
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,619
written a bgp implementation but someone

237
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:35,040
had done some you know bgp

238
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:39,780
implementation and injected a prefix

239
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,000
with where the packet length the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s</font>

240
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,329
path attribute month went beyond go into

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,180
the packet so Cisco you know so sorry

242
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,670
router you know gets the update and you

243
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,620
know be zeros and then you know when

244
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,770
they get to the a s path attribute they

245
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,860
you know preform the a s path as a bunch

246
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,810
of zeros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they start</font>

247
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,970
and they stop and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go Oh bad</font>

248
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:04,930
they just say oh well the a s path is

249
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:08,320
fubar you know it's you know 56000 and

250
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,989
then you know the bay routers got this

251
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said ain't ate you know RFC bad and</font>

252
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,940
since has always been a problem is there

253
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">are handling RFC what you think what you</font>

254
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,780
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think but I would say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

255
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,700
been some discussion of this even back

256
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,800
ietf and there are there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

257
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,600
feel that we need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

258
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,939
notification mechanism to be the way it

259
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,580
is if I think it's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation</font>

260
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,500
and I think the now audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

261
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,540
important i think the ITF audience may

262
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,700
be even more recording but this is an

263
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,459
old issue that's happened a number of

264
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,320
times that you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> add in BGP vendor</font>

265
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,120
redundancy doesn't necessarily increase

266
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,340
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have those transit</font>

267
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,560
partitions and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot to mention</font>

268
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,990
actually the message was forwarded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

269
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,020
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> posted to the eye dr list today</font>

270
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh no orbit very recently i don't think</font>

271
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,870
it was today but some the message there

272
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,830
was that there's broad support for

273
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,170
roughly what we're proposing because

274
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,400
this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> special case and we really</font>

275
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,339
don't want that works we can partition

276
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">two disconnected from the internet but i</font>

277
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:11,950
did see a thread earlier where the where

278
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,380
it was off it was offered<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the list</font>

279
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,420
that actually bgp actually scales as

280
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,280
well as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does because optional</font>

281
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,160
transitive values that a speaker doesn't

282
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,020
necessarily know are transitive so that

283
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature can grow lab it's at this</font>

284
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,480
part of the transition pattern why bgp

285
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,010
for is as old as it was bit or is and we
