1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so I'm glad not to be following</font>

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the president um so this is about the</font>

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,369
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP monitoring protocol which is</font>

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,439
joint work with a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks and is</font>

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:25,859
currently a draft in the the IETF grow

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:30,390
working group so just to get right down

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,579
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meat what what is this thing and</font>

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,260
and some of you may have seen you know

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,610
previous iterations of this work and I'm

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,559
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little history</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a few</font>

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:43,950
slides but the idea with with BMP is

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,218
that we saw a need for for there to be

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,840
some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a wandering station to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

14
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:55,770
all the routes off of your router not

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,660
just the active paths not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:03,390
initial dump but the initial dump plus

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:06,149
incrementals in real time and to be able

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,090
to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> without screen scraping you</font>

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,320
know the output of a show<font color="#CCCCCC"> route for a</font>

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,790
whole number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons including the</font>

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,979
fact that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pain including the</font>

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,880
fact that it's a resource intensive on

23
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:21,929
the router including the fact is just

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,240
silly and you know what what is this

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,900
useful for well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously and</font>

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,970
clearly looking glasses network analysis

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,880
since we published this thing it seems

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:40,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are using it for more things</font>

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:43,289
as well so again I'll get the history in

30
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,990
a second but but there's some basic

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,960
design goals that have motivated what

32
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:54,089
the draft has morphed into you and that

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,759
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep the keep the design simple to</font>

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,140
make sure that you know while<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping it</font>

35
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,270
simple we're still providing something

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,500
that addresses the need this kind of

37
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,478
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes with the first bullet it needs to</font>

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,800
be easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement and and finally and</font>

39
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,750
I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is important it needs to be</font>

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,750
you know non-service affecting and it's

41
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,760
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a lie when</font>

42
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,410
say something that's sharing cpu with

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,690
your regular routing is completely non

44
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,859
service affecting but but the idea is

45
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,450
that you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the the mongering</font>

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,550
needs to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way when when</font>

47
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:35,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu to do actual routing on</font>

48
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:37,360
your network so some of you with you

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,830
know long memories that extend back you

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,330
know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than six months the way mine</font>

51
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:47,850
seems to will maybe say haven't I seen

52
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:52,570
this movie before and yeah there was a

53
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:56,829
0-0 version of the draft submitted back

54
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:59,530
in way back in 05 which turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

55
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:03,190
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did to be not sufficiently</font>

56
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,500
cooked and by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you know he is</font>

57
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,320
sort of a paper design and sat down said

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,780
okay here's here's some design points

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,000
and there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one critical design point</font>

60
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,709
that turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be wrong and that was</font>

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,720
and I'm kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of jumping ahead here but</font>

62
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that design point was to say okay</font>

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,850
we want to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a bit for a bit</font>

64
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,739
clone of the inbound<font color="#CCCCCC"> update</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stream so</font>

65
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,950
what we tried to do in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is or</font>

66
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:29,980
what I try to do is to to say for every

67
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,470
pier I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clone exactly whatever</font>

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,230
routes that pier sent me whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

69
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,850
know whatever came in on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portland 79</font>

70
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,690
going to send that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the monitoring</font>

71
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:43,090
station with you know complete fidelity

72
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vet turned out to be too ambitious</font>

73
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in the event we sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

74
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and try to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the implementation</font>

75
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,670
you say oh this thing is never going to

76
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:55,000
scale and as a result the whole work

77
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:57,309
just got shelved but it turns out that

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,430
people actually still want to be able to

79
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,019
get the routes off of their router and

80
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,989
we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit of interesting this</font>

81
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,959
and said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine let's let's take it</font>

82
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,579
dust it off keep the high-order bed

83
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,190
meaning keep the the design goal of

84
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:13,720
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the routes off your</font>

85
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,570
router get all the paths not just the

86
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the actives throw out all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

87
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,399
assumptions and start again which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

88
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,638
what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and critically we</font>

89
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,429
actually have an implementation

90
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:31,279
running in the lab so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time we know</font>

91
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:34,099
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trade-offs are correct some</font>

92
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,629
people have asked why you know this

93
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,490
thing once you actually sit down and

94
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:40,219
read through the draft looks a heck of a

95
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot like PGP why aren't you just using</font>

96
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:46,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">vgp for this and there's you know one</font>

97
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,439
very simple answer that is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> Evan</font>

98
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the majority of the people in this</font>

99
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,370
room which is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> p-gp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just gives you</font>

100
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,199
the active paths that's the way bgp

101
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,419
works you know if i send you 10 / aid

102
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,639
and then I send you another update for

103
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:01,669
10 / aid that is an implicit withdraw

104
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,650
the previous one we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

105
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,060
you just the actives we want to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

106
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,650
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past therefore we need something</font>

107
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,969
different there's a thing called ed path

108
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,979
that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were going to have a</font>

109
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:19,819
talk on later<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nanite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but i guess</font>

110
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:23,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">not that that does change things so why</font>

111
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:27,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use that and the answer is yeah the</font>

112
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:32,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipath extension actually probably can do</font>

113
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:34,580
most of what what BMP does and certainly

114
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:36,439
you know at the at the very high level

115
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,779
will give you the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can give you</font>

116
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:43,969
all paths but it's got a number of

117
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:45,860
drawbacks one is or let's let's do this

118
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:49,699
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way and say what does</font>

119
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,229
BMP give you and it's very very it's

120
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:54,529
carefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed in fact to be very</font>

121
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:58,188
<font color="#CCCCCC">very cheap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement in terms of</font>

122
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:59,509
memory it's it's always you always get

123
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:01,639
yourself in trouble and saying this but

124
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:05,839
it's essentially free that the overhead

125
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,129
is like a bit per path you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it or</font>

126
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,990
at least in our implementation we found

127
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:11,149
that we could do it basically

128
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,319
non-invasively the code path that gets

129
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:16,639
executed if you don't turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> on vm p is</font>

130
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,979
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> old code path that it</font>

131
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,539
ever was I with the exception of like

132
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,539
three entry points or something

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,439
it it provides some other little

134
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:32,099
convenience things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about</font>

135
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:37,919
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next few slides I guess that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

136
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:40,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I'm not give you all the details</font>

137
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,099
certainly not packet cartoons and so on

138
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,439
the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there to be ready if you</font>

139
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:47,830
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that level of detail and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

140
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,960
much encourage you to read it but the

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,539
overview<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how do you how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you use</font>

142
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,998
this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what happens is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

143
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,430
router you configure the identity of

144
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:59,229
your management station which simply is

145
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address and port number that</font>

146
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:06,128
that stage is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to listen on and</font>

147
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,779
then optionally an implementation can

148
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,339
let you filter and only monitor a

149
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:14,889
certain set of peers are as currently

150
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:16,089
gives you all routes for all appears and

151
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">then what happens once you've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

152
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,960
configuration is the router will start

153
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:22,748
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to that port on that</font>

154
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,688
management station once it gets a TCP

155
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:28,270
connection it sends you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an initial dump</font>

156
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,889
of routes in a very similar way to what

157
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,839
you would see over a regular BGP

158
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:35,080
connection only<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course you're getting</font>

159
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,659
all the routes for all the piers and the

160
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">way these messages are router sent is</font>

161
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,770
there formatted in regular BGP updates

162
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,969
there then wrapped inside an

163
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,539
encapsulation and the encapsulation

164
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:52,449
actually i'll talk about in the next

165
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:54,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide and then on going once you've got</font>

166
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,229
the initial dump done you get

167
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:58,709
incrementals as here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertising</font>

168
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,520
withdraw routes they get they turn into

169
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,499
advertisements and withdrawals<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

170
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:08,109
propagated again inside the same

171
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:10,180
encapsulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that the</font>

172
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,870
encapsulation is pretty simple it

173
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:17,699
basically tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who the pier is and</font>

174
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:20,379
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route was received so the</font>

175
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,599
identity of the pier means the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

176
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:28,689
address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're actually appearing</font>

177
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:31,438
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP identifier the DRD if that's</font>

178
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:35,700
applicable right discriminator that is

179
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:42,729
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS number of the pier</font>

180
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:44,769
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp is the the time that</font>

181
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,750
the route was installed on my on the

182
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:50,100
router that's being monitored so you

183
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,839
know if I receive 10 / 8 at time T and

184
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,980
then at some future time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally get</font>

185
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,170
around to sing it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the monitoring</font>

186
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,600
station I'll stamp it with time T the

187
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,029
the encapsulation gives you granularity

188
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">up two microseconds are our</font>

189
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:04,750
implementation doesn't give you actually

190
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,160
that that much resolution but it's

191
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:12,190
available if an implementer wants to use

192
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:15,279
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as a sidecar we've also got</font>

193
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:19,420
these statistics reporting messages that

194
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:22,089
are there they're optional to implement

195
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,469
because they're not you know the base

196
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">bread-and-butter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting you the routes</font>

197
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,529
but seemed useful and easy to include so

198
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:31,050
we went ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it and right now</font>

199
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:34,260
there's there's a few counters to find

200
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:37,750
rejected prefixes duplicate prefixes

201
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,769
duplicate withdraws and then cluster and

202
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:44,800
s path loops it's it's extremely easily

203
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:47,290
extensible is just a TLD structure a big

204
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,719
code point space so there's not really

205
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:55,060
any impediment to adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:57,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite counter of your choice you also</font>

207
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,699
get notifications when a peer goes down

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,380
you know again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the picture here</font>

209
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,930
being you've got a router it's being

210
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitored it's peering to you know 20</font>

211
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">different peers and then a monitoring</font>

212
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,320
station getting routes for all those

213
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,760
peers so if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer number six</font>

214
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:18,130
goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the the router puts together a</font>

215
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,010
peer down notification message and says

216
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,899
hey by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure number six went down</font>

217
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,839
and here's the here's a notification

218
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:28,149
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have for it if any I mean</font>

219
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,010
pure<font color="#CCCCCC"> six just closed his tcp connection</font>

220
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">went away then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's not much</font>

221
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,939
notification to be had

222
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:41,479
ok so the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operational</font>

223
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:45,560
characteristics of this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> are as I</font>

224
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,600
alluded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier the BMP updates one</font>

225
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,969
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't assume is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

226
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">their absolute bit for bit clones of the</font>

227
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,360
received updates but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that said</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">instead they're they're regenerated by</font>

229
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:03,260
following virtually the regular bgp

230

update generation code<font color="#E5E5E5"> path the the big</font>

231
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,460
difference being that instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling</font>

232
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:13,820
the data if you remember you know sort

233
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:15,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP conceptual model normally you've</font>

234
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,470
got you know your route<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to the</font>

235
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,770
Hydra bin then they go through policy

236
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,850
they go into your local rib then they go

237
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,980
through some more policy and they go

238
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,510
into an Arab out and then updates get

239
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,890
generated out of that at least that's

240
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:32,540
the block diagram version of it in this

241
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,490
we're kind of short circuiting away the

242
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,500
local rib and the edge without and we

243
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,060
pull the data directly out of the edge

244
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the end what that means is that if</font>

245
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,920
you've applied policies that change the

246
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,100
route for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you strip out</font>

247
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,250
communities or you change the local prep

248
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,530
or whatever that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not get reflected</font>

249
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:56,960
in the the update that gets pushed out

250
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:58,579
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the monitoring station so the idea</font>

251
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,200
being that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know although you</font>

252
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,130
don't get a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent fidelity you</font>

253
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,589
get pretty good fidelity of of what the

254
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,390
received update looked like here's

255
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:10,280
here's my best picture that I'm able to

256
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:15,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">give to you of how I received the update</font>

257
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:19,160
from lapeer second implication of this

258
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,560
is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the updates you know you</font>

259
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have a guarantee that if you</font>

260
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,920
receive you know a million updates for

261
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,960
your peer you're going to generate a

262
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,729
million BMP updates towards your

263
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,190
monitoring station<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if your peer</font>

267

point there's going to be some state

268
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,390
compression and the routers going to say

269
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,430
look you know you're jabbering at me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

270
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to send the final state</font>

271
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:50,390
of that route to the the monitoring

273
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,220
though the characteristic that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

274
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,960
when things<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm down the monitoring</font>

275

station will converge to have you know

276
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:07,670
to know what all the current routes are

277
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:10,730
on the the monitored router in terms of

278

implementations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist this is the</font>

embarrassingly simple that's all the

281
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,479
configuration there is who's the

of other people have talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me about</font>

288
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,980
clients that they're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

289
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:40,250
doing but these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

290
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:45,470
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share on a slide this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

291
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:49,670
fast um ok the we've had after this was

292
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:54,020
presented at the ITF some conversations

293
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:56,870
gone gone on already one request we've

294
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,810
had was to reintroduce of what existed

295
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,120
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier draft called the l bet</font>

296
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,279
which was an indication<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flag to</font>

297
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,839
indicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether a route that's been</font>

298
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,360
sent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the monitoring station is pre or</font>

299
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,640
post policy and by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean remember</font>

300
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">i said a minute ago that we were pulling</font>

301
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,650
all the routes out of the edge ribbon so

302
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:19,910
there was a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the uncooked pre</font>

303
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:23,360
policy routes if your implementation for

304
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,310
whatever reason is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do</font>

305
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,589
basically soft sob reconfig you don't

306
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,140
have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to retrieve those pre</font>

307
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:32,959
policy routes you still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do BMP</font>

308
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,370
you might have to resort to pulling the

309
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,380
routes out of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> local read post</font>

310
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,209
policy and there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> request to say</font>

311
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,490
look please tell me is this route free

312
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:42,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy or post policy seemed reasonable</font>

313
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,339
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hard to add to the</font>

314
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation so we'll probably put</font>

315
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:48,260
that in the 01 draft another request was

316
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:50,209
to say look you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a peer down</font>

317
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,400
indication you don't have a peer up

318
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,619
indication i can guess pretty well by

319
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,680
seeing routes from here that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer</font>

320
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">is up but</font>

321
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,760
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some peers that send me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

322
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,320
routes and then they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be invisible so</font>

323
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,890
please give me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer up indication</font>

324
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,890
again seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasonable shouldn't be hard</font>

325
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:10,949
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement will probably add it to 0 1</font>

326
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:13,830
I hope that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you will take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font>

327
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:18,990
at the at the draft and send any further

328
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:24,149
comments do so just to kind of pull this

329
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:27,120
together some up we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a thing let's</font>

330
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:31,350
let the management station pull routes

331
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,399
off your router get you a phone to full

332
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,990
dump you know the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

333
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">would get out of show route only in a</font>

334
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:40,170
more elegant fashion it looks a whole

335
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,790
lot like bgp use as the bgp code<font color="#E5E5E5"> path to</font>

336
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,949
regenerate the updates towards the

337
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,079
towards the monitoring station and also

338
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide some convenience counters it's</font>

339
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,940
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not suitable for use as a routing</font>

340
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:56,760
protocol for reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't gone into</font>

341
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:58,620
here but I could do offline i guess it

342
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,779
and finally we have an implementation

343
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,959
that's working in the lab and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe</font>

344
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:08,490
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the field sometime this year</font>

345
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,199
and the real reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm standing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

346
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,820
here and talking to you is that that

347
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,320
this is really a prime time for

348
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,810
operators to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this think</font>

349
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,940
about you do I have a need but this me

350
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,439
it's maybe more importantly do I have

351
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,390
need that this almost but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite</font>

352
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,589
meets and if you only gave me this one

353
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,550
little feature that I could I could

354
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:29,640
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you know effective use of it</font>

355
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:33,420
because you know we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still</font>

356
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:36,150
in draft the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the lab but</font>

357
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">not yet in beta so really good time to</font>

358
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,730
try to make changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you know the</font>

359
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,240
sometime later this year I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we'll</font>

360
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,130
try to advance the draft RFC so now

361
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,680
would be a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

362
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,540
think about whether you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs send</font>

363
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,060
feedback either directly to the authors

364
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:59,270
we're on the slide number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or to the</font>

365
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:01,849
row mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

366
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:11,990
thanks very much and got plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

367
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:14,209
for questions I believe hey John did my

368
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,370
er um hey first off I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank you</font>

369
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,390
for doing the fine work we need this you

370
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,560
know I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the route collection</font>

371
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,240
business for a while and the one of the

372
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,760
big problems we've always had is that

373
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,160
the fact i mean i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said the</font>

374
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,450
scope<font color="#CCCCCC"> toms basically you you have a</font>

375
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,770
distributed instrument when you're

376
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,350
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in today's</font>

377
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">world and the sending side of that</font>

378
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,610
instrument has a really heavy filter on

379
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,980
it we call it bgp best path you know and

380
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,929
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrecks that it basically rex the data</font>

381
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,970
you get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the instrument or it puts</font>

382
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,370
a heavy bias on it and so as a result

383
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,140
what we wind up doing is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over</font>

384
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world and trying to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

385
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,450
places in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the and the topology where</font>

386
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:57,350
that filter hasn't yet been applied so

387
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,090
while you're talking about um you know

388
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,560
it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact lassan that you know</font>

389
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,389
and all the local stuff it's actually

390
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to have an impact on the global</font>

391
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,950
routing system because we could change

392
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,350
the way that we do route collection if

393
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,570
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technology which overall in</font>

394
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,090
aggregate will cut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the number of</font>

395
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">collectie throughout collection tcp</font>

396
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,540
sessions or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call that</font>

397
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,500
right it's good news yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if</font>

398
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,990
you think about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit because</font>

399
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,940
basically you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we have</font>

400
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,140
now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the graph theory thing</font>

401
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,610
you know the graph looks different from

402
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,810
where you are in the topology so if you

403
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,030
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good view of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> graph to</font>

404
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:31,700
go all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place right so that</font>

405
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a really big benefit the the</font>

406
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">question I wanted to ask you was um what</font>

407
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,760
kind of state requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know you</font>

408
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,410
said one bit or something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

409
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,390
and I read the draft a couple times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

410
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,980
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't really sure a lot of this might</font>

411
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,360
be implementation dependent but maybe

412
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:50,840
you could talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your implementation</font>

413
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:53,060
what state requirements BMP puts on the

414
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,010
router and where the scaling factors are

415
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,110
like is it in the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of routes and</font>

416
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,010
the number of sessions away you know you

417
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't ask me yeah so basically the</font>

418
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:06,379
there's I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had a smell I do</font>

419
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,879
there's there's one constraint<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put in</font>

420
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,190
our implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that really</font>

421
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,019
helps a lot with

422
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,240
scaling and that is you get one

423
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,889
collector and then if you want to have

424
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,389
multiple guys collecting off the same

425
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:19,879
router and you need to do fan out from

426
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">your from the collector rather than from</font>

427
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:24,049
the router itself that means you only

428
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:27,580
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage state for for the one</font>

429
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:29,570
collector and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you get to</font>

430
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,029
basically the only state you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

431
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,009
know is did I send this this route to

432
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:36,110
the collector yet yes or now which

433
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:39,289
amounts to a bit worth of state / path

434
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,529
does it doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you detectives</font>

435
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:44,899
don't mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

436
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:47,509
enough you only duplicate the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

437
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:48,678
output buffering you have by one time or

438
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:52,070
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is that what you're</font>

439
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:55,580
after there um yeah I mean it's it's

440
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,678
more than that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> because um bgp</font>

441
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,720
implementations don't really do output

442
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,029
buffering very much what they really do

443
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,179
is they do internal bookkeeping in the

444
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:06,769
database to decide whether they have to

445
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:08,299
generate an update or not I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

446
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:10,940
virtual buffering<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose if you like</font>

447
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">what um somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep do the</font>

448
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,610
bookkeeping a silencing yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you</font>

449
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,889
you save a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q structure</font>

450
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,360
stuff that mean for for for a full-on

451
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:22,519
bgp implementation you have to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

452
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,570
separate q / pura peer group you don't

453
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,220
have to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you've already</font>

454
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">got at least our implementation already</font>

455
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,679
has a time ordered queue of updates or a

456
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,689
paths and then you just need the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one bit</font>

457
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,269
to sort of tell you whether you need to

458
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,759
generate an update out of it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

459
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:39,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome hey Dave if you don't</font>

460
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,480
mind not sitting down<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a second Todd</font>

461
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:45,168
Underwood packet fabric so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

462
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:48,440
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> junos not</font>

463
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:51,409
surprisingly and quagga not surprisingly

464
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,809
but not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that relevant and then cisco</font>

465
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:56,809
have you taught is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone at cisco</font>

466
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:59,629
interested in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation yeah</font>

467
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:01,039
my bad cess universe well I was you know

468
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:04,809
but then gave stood up to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font>

469
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I thought I'd um is anyone at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco</font>

470
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,629
love you just be straight about this I

471
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,029
haven't talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anybody about it in</font>

472
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:12,439
cisco but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go push on it that's</font>

473
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:14,659
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can say I mean I don't and you</font>

474
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,580
know it's like yeah there's cisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> J</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

475
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:18,139
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> he knows that right but I haven't</font>

476
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">done anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and nothing's</font>

477
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:22,929
going to happen unless somebody does

478
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you I suppose this is the</font>

479
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:28,060
time to also say you know talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

480
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,310
account team etc etc that would be the

481
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">best form they can help Dave yeah they</font>

482
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,850
can definitely help quick similar

483
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,990
thought along the same lines have you

484
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked to casey you that cater i know</font>

485
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,400
but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very good suggestions</font>

486
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,649
pictures of this would engage people's

487
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,240
attention that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll jump</font>

488
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">simply makes it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll draw our line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

489
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,960
thanks straight down from missed have

490
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,030
you talked about the like loading on the

491
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">route processor if it's going to run on</font>

492
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:01,060
a lower priority compared to bgp itself

493
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:09,250
in our implementation in fact does do

494
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:11,710
some so I mean especially when bgp

495
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,210
session is recovering after it yeah is

496
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,480
your question what the what the behavior

497
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,860
is during during stress on the right

498
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,500
processor yeah if it would have an

499
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,570
impact on update processing yeah so this

500
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where I where I had that bullet that</font>

501
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,590
said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've tried to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

502
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:30,730
intrusive and we tried to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it non</font>

503
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:33,129
service affecting and and the the

504
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,710
approach to that is basically run it at

505
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,350
a lower priority as you say the the

506
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,960
consequence is that during times of you

507
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,240
know hi writing stress<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your</font>

508
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,810
monitoring is going to lag you're

509
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,420
grabbing are you made me some<font color="#CCCCCC"> misfits as</font>

510
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:52,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">well you'll never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D synchronize with the</font>

511
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,610
router but you may see you know message

512
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,110
compression<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a few</font>

513
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,110
slides back thank you

514
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,770
if you if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mountain levy</font>

515
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,050
hurricane electric you talked about only

516
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,120
having configured for one collector

517
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">right for you know this one bit</font>

518
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,159
efficiency does that mean we start

519
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,160
having a fight in the community between

520
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,740
Oregon and caiga and Renesys and anybody

521
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:23,690
else that wants this data um I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

522
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">I did what I it ought to be fairly easy</font>

523
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:31,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take you know whatever beefy cheap pc</font>

524
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:36,020
you want have that be a proxy and then

525
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:39,490
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fan fan out the update stream to</font>

526
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,490
as many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different collectors as you like</font>

527
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:47,240
but you know so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can finish the fight</font>

528
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,270
that way the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason that it's easy</font>

529
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,000
to do that and and it's not not at all

530
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,620
easy to do that with real bgp is that

531
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,230
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> communication is unidirectional</font>

532
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,729
in this case the router just pushes

533
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,960
stuff at the at the collector never

534
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,310
expects to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything back so yeah</font>

535
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:10,940
but you can basically kabul this

536
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:12,770
together with NC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not much more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tom</font>

537
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">daley dynamic network services so on the</font>

538
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,270
collector side in terms of

539
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,800
implementations established a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp socket</font>

540
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:22,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">and start listening and that's all you</font>

541
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,350
need that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> right okay you then</font>

542
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to parse bgp messages</font>

543
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,889
but shares you know a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of open</font>

544
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,820
source code out there to do that sure

545
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,820
thank you you're welcome

546
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,289
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
