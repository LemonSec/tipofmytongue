it's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> problematic in the DFC will</font>

16
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,920
clarify a bit of terminology about

single<font color="#CCCCCC"> hamid pneus and captivity will go</font>

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,719
through a couple of historical recent

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,730
historical deep<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing events big ones</font>

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,320
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at this</font>

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular event this sprint cogent</font>

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,730
appearing on October thirtieth we'll

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,188
look at who was affected who the

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,460
captives were the geographic scope and

25
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,860
and then to round out this concept of

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,139
captivity we're going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

27
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:16,860
captives inside the transit cones of all

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,150
of the members of the DFC so the default

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,390
free zone we all know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the default</font>

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,860
free zone is it's a all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs who who</font>

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,840
do not carry a default route who don't

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,580
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a transit provider the thing that I</font>

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,049
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stress here is that we look at</font>

34
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,340
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a routing perspective strictly</font>

35
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,470
a routing perspective not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business</font>

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,820
perspective we don't distinguish between

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:38,820
paid peering and unpaid peering so and

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,770
then spats between DFC members obviously

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,619
will affect everybody in the transit

40
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,789
cone of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two participants so that's</font>

41
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,130
what we'll look at in a little bit more

42
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,710
detail here is the default free zone as

43
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,408
of the date of the events and continues

44
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,479
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the players all look quite</font>

45
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,210
familiar and you will notice that energy

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,770
sciences network as 293 is in here they

47
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,389
do peer with everybody in the DFC so

48
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,390
that may come as a surprise even though

49
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,520
they're not commercially they don't

50
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:11,280
commercially carrying a truck so deep

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,230
hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deep hearing is is quite</font>

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,260
simple one peer

53
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,810
in a relationship feels that it is not

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,209
reaping a proportional advantage to the

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship and brakes the brakes</font>

56
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,090
appearing link so traffic ratios are

57
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,400
common a common problem when one one

58
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,370
provider is pushing more traffic across

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,019
the peering length on the other so the

60
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,390
aggrieved party is typically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one who</font>

61
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:39,660
is breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the peering link the the</font>

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,670
effects differ significantly depending

63
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,470
on whether you're inside the dfz or

64
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,629
outside the DFC so if you're if you're

65
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,970
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DFC this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is your smaller</font>

66
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,980
provider you're not in that group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 13</font>

67
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,230
we just looked at if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not inside</font>

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,480
that group you you have transit

69
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,390
providers so if there's a deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing</font>

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,608
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and somebody a former</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peer you have</font>

71
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,929
this disappearing deep hearing well your

72
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,400
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to follow your transit</font>

73
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,799
link and and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to its</font>

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,030
destination this this isn't is this may

75
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,359
be a big deal to you and your business

76
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't hurt the internet it</font>

77
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:13,500
doesn't break<font color="#E5E5E5"> the promise of one</font>

78
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,429
internet you pay more for transit and

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,690
and go on with<font color="#CCCCCC"> life inside the DFC it</font>

80
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,209
gets a little bit more problematic

81
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,620
because this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic between the</font>

82
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,319
former<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers doesn't have any place to</font>

83
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,299
go there is no transit link everybody in

84
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,530
this in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> d in the DFC needs to</font>

85
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,310
appear with everybody else in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

86
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,989
this to work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> consequently for anybody</font>

87
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,269
who's captive inside the transit cone of

88
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,500
one of the DFC members the Internet

89
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,410
becomes broken these are the innocent

90
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,430
bystanders they are captives captive

91
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:47,040
customers so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cartoon</font>

92
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DFC using six members we have a</font>

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,940
we have a cliq routing mesh p p5 and p6

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,459
are the ones who are having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deep</font>

95
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,750
earring disagreement right so so one of

96
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,730
them is d<font color="#CCCCCC"> peered the other one and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

97
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,260
that link is broken if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

98
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,590
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deep earring we see that</font>

99
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,168
everybody in p 1 through P<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 everybody</font>

100
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,549
peers with everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what</font>

101
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:13,109
happens when that peering link goes away

102
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:18,180
well p for has no incentive whatsoever

103
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:21,299
to carry traffic from p 5 2 p-6 there's

104
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,760
no financial benefit so what happens to

105
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:27,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">our customers customers underneath the</font>

106
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,909
cones of<font color="#CCCCCC"> p6 and p5 they can't reach each</font>

107
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:38,530
see one cannot talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anybody in p5 s</font>

108
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:40,690
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> let alone p5 itself so single</font>

109
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,969
huh madness this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty clear vinay s</font>

110
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,590
has one transit provider well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

111
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,290
single home that's the case here on the

112
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,020
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left we have seen in the wild</font>

113
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,990
cases like this where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have an</font>

114
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:57,070
AS which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than one provider but</font>

115
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,680
if you keep tracing up toward the DFC

116
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,620
well you'll find that maybe those

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,310
providers have a single a s in common as

118
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,560
a provider so we turn this transitively

119
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,630
single home this case on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left the</font>

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,340
far left excuse me on the far right is

121
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,650
one that we'll see in a few minutes

122
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,479
we'll see an actual example of so this

123
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this is transitively single home we</font>

124
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">would say in this case well we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s 1 is</font>

125
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,190
single home behind as to if ASU is the

126
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:30,479
only provider of<font color="#E5E5E5"> s 1 okay it s 1 is</font>

127
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:34,440
transitively single homes behind as2 if

128
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,790
s<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's providers are either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as2 or</font>

129
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,630
themselves transitively single home

130
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,220
behind as2 so this extends<font color="#E5E5E5"> logically to</font>

131
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,780
prefixes although when we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the term</font>

132
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,570
single home we typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking</font>

133
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:51,280
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SNS so the term captive will</font>

134
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,550
introduce to talk about prefixes

135
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,239
prefixes a prefix is suspected captive

136
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:02,590
to an AS if all observed routes from all

137
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,730
peers have in common now this is this is

138
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,530
particularly relevant if we're talking

139
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,440
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DFC so let's take those 13</font>

140
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:12,359
members in the DFC if if we look at all

141
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,920
routes to giving prefix and in the

142
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,810
rightmost portion of the path we have

143
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same DFC provider we see the same</font>

144
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:23,950
DFC provider for every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> route we</font>

145
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:28,390
can conclude we can guess that this

146
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:33,370
particular prefix is captive to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn</font>

147
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:36,190
is that clear does that make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

148
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,560
so so differentiating a captive from a

149
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,139
suspected captive takes something it

150
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,639
takes an event a DP

151
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,840
ring is really clear when we have a deep

152
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,259
hearing it's really clear you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

153
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,878
and you can see who in if you have a

154
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,499
distributed view you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a large number</font>

155
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,150
of peers whose routes you're collecting

156
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:53,219
you can take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see huh</font>

157
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,520
inside that particular transit cone

158
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:58,498
they're all of the routes to prefixes in

159
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,188
the piers Trent the former piers transit

160
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:03,779
cone they're always drawn that's clear

161
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,120
that that prefix is captive in the in

162
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:09,210
the other providers cone so a deep

163
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,930
earring shows you who actually is

164
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,080
captive alternatively if we look at all

165
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,550
advertisements seen over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look</font>

166
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,800
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> any evidence of backup routes</font>

167
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,949

168
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,659
identify captives or suspected captives

169
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,729
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that actually a</font>

170
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:30,659
little bit later and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at the</font>

171
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:32,490

177
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,210
can provide proof of captivity if if

178
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,938
there is a deep earring here in the DFC

179
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,870
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see any any alternate</font>

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,159

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,229
Thrall comes in will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the convergence</font>

192
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:20,960
but we can see back up rats so we can

193
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">get some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea if a given prefix is</font>

194
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,789
actually captive so and finally this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

195
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually a kind of an</font>

196
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:31,649
interesting thing we we've seen more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

197
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,269
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and that is an asn an outfit</font>

198
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:35,250
wants to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp on the internet and</font>

199
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,870
so they get themselves in a SN and then

200
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,370
they plop in a router in a location over

201
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,229
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they prob pop in a router in a</font>

202
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,789
location over there and it's kind of

203
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,500
like these little islands<font color="#E5E5E5"> right they</font>

204
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,939
they actually have one transit provider

205
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,399
may be in a given location they'll have

206
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,690
to transit providers but they're these

207
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,050
little islands from which<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

208
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,420
advertising these prefixes so so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

209
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,209
archipelago and any

210
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,889
individual prefix advertised from from

211
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,839
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn that has these little islands</font>

212
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:02,000
scattered about any individual prefix

213
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,709
may actually be captive so simply

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,730
because an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn looks like it's</font>

215
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:13,339
multihomed it may not be for a given

216
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:15,620
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a couple of real world</font>

217
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:19,490
examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> pfizer single home behind</font>

218
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:22,339

219
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,440
this one is the example that I mentioned

220
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:27,910
a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier so we have we have</font>

221
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,079
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn 440 844 they have two providers</font>

222
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,250
they have to transit providers they have

223
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:39,859
70 18 and 60 389 68 389 has a soul

224
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:43,459
transit provider 7018 so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a case</font>

225
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:50,060
where this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a transitively single home</font>

226
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:51,560
ASM for 0844 so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

227
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,589
here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

228
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,119
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Islands we've got these these asns</font>

229
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,829
which essentially have these disjoint

230
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,930
locations where they drop in drop in a

231
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:01,880
router and advertise a prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

232
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,680
cognizant<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech is doing this they</font>

233
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,420
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have five different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providers</font>

234
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,209
but in one location they have a prefix

235
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,189
their advertising simply through sprint

236
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:16,899
so this prefix this / this particular /

237
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:20,899
24 is only visible inside Sprint's cone

238
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:24,949
therefore we say this prefix is captive

239
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:26,570
in Sprint's transit cone so not all

240
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:29,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefixes from the say s enter captive</font>

241
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,829
just this one particular prefix so let's

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,630
we actually exclude we exclude the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

identifying how many prefixes geolocate

355

to the US but it's clear that

356
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,469

364
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:05,839
this is always interesting so of course

365
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,149
there were about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourteen hundred and</font>

366
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,970
twenty-six prefixes which were on the

edge prior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deep earring but we're</font>

368
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">not captive so who won those routes 1426</font>

369
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:20,060
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sprint's prefixes and 526 of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cogen's</font>

370
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,449
the way we identify the the winner in

371
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,790
this case is by seeing who who carries

372
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,859
that prefix now or who carried during

373
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:31,279
the deep earring who carried that prefix

374
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the other combatant and a single</font>

375
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,930
prefix can actually be won by multiple

376
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:38,180
providers so what we do is we then take

377
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,638
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the total percentage and we</font>

378
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,430
break it down by the the percentage so

379
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,620
we who won<font color="#CCCCCC"> cogen's prefixes abovenet</font>

380
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:50,870
came in carrying about winning about a

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:56,149
third of of the prefixes level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

384
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:08,209
both came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in about eighteen percent</font>

385
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:09,439
taking about eighteen percent so the

391
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,380
and our further reading would occur

392
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,199
unless the issue was resolved and the

393
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:32,150

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">DSC and how we went through identifying</font>

404
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,110
the number of captives in each transit

406
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,139
how many prefixes relative to the on net

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,090
relative to the downstream cone size so

408
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,930
what we did is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> took over a period of</font>

28 days we took all prefixes seen and we

410

looked at all all AAS paths if a prefix

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,270
these are suspected captives we don't

a backup route but the substantiation of

439
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:43,080
our methodology is that for sprint we

440
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:46,649
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with 6627 suspected captives</font>

441
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very close to 6603 which we</font>

442
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,540
actually measured during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> deep</font>

00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,419

448
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:10,880
is captive so we pay we decided we pick

449
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,639
a little bit on AT&T find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

their find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of examples from</font>

451
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,210
many different categories this sweeps

452
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:25,610
across all all industries I mean all of

453
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:27,350
us know this but affects everybody so in

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">conclusion intelligent multihoming is</font>

455
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:32,389
good we can see the example that I gave

456
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,250
of winn-dixie is not necessarily

457
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,350
intelligent multihoming but how do they

458
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,049
know that they went out and they got to

459
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:41,600
providers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> interestingly they're</font>

00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:44,658
actually captive there transitively

462
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:48,799
provider can guarantee global

463
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,320
connectivity how how can how can one

464
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,830
provider do this can't another provider

465
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:57,139
might pick a fight with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you d peering</font>

466
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:01,299
events can do a lot of damage to

467
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:04,130
captives and the risk is for everybody

468
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,900
so I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to conclude by thanking my</font>

you got your<font color="#E5E5E5"> yoke charged by country</font>

474
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:32,780
yeah did you consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the perfect</font>

specific because I was him I mean I got

477
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:45,500
some feedback from all those South

478
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:49,100
Americans company here yeah and I know

479
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,780
many cases and yet they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> funded</font>

480
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,530
for example if you were spring customer

481
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,210
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the co gian sigh you may not seen one</font>

482
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,799
specific than they<font color="#CCCCCC"> use him because of</font>

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic engineering but they do have a</font>

00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:03,740
bad coupling through a narrow transit

485
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,980
for the less specific perfect uncovers

486
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,890
that more specific ok so we did take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

487
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,539
we did take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

488
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,820
can't actually answer your question very

489
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:18,809
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok ok hi because too</font>

490
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh no we saw many other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs it was not</font>

491
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:23,549
inbound traffic but outbound traffic

492
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,500
yeah so what was happening was and many

493
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:28,408
HP in the region they don't do for

494
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,809
routing yes so they do just default load

495
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:33,659
balance before the outbound traffic this

496
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,490
so that was your neighbor having not not

497
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,220
not something that you can see in the in

498
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,200
the DFC right it looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> goujian and</font>

501
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,000
solve this issue right now and they are

502
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,830
customer obtained and is like hey solve

503
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,779
your problems don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me do for</font>

504
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,799
robbing but they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it this</font>

505

is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good point and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

506
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,168
something that we if if if this is not

507
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,210
shown in<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP we wouldn't necessarily see</font>

508
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:05,370
it it's not showing your view of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

509
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ibgp well this is this is</font>

510
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:10,500
equivalent to somebody default routing

511
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,820
out say cogent for example so they're

512
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,129
never going to advertise out cogent

513
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,289
right but their default routing through

514
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:18,840
coaching so they may they may have a

515
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:21,720
presence on another link we can't see

516
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,970
that so so that is a that is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

517
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,830
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying is these guys are multi</font>

518
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,779
homes to several providers but they

519
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,330
don't accept any other proofs from land

520
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,769
under this default route so in anywhere

521
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,519
in the raw in the internet were there

522
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:37,559
just do balance<font color="#E5E5E5"> defaults so once I with</font>

many of oceans destination customers

532
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,850
sprint even though there was no spring

533
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:05,309
has no around for it because I don't

there no i'm not i'm not paying in yeah

557
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:09,090
you did is there a question and okay so

558
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,220
question is did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

559
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">clustering by a number of a esas not</font>

560
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,850
prefixes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that was that something</font>

561
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">odd no this is actually these suspected</font>

562
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">captives are just prefixed okay so we</font>

563
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,810
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually look we didn't do an</font>

564
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,190
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of AAS level single huh madness</font>

565
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,200
well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the prefixes point of view</font>

566
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,210
was this like twenty-fours you know I

567
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,950
can oh I see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a distribution yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

568
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,510
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single site with the have nots</font>

569
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,370
have not yet done an<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis of</font>

570
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:35,120
distribution that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be a</font>

571
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:37,020
nice thing to add seems like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

572
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,280
interesting to people so maybe that's

573
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,970
something we can do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future it</font>

574
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:45,389
definitely is<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks Thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> You Johnny hi</font>

Margot Joe provo ITA software excellent

576
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,200
presentation I don't want to detract

577
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,810
from it that's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite slide I</font>

578
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,520
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> man but I I kept getting</font>

579
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,850
distracted by your terminology used

580
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:01,110
because dfz<font color="#CCCCCC"> too while I appreciate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

581
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:04,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> avoiding tier 1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay dfz is a</font>

582
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,639
is a is a is an attribute of one's

583
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,190
routing table whether or not one is

584
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,680
carrying or a default not the economic

585
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:15,150
relationships between you and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs</font>

586
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:17,460
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> m so there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of tier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

587
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">and other entities that run without</font>

588
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,080
default up and control their traffic

589
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,990
flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is there another term you yeah</font>

590
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,580
I soba transit free what's wrong with it

591
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:32,580
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay transit free thanks Joe</font>

592
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,050
Patrick hi Patrick Gill<font color="#E5E5E5"> maroc my I was</font>

593
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,780
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you did to</font>

594
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,360
separate people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have say a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

595
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,310
peering any single transit provider

596
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,379
because there were at least there was at

597
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,700
least one example of somebody who's

598
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,100
affected<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the sprint cogent deep</font>

599
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,110
hearing that you didn't list where they

600
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,750
had only one trans provider sprint they

601
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:54,270
have pretty wide peering but they need

602
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,830
spread to get to one or two other tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

603
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">kinds of free DFCS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know whatever</font>

604
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them sure what what's</font>

605
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:04,470
that yes Patrick<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1915 one think like you</font>

606
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,060
didn't know Todd there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

607
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,190
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a broad specific</font>

608
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:13,980
conversation and I was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid</font>

609
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:17,100
calling Randy out but so what did you do

610
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,660
to or what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do to pip find</font>

611
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,090
those in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> since it was missing</font>

612
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,760
here and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering you know if if</font>

613
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,379
you find that is it a to call the flaw

614
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,690
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I get your algorithm</font>

615
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,940
what else could be missing or what else

616
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,420
could be found so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

617
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,730
that say somebody who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in the</font>

618
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,560
transit free click but still peers with

619
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,050
all of the members of the transit

620
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,649
frequent no peers with many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people but</font>

621
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">not all okay so has transit so first is</font>

622
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,480
what you do to find a Transit PATH if

623
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,210
you just see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ASR the prefix in your</font>

624
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,000
peering set from multiple places that

625
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,470
mean that you assign it is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

626
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,210
having transit or having a backup

627
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,100
transit or something are you looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

628
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,600
instance for to transit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Priuses next to</font>

629
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,310
each other to prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has transit</font>

630
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,199
from a guy blow what are you doing very

631
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:08,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">good question what we do is we actually</font>

632
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,680
build we build a model of where we tag

633
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,490
every single edge relationship between

634
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,010
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs and so we use that in order to</font>

635
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,560
and the valley<font color="#CCCCCC"> Valley free property of</font>

00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,940
answering your question<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

638
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,320
slightly I mean how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get is the</font>

639
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,660
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> part here because something</font>

640
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,399
was missing so this is probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

641
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,230
right place to get into something was

642
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,990
missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was you</font>

643
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:36,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">know an obvious gotcha or unknown a bug</font>

644
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,550
in the algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then if we fixed it</font>

645
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,360
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> else we would we see okay thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

646
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:45,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">may come ask you about that thank you</font>

647
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,510
the other questions thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
