something that we could accomplish it

73
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,750
was well worth it and also the support

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,270
the same in other IRS but the great

103
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,380
majority of our members in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> R&D</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking size of prefix but we can</font>

107
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,260
see a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important role from 2006 and</font>

108
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,780
we see

109
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,750
we are super own is very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

110
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,059
see some results in number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of members so</font>

111
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,020

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,840
we are facing<font color="#E5E5E5"> outs before i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start to</font>

116
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,049
facing our it's important to see from

117
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,090
from where we receive some inputs about

118
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:24,230
the challenges about the things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

accomplish to develop the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

126
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:51,859
society and it was very interesting in

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,070
2007 actually before<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 safely deploy</font>

128
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,710
this election<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven which a lot of goals</font>

129
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:00,140
in like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nique without being very active</font>

130
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:04,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">in participating in stablish on these</font>

131
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:10,669
goals could accomplish with 25 actions

132
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:16,840
inside this this set of goals some

133
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:20,120
actions like ICT deployment training

134
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,000
things like this then we start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

135
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,000
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> more participative in this type of</font>

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,110
activity so in to establish this elected

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,870
us in 10 we could directly help them

138
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,860
establish one of the goals is related to

139
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,960
ipv6 deployment of religion is also

140
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,800
addressing some of the expectations we

to the server but also some fees and we

250
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,989
are studying possibilities you to have

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:26,220
other food service operators and we also

253
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:31,680
have some some policies for this the IDS

254
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:35,490
you allow root servers operators you

255
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:40,680
have their assignments ipv6 ipv4 esa to

259
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:54,450
topic division in on these days the main

260
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:58,010
idea is to give information to help

start to playing with ipv6 not playing

263
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,930
but now it's time to start to operate a

264
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,900

267
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,029
idea was you visit some seeds and

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:16,270
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plain format like there's a</font>

440
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:19,090
RFC that<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommends is the usage of this</font>

improved in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community community</font>

445
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,669
coordination side the region we have the

446
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,460
idea to create this lack nog is a

447
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:41,590
network operation group there are some

448
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,260
successful examples inside the region

449
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,639
some in some countries they have some

450
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,620
operators group is very successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

451
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,679
important but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is you create a</font>

452
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,840
space more rational with rational covers

453
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,610
so people can discuss subjects not

454
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,299
amongst ourselves inside their country

455
00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:00,820
but in regional we at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

456
