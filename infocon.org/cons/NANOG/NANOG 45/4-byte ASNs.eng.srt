topic now these days a little bit about

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,730
terminology unfortunately there's quite

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,789
a bit of terminology out there already

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,900
for this new technology so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,180
would just want to let you know that

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going to standardize on using kind</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the air and terminology which i think</font>

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,840
is pretty good we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:44,550
16-bit and 32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs even though other</font>

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">background for this we're presently</font>

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:54,570
running out of 16-bit ASNs from our

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,109

16-bit asn will be will occur june

22
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,270
fourth of 2011 that's a moving time so

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,369
it goes up it goes down but somewhere in

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle of 2011 is where we're</font>

25
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,520
looking so we need to increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,100
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns 16-bit 32-bit lots of 32</font>

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,439
bits I can't imagine peering with a 4

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:22,500
million asn but it could happen so

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,669
32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs will affect everyone even if</font>

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,240
you still have a legacy 16-bit asn so

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,610
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the schedule 2007-2008 you could</font>

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,630
get 32 bday SNS but 16 bits to default

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,700
right now again 32 is the default

34
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,820
presently but most people are still

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,000
opting in for the 16-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs january</font>

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,919
first 2010 no distinction 32-bit only

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,570
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the 16-bit asm's will be</font>

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,420
reserved you can see the table of

allocated 32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs from what we have</font>

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,159
and then what's advertised to date

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so lots of questions for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:12,110
about the policy for changing it so that

43
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,240
they don't default allocate 32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs</font>

44
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,130
and reserve it but as of yet nobody's

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,500
actually submitted a policy change to

46
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,310
have it extended so right now january

47
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,620
first 2010 is pretty much the hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

48
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,020
they always Aaron always<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask if you want</font>

49
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,460
the 32-bit asn most people say once they

00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,620
figure out what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on say no no no</font>

51
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:37,820
no we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the 16-bit ASM so since 2007</font>

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:40,010
169 requests for 32 bits all had seven

53
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,480
of them have changed back to 16-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs</font>

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,660
32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns have been requested all</font>

57
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:57,910
changed back to 16-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs and no new</font>

32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns have been issued this year</font>

59
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,900
so the operational issues if actually

60
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,720
operational issues are huge here if you

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,860

103
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,880
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to briefly talk about the</font>

104
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,620
design goals and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about how</font>

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,120
it works there are a whole bunch of

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,190
other presentations which we have as a

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,110
reference in the back which go into more

108
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,930
detail so we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cover</font>

109
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,900
briefly here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically there's a new</font>

110
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:07,080
RFC 4893 it introduces a new capability

111
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to is called a s4 and there are two new</font>

112
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,698
optional transitive attributes now in

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,130
case you forget about the intricacies of

114
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP attributes optional transitive</font>

115
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,270
basically means if I don't understand it

116
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,039
then I just passed along I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do</font>

117
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,659
anything with it so that's one of the

118
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,090
things that enables compatibility

119
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,830
because this new as4 path would just be

120
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,869
passed along transparently by routers

121
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,039
that don't understand it it was a

122
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,800
compatibility mode which we'll talk

123
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,020
about in the next slide between 32 and

124
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,139
16-bit implementations and then there's

125
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:40,740
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a native</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 32-bit mode between 32-bit</font>

126
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:43,080
peers and the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a gentle</font>

127
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,940
transition and incremental deployment

128
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,969
and the point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to make is</font>

129
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,590
that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several a.d fixes that</font>

130
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,630
have been advertised with 32-bit AS

131
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,849
numbers for quite some time and you

132
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,930
probably don't even notice unless your

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,560
path and also if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's peering</font>

144
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,080
incompatible

145
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,690
mode the 16-bit router will actually

146
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,020
pier with a s number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two three four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

147
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">six so here's a output from router that</font>

148
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,250
actually doesn't understand 32-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

149
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,169
numbers and you can see the the two

150
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,090
three four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> six in the ass path and</font>

151
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,190
then you can also see the optional

152
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,619
transitive attributes which is the as4

153
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,940
path so it doesn't know what that is it

154
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,720
just knows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's an attribute</font>

155
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,090
there that needs to pass along there is

156
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,610
a quick another example to use of the

157
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,380
same prefix the top router doesn't

158
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,930
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the bottom router does</font>

159
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,540
understand 32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s numbers and can</font>

160
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually put the right a s number in the</font>

161
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,479
output here's a little bit about

162
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,659
compatibility and now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my</font>

163
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,849
stunning powerpoint animation okay let

164
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,200
me set the scene for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use obvious</font>

165
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:18,960
numbers so the num BS numbers in 100,000

166
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,740
are 32-bit a s numbers as numbers and

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,810
65,000 our 16-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s numbers running on</font>

168
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,550
routers that only understand 16-bit is

169
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:31,770
numbers so this router starts to

170
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,000
advertise a prefix with an AS path of a

171
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,560
hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that seems</font>

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,870
pretty straightforward talking to

173
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,030
another router that understands 32-bit a

174
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,820
s numbers so they peer natively with a

175
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:47,030
hundred thousand 131,000 as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AAS</font>

176
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:49,500
numbers and then along comes this router

177
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,559
65,000 that actually doesn't understand

178
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,720
32<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bay s numbers so this router is going</font>

179
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,970
to pier with a s 2 3 4 5 6<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of</font>

180
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,180
131,000 in this diagram because he can't

181
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:09,479
actually understand 131,000 as the a s

182
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:11,490
number so because the router a s 131,000

183
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,109
knows that it's running in compatibility

184
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,320
mode it's actually going to put in a

185
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,560
16-bit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s path along with the 32-bit</font>

186
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,050
AAS pal and he's going to translate the

187
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">a s numbers into two three four five six</font>

188
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,289
so you start to see again there's a lot

189
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two three four five six in this</font>

190
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:31,560
diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok appear in between two 16-bit</font>

191
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,990
a s number routers nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

192
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,719
changes 65,000 just puts in

193
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,209
it's a s path at the beginning and sends

194
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,409
it a long way now you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

195
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,539
there's starting to be a difference

196
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 16-bit and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 32-bit a s</font>

197
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:48,020
paths because again an optional trends

198
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,580
transitive attribute router<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say s</font>

199
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,930
65,000 doesn't understand it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

200
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,830
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass along and it can't</font>

201
00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:00,180
understand it and it doesn't modify it

202
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:02,880
again appearing between routers 65 1201

203
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,930
hundred twenty one thousand the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pas is</font>

204
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,110
going to be two three four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

205
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">again because router</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 60 5200 can't</font>

206
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,380
actually understand for 32-bit a s

207
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,079
numbers and it sends the AAS path along

208
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,020
the way and then with the final router

209
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,899
here in a s21 thousand has to do is

210
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,610
reconstruct and merge the EAS path so

211
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,220
that it comes out correctly so you see

212
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,070
he's going to take the 16-bit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s path</font>

213
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,370
and then merge in the two 32-bit numbers

214
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,589
and out comes the correct a s path ok so

215
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,300
again key points to take away here are

216
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,490
that if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers peering in</font>

217
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,990
compatibility mode it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to appear</font>

218
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:45,450
with a s 2 3 4 5 6 so a little bit about

219
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,089
notations there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of notation that</font>

220
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,339
has been proposed the ones that have

221
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">been widely adopted and implemented Ras</font>

222
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,950
plane and a s dot and he has a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

223
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:59,360
examples of how each notation would look

224
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:02,370
RFC 53 96 just came out in December and

225
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,040
that recommends to use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s plane as the</font>

226
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,540
notation I have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> other slides on</font>

227
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,579
notation we'll talk about a little bit

228
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,469
but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be confusing</font>

229
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:12,510
unfortunately for a little bit because a

230
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,790
s plane and a s dot are so widely

231
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,410
implemented and already deployed that

232
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,250
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both for a</font>

233
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,620
while here's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about notation</font>

234
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,300
I apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the denseness and and</font>

235
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,709
the fact that this slide is unreadable

236
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,719
if you're in the back but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

237
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">put all the arguments on the same on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

238
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,050
same slide so as I said RFC 53 96 just

239
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,600
came out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> six weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago it</font>

240
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,719
recommends a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s plane as the notation</font>

241
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,029
operators love it a s plane is also

242
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,630
compatible with existing AAS path

243
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:46,910
regular expressions so if you use

244
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,590
an AS number which<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a dot in it that</font>

245
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,110
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> interferes with KS path</font>

246
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,820
matching so regular expression matching

247
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,700
so you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rewrite all your</font>

248
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,390
regular expressions to escape the dot in

249
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,610
the a s number now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then that's going</font>

250
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a lot of difficulty I run around</font>

251
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">with five policies and I had to rewrite</font>

252
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,210
mine and it took me<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

253
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,680
so i can't imagine an operator running a

254
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,240
router with hundreds or thousands of

255
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,089
policies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to rewrite and</font>

256
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,570
test and validate there's also color a

257
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:21,260
couple other things SNMP has a problem

258
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,790
with a SNS that have dots in them asd be

259
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:27,200
interpreted as a floating<font color="#E5E5E5"> point number</font>

260
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:30,319
in some cases and it just causes many

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,480
operational issues so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was using a</font>

262
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,030
s dot and they've switched to a s plane

263
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,550
now and all the rirs are currently using

264
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,949
a esta but have plans to transition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

265
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,839
plane at some point in the future now

266
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,020
there is a good argument for a s dot is

267
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,030
that it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easier to remember</font>

268
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,620
and the way that the AS numbers have

269
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,569
been allocated you can see it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

270
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,900
clean if you're using a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

271
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:59,990
know that 20 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> apnic and 320 is ripe</font>

272
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:02,390
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on so again you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

273
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,220
start liking this a s number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 3 4 5 6 a</font>

274
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,949
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm starting to get tired of saying</font>

275
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">it the presentation honestly but</font>

276
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically as we said everything your</font>

277
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,240
network is going to have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be upgraded</font>

278
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:17,150
and again since 2 3 4 5 6<font color="#E5E5E5"> is used to</font>

279
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,460
represent every<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32 bit a s number it's</font>

280
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:22,520
impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the real a s number</font>

281
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,500
of the prefix so the implications are

282
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,630
many and and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

283
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,780
operationally very confusing because you

284
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,670
could peer with a s number 2 3 4 5 6

285
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,800
which represent again different 32-bit

286
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,270
guess numbers you could possibly within

287
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,120
multiple times in different locations

288
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:41,270
you're going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 3 4 5 6 everywhere</font>

289
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,720
in the a s path it causes difficulties

290
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,980
with routing policies kind of alluded to

291
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,140
communities is kind of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

292
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,590
discussion issue right now and obviously

293
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't match on a 32-bit a s number</font>

294
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,830
if your router doesn't understand them

295
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,900
meds<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to become interesting</font>

296
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:00,360
think about best path selection between

297
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,130
different a esas meds aren't used unless

298
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,890
you enable it but if you're appearing

299
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,930
with a s 2 3 4 5<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 now all of a sudden</font>

300
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,660
that's the same a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s number even though</font>

301
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,969
it represents different asses so meds

302
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,949
could be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to determine the best path</font>

303
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,110
and then all your flow data is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

304
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:20,580
have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 5 6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you're</font>

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flores flow so here's kind of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

307
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:29,460
of a couple different<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefixes and then</font>

308
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,480
what it would look like on on different

309
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,370
routers to understand and don't

310
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,190
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32 but a s number so you can</font>

311
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:38,070
see this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second prefix for</font>

312
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,660
example 2 3 4 5 6 appears in the first

313
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,520
the ass and<font color="#CCCCCC"> umber in the ass path and</font>

314
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,589
then also in the middle so if you're

315
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,600
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that on a router that doesn't</font>

316
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,770
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32-bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s numbers it kind of</font>

317
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,810
gets confusing because you don't know if

318
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that prefix is being transited or</font>

319
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,550
originated or what by as number two

320
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,040
three four<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then imagine</font>

321
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,709
this kind of scaling up you know right

322
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,050
now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 to 20</font>

323
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,330
prefixes that are being originated from

324
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,310
32-bit a/s numbers but imagine if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

325
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:09,230
starts to get into hundreds or thousands

326
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,229
is going to become pretty unmanageable

327
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:21,540
alright so<font color="#E5E5E5"> software support for 32 bday</font>

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,980
for your vendor and you can see where

334
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:41,850
it's at and what's planned tools for

354
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,150
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be a unique</font>

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,890
experience to look back if somebody

support 32 bday SMS or two to completely

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,819
redo your looking glass at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

360
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,310
time but so for the peering TV people

361
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,810
hopefully sooner than later will be

362
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,810
supporting 32 bit ahead sons

363
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:02,340
no operational issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> removed private AS</font>

364
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,510
command only works on 16-bit s on so you

365
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:10,140
can do with it yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I remember</font>

366
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,720
since the RFC just came out on 32-bit

367
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,370
numbers assignments<font color="#E5E5E5"> and notation right</font>

368
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,710
now you expect removed private a has to

369
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,320
strip off a s numbers but it's actually

370
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,870
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the 32-bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked numbers</font>

371
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,640
which are now private there's an

372
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,930
interesting article as a reference to

373
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">here by the way when you download the</font>

some routing loops and strangeness again

this presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francisco has a really</font>

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,400

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,130
represented by two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six</font>

383
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,740
and as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of talked about</font>

384
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:52,439
unfortunately we have this this mixture

385
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,570
of notation now so while everyone wants

386
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to move to a s plane this so much a s</font>

387

dot out there that we're going to have

388
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,819
to deal with it for a while probably

389
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,250
until everything supports as<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane and</font>

390
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,390
then you know a lot longer because once

391
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,300
something's out there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really</font>

392
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,220
hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get rid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of unfortunately let's</font>

393
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about communities a little bit so</font>

394
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:15,300
RFC 4893 actually refers to this very

395
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:18,390
exciting internet-draft however it's on

396
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,609
a dash to revision and virtually nothing

397
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,770
has implemented it so far someone told

398
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,839
me that quad has supported it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

399
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,209
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked that out now the other</font>

400
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,879
interesting thing is that the format is

401
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,480
a 32-bit integer followed by a 16-bit

402
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,920
integer so you actually can't set the

403
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,780
local administrator field to be your

404
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,090
32-bit ASM because this breaks the

405
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,620
filtering convention that's used at a

406
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,629
lot of internet exchanges around the

407
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,750
world so this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem and</font>

408
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,370
honestly there's there's no really best

409
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,900
common practice or<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommendation on how</font>

410
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,010
to use communities right now because

411
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,210
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of still up in the air</font>

412
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:57,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">and under development so as this draft</font>

413
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,220
matures hopefully you will ask your

414

equal

415
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:06,380
when vendors start implementing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

416
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:07,610
so this slide is interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andy was</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">andy said december 10th</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i noticed it</font>

423
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,500
around Christmas for some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i</font>

424
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,740
was logging into a router but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i saw</font>

425
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,480
three prefixes with a s number<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three</font>

426
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">four five six in them and I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

427
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,880
a minute my router understands 32 Bay it

428
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,139
s numbers so why would it ever see two

429
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,840
three four<font color="#E5E5E5"> five six because it knows how</font>

430
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to translate them right so what's</font>

431
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happening is someone is</font>

432
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:48,350
sticking two three four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> six in the</font>

433
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:50,900
a s<font color="#E5E5E5"> path so I talked to you'll notice 19</font>

434
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,629
151 appears in there and directly

435
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,929
appears with this a s35 320 I talked to

436
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,090
Randy and what he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually seeing on</font>

437
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:01,280
his peering connection already had the

438
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,110
bad the bad a s path in there so there's

439
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,690
there's no real way to know what's going

440
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">on inside a s35 320 and they haven't</font>

sent a mail and they just they just

444
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:15,230
don't answer so until we actually hear

445
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,270
from them on what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside</font>

446
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,270
their ass we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any idea</font>

447
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:29,289
so just test 32-bit compatibility mode

448
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:34,340
or 32-bit native mode we've set up a

449
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:38,690
temporary peering router in packs Palo

450
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,789
Alto to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop hearing so you can</font>

451
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,400
connect to it he<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent us email we'll set</font>

452
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:44,809
it up and you'll see our announcements

453
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,549
and if you want to announce stuff to us

454
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,549
we'll see your announcements you can

455
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:51,860
login to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server just like you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot</font>

456
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:53,960
refuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what the output is coming</font>

457
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,510
back from your your equipment so you

458
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,730
know if your equipment is compatible as

459
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,320
well as working the way that your

460
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,360
equipment vendor says that it should

461
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,090
work sometimes that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always the</font>

462
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,969
case so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will we will appear with you</font>

463
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,269
gladly openly as many routers as you

464
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,459
want as often as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

465
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:14,169
it's there for your use and we've

466
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:16,209
already had some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have have</font>

467
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:20,499
tried it and liked it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully you</font>

468
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:24,369
will like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as well what should you do</font>

469
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:25,929
excellent um you know awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

470
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:28,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one thing and so that's why we're</font>

471
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:29,619
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're hoping that you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

472
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:31,029
awareness that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing to you or</font>

473
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:32,320
that you already have and go talk to

474
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">other operators and let them know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

475
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,279
this is going on no it's what if the

476
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:38,228
impacts going to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network your</font>

477
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,769
equipment your support staff your

478
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:44,229
overall impact of this ask your vendors

479
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:46,749
beat on your vendors to implement 32-bit

480
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:48,729
asn support specifically a s plane and

481
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:51,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors that already have</font>

482
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:54,909
implemented 32-bit asn support buy them

483
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:58,389
a beer develop an upgrade plan test your

484
00:20:54,909 --> 00:21:04,059
stuff get it upgrade and start<font color="#CCCCCC"> running</font>

485
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:06,039
native 32-bit asn<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so a couple</font>

486
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:09,309
conclusions the internet is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

487
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:11,139
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> running and as will your network to</font>

488
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,599
big changes are if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a 16-bit a s</font>

489
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:15,728
number they you should really look into

490
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,918
upgrading real soon now and then

491
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:20,019
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see 32-bit a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s numbers</font>

492
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,609
appear as a s two three four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> six so</font>

493
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:23,289
we were kind of speculating on how many

494
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:25,478
<font color="#CCCCCC">people were logging to their routers</font>

495
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:28,359
right now doing a show IP bgp reg apps

496
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:30,099
two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six so I imagine</font>

497
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:31,718
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a number of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have done that and</font>

498
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:33,668
you're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised at how many</font>

499
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:36,789
prefixes are out there if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

500
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:39,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">an ASM today then you'll probably be</font>

501
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:41,529
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 32-bit ASMR real soon in the</font>

502
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:44,739
future unless you explicitly asked for a

503
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:47,799
16-bit number and you'll need to upgrade

504
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:49,629
as well hear a bunch of resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

505
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,429
apologize these are kind of hard to read

506
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:53,589
but basically a couple of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

507
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to point out is that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

508
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:57,639
interesting rfcs or a lot of interesting

509
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:59,469
presentations that go into more detail

510
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:01,359
as I said Jeff Houston does a lot of

511
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:05,739
very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking on utilization</font>

512
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:07,989
and we've also been working on wiki with

513
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:09,759
much more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> than is in this</font>

514
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:12,129
presentation so I kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to refer</font>

515
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,779
everyone to that one that'll have the

516
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:15,609
latest versions of the software support

517
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,760
as well as links to everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

518
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">can find and</font>

519
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,770
hopefully more of an introduction as

520
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,600
someone hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> not me signs up and</font>

521
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,580
starts to write stuff for it like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

522
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,050
it's wiki so anyone can<font color="#E5E5E5"> login create an</font>

523
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,449
account now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other interesting thing</font>

524
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:31,220
is like man that all this notation is

525
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,520
confusing how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I convert between them</font>

526
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:39,980
well i was using DC and and some you

527
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:41,120
know hex to decimal conversions and

528
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,610
things like that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't do this</font>

529
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,020
kind of stuff in my head<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then turns</font>

530
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:48,290
out there's actually a nice perl module

531
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,580
out there for converting notations so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

532
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,830
would encourage everyone to download

533
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,830
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and then use that parole tool</font>

534
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,310
to convert between 16-bit and 32-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> AS</font>

535
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,080
numbers as you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then lastly</font>

536
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,659
some thanks to everyone that's reviewed

537
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,240
and contributed like we said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

538
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,160
I'm talk to other peers talk to your

539
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,600
friends and equipment vendors and see

540
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,580
what they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and seeing what</font>

541
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,740
they're supporting and also special

542
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,419
thanks to switch and data<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hosting vs</font>

543
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:19,820
for peering router for their

544
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:24,770
contribution event and that's it any

545
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:28,250
questions comments hey Dave over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

546
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,500
hi pick up things on the refuse side<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

547
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,230
iOS doesn't support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the SNS we're</font>

548
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,920
trying you know I'm we're out the user

549
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,750
trying I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why the iOS guys are</font>

550
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,150
dragging their feet on that we've tried

551
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and continue to try hopefully we'll get</font>

552
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it number one number two what do you</font>

553
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,090
guys think about um I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

554
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,190
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here have routers that are</font>

555
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,169
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at 4-byte asn but we were</font>

556
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,940
building a we have this like experiments

557
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,650
list network thing anyway the list

558
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,450
network thing we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> off with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

559
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Scott notation and the implementation we</font>

560
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:05,510
were using and it went a s plane an ass

561
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,399
plane is really tough to deal with you

562

guys you guys have any idea of how we're

565
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,300
going to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that I don't know I</font>

566
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what I'm talking about yeah i mean</font>

567
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,320
like well even<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking about it</font>

568
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">like in my examples like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ASM 131</font>

569
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,370
whatever thousand

570
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,290
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> being the guy that goes the</font>

571
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,959
peering boffin stands up and says my ass

572
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:32,830
numbers you know two million 326

573
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,200
thousands of whatever whatever but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

574
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,580
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i might not racially it's</font>

575
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,710
kind of a nightmare right those yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

576
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,020
sorry but operationally I think a Assad

577
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,090
is more of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nightmare so maybe it's</font>

578
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's not a nightmare with respect</font>

579
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,330
to all the things you listed off you

580
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,280
know it's like well<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot is regular</font>

581
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,230
expression that a character maybe we

582
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,139
should put that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

583
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:57,540
stuff but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand a Scots a</font>

584
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:01,600
light nicer to look at yeah true agreed

585
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:05,830
hey Greg I have a contact at euro trance

586
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,469
telecom is 35 320i happens now they also

587
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,879
have a looking glass so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

588
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,170
find me afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can put you in</font>

589
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,560
touch but it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they're really</font>

590
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">jus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notes and their comforts and there's</font>

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">something strange going on to produce</font>

593
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,250
only response that I can can come up

594
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,800
with whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say well how will</font>

595
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,330
we remember all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers anyone</font>

596
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that watches the simpsons knows there</font>

597
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:36,669
was an episode on this for the area code

598
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,550
splits where they're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

599
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,950
the clip from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone company and they</font>

600
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,500
say well how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i remember all these</font>

601
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,820
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the answer is scientists</font>

602
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,980
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> shown that even monkeys can</font>

remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten numbers you're not stupider</font>

604
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:55,620
than a monkey are you dress

605
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:05,190
just one comment regarding the a s dot

606
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:07,610
if it is more convenient for use were

607
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:11,670
there you some ideas to use some other

608
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:13,889
character as separator that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

609
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">question I haven't followed the</font>

00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,809
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on notation on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea our</font>

611
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,630

612
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:24,899
closely<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure why dot was chosen</font>

613
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,730
as a separator that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one vendor</font>

614
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,500
that uses colon which is kind of equally

615
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:34,170
confusing because<font color="#E5E5E5"> communities colon well</font>

616
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,710
I might have an idea because the old

617
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:40,620
decanate phase 54 protocol use the dot

618
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:45,090
between area and the host ID now maybe

619
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:48,540
someone came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same idea but yeah</font>

620
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:52,379
dr. inconvenient i would say yes playing

621
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:58,129
yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is difficult to see it in a show</font>

622
00:26:52,380 --> 00:27:00,960
IP bgp but on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other hand tools and</font>

623
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,850
regular expressions will break so if we

624
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,400
have to choose between our tools that

625
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,820
are really important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

626
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,040
operationally and let's say look and

627
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,960
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would rather choose for stable</font>

628
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,540
tools then for Lucas Lee a look and feel

629
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,100
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be i can sleep it will be the</font>

630
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,670
optional reading the implementation like

631
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,250
so I DB TT<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dot and then I get an</font>

632
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,570
overview and his dog is that an option

633
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,929
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible there there are a number</font>

634
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:30,330
of vendors out there that support

635
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:32,790
different notations in some cases it's a

636
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,730
configuration command there's actually a

637
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:37,170
patch for quagga that does exactly what

638
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,480
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about where it just</font>

accepts the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS number in any format and</font>

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,340
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want so</font>

641
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:48,000
maybe that's a direction that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

this a couple of people asked me last

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">night what comment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to make</font>

it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike after Andy's presentation</font>

673
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,520
and so I thought I'd choose this

674
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:22,080
opportunity since you mentioned his

675
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,210
presentation he was focused on changes

676
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,020
to the spec that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would permit the one</font>

679
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,310
that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only possible</font>

680
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,860
implementation bug that would produce as

00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:39,950
any ill for madness in that attribute

682
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:42,889
would cause problems so just that one

683
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:45,830
fixes insufficient also any optional

problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know of at least two other</font>

697
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:27,590
just a minor insignificant knit but why

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,360
would anybody care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32-bit privates</font>

how many other the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody</font>
