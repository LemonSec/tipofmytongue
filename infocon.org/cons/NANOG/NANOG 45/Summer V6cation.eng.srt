1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:10,080
all right over the summer of 08 I chose

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,420
to roll out ipv6 on a single state for

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,009
City network it's now become larger

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,109
after an acquisition but we'll figure

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">out how the role extends further when</font>

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,760
the time comes chose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this because</font>

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,439
the figure is easier to campaign for

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,740
everything else related to v6

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,689
deployments if this piece was complete

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,538

dedicated GSR for that category of

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,720
unfortunately had no effective testing

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,330

blow up the router and nothing further

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,920
the second night was the next router

52
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,069
across a link and allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if</font>

was the big unknown because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

networks that already had v6 rolled out

but we're considering it their

82
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,070
competitive advantage and were therefore

83
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,269
not willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about it I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

84
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,640
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what to do and it finally</font>

85

just became pick something think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

86
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,040
it refine it and then do it so for our

router loop backs missing a colon

between the f1<font color="#E5E5E5"> b8 and the pop we used</font>

89
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,019
all of our pops are numbered<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

90
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,470
within each pop the various routers have

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,329
a particular node ID and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

92
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,500
loopback addressing basically has four

fields the 2607 f1<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a two colons and</font>

94
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,238
then a pop number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two node number links</font>

95
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,220
within a pop are addressed as the prefix

Cohen Cohen the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop number</font>

97
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,960
and then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sequential link link ID</font>

98
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,620
that we track internally and then an

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,590
endpoint ID and we use the 112 mask so

100
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,710
it falls on the colon boundary and

101
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,200
therefore there are five fields in use

102
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,729
in those addresses so you can begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

recognize the difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aleut</font>

105
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:47,640
an inter pop link that has six fields

106
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,919
and use referencing the lower numeric

107
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,169
pop number and the higher numeric pop

108
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,080
number and then a sequential link ID

109
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:59,970
running between those pops and then an

110
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,849
endpoint ID with a 112 bit mask so one

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:17,159
router ID numbers on either end of the

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,360
am I not seeing routes and so forth but

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,190
once I slap myself and got standardize

and use 112 for their lan or

127

interconnect link customers getting v6

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,590
would get a / 56 automatically if they

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,450
requested they get a / 48 they wanted

basis in reality no customers with these

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,299
six so there's unfortunately no data

133

there to use our general plan for

assigning those addresses to customers

135
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,240
was to divide and conquer starting off

136
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">with very middle and then kind of doing</font>

147
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:38,070
worked it's worked for us in before

148
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">going it is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is six years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago as</font>

149
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,409
we began<font color="#CCCCCC"> v4 dynamic routing and finally</font>

150
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,990
came into the century we started ospf

151
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:50,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's what we knew at the time three</font>

152
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,600
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago switched to is is a bunch of</font>

153
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,520
reasons one of which we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

154
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:59,400
away from some ospf legacy issues we had

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,979
but and some other benefits however

156
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,620
we've gone back to ospf as part of this

157
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,690
process we had significant deployment

158
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,110
challenges because of multi topology in

159
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,850
is is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> robley could have survived had I</font>

160
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,710
gone through and deployed multi topology

161
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,890
it seems as though you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

162
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,469
multi topo support from day one prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

163
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,849
doing anything with v6 is is and I do

164
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to leave it there</font>

165
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,250
permanently because it's essentially

166
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,030
impossible to do your v4 and v6 commands

167
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:32,640
truly simultaneously when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding</font>

168
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:37,020
a new link or a new router we had major

169
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,159
bomb outs when we tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put v6 if you</font>

170
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,799
didn't have everything lined up

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,770
perfectly so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on ospf once</font>

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,800
again and stayed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> same ibgp hack as</font>

173
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,409
we did and before loop backs and enter

174
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,350
pop links and enter pop links in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

175
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:56,940
everything else upstream and downstream

176
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:59,790
remaining in BGP internal services we

177
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,930
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> none like I said my goal was to get</font>

178
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,670
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and let everything</font>

179
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,030
else kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of begin following from phase</font>

180
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:08,580
1 our internal dns web and mail is

181
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,580
handled by our IT department they are

182
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,800
not ready yet for v6 but at least I'm i

183
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,140
can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm done and the balls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in their</font>

184
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,350
Court we are essentially more of a

185
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,690
wholesale bit mover most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

186
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,700
customers your ISPs of a smaller nature

187
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,280
so our assumption is if they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

188
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,490
need for<font color="#CCCCCC"> webmail or DNS they'll do so</font>

189
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,189
within their own network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

190
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:36,810
survive until were pushed into a need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

191
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:39,360
do so upstream transit dropped an email

192
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,728
at cogent said we'd like v6 what does it

193
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,099
take answer was not yet when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

roadmap for putting it out there

for some money very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> increment but</font>

198
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:02,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just amazingly hadn't heard that song</font>

199
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,680
sung before it came as a bit of a

200
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:07,170
surprise so in the interim we've got a

201
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,969
hurricane electric tunnel we've got some

202
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,579
now some operational experience our

203
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,830
prefixes out there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have no v6</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what to go ping</font>

207
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,360
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can reach them goes back to our</font>

208
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,699
internal services so state of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

209
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,750
so far so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> once we got past our</font>

210
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,600
bombed-out attempts to try with is is

211
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,850
the transition was incredibly smooth

212
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,720
really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> came down to 10pm couple of</font>

213
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:42,000
nights applied some<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands and routers</font>

214
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,940
were happy and stable no<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer demand</font>

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,410
yet but we're still trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

216
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,000
to get this deployed in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

217
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,969
where the customers can actually use it

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,030
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have this full expectation that you</font>

219
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,890
know sales will sell it and we'll all of

220
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,589
a sudden have no ability to deliver it

221
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,449
but to the best of our knowledge the

222
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,750
equipment roadmap is restricted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to v6</font>

223
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:07,620
capable gear so at least going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

224
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:10,200
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better positioned so once we got</font>

225
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,020
going it went well anyone who said there

226
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,460
isn't revenue to be made with v6 hasn't

227
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,100
picked up the phone because<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I got</font>

228
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,950
that call from<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTT saying gladly for a</font>

229
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,870
fee I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmmm maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is some</font>

230
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,790
option for revenue and as an aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

231
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,960
only assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the availability of</font>

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,939
these six on their transit connections

233
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,590
and whatever price difference there

234
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,180
might be is going to influence our

235
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:37,620
decisions going forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> I plopped into</font>

236
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,540
config snippets these are very shortened

237
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,150
just enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show the global and</font>

238
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,780
interface level commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we plopped</font>

239
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:48,510
in see other talks I've given for basis

240
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,810
of metric values and and you can

241
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:55,279
reference the earlier slides to find the

242
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:57,410
addressing formats this is taken from

243
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,249
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> dallas pop which is pop number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

244
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:03,920
and core 2 which is router ID number two

245
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:06,230
and the link shown there goes from pop

246
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,050
to to pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 which is Houston it's the</font>

247
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,550
third link going between those cities

248
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,109
and it's on the Dallas side which is the

249
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:17,359
lower numbered pop so therefore the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

originate our aggregate into our mesh

that it's available<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bgp to propagate</font>

261
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,529
some sort of operational experience for

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of deployment and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not yet</font>

264
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:59,809
able to find some case studies let me

265
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:04,540
know what what kind of questions I can

266
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:04,540
answer and and I'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions now</font>

267
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,010
Oh

<font color="#CCCCCC">Tom Daley dynamic network services so</font>

269
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:25,350
with no internal services for DNS what

270
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,180
are you doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for v6 reverses because I</font>

don't know about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys felt like no</font>

272
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:33,089
reverses in v4 I can kind of deal with

273
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:38,190
it reverses in v6 not having them makes

274
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:41,490
my life really miserable I my goal was

<font color="#CCCCCC">to have this segment of a v6 deployment</font>

infrastructure currently is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not ready to</font>

278

<font color="#CCCCCC">do v6 like the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

279
00:12:52,950 --> 00:13:00,000
motivate that forward is to have an

284
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:17,959
and it's not my power to force it

happy hello I'm Louie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix so um your</font>

287
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:37,269
nameservers can't answer in v6 could you

288
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:42,129
at least put the zone record so it can

289
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:44,800
answer the v4 i'll give that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

290
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:46,930
folks to deal with I my understanding is

291
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,939
we do have a much better or at least in

292
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:55,899
a more opps centric DNS architecture and

293
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:59,279
team post-acquisition so they may be

294
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:01,449
better position to put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

295
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,480
thanks for the presentation it's nice to

296
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:08,829
see various implementations I'm curious

297
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have research to find it there's</font>

298
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,849
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other outreach happening on the</font>

299
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">system side of the world like the Aaron</font>

300
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,829
community nano community ripe etc

301
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,550
pushing to say hey guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's time to</font>

302
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:24,069
started with mini v6 as well and and you

303
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,779
know I got that email from Aaron saying

304
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:27,519
folks you need to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a plan</font>

305
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:32,529
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan that is you need to make</font>

306
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:35,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">it do it do something passed it up to</font>

307
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:41,800
management chain fell on deaf ears I

308
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:43,660
said I need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and the gues</font>

309
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,359
parts losses for Aaron does Aaron have

310
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:51,569
an outreach program that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> focuses on</font>

311
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:54,569
system folks as well lesson maybe

312
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:54,569
somebody

313
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,060
so so that they aren outreach is is

314
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,680
right now it's been actually like I said

315
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">low barriers kind of focus a little bit</font>

316
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,649
on enterprises because they are kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

317
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:13,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">not well served by in their large</font>

318
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,440
contingent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience and and actually</font>

319
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would love to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from you in terms</font>

320
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,940
of where these systems folks are how we

321
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:23,300
can actually reach up I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

322
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,209
be a really neat for Aaron or somebody

323
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to allow for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a repository of things like</font>

324
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:31,579
scripts you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

325
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:34,580
parse rancid configs and generate

326
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,930
reverse zones and comp files just a

327
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,459
place we can put them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go hey here's</font>

328
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,829
what I've done it's really easy DNS

329
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:43,099
isn't that hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's already</font>

330
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:46,279
there sourced internet so it's a

331
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,070
vailable in the community repository air

332
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,470
and put out but as a it was a suggestion

333
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:58,880
that would that we rolled out the end of

334
00:15:51,470 --> 00:16:04,060
the last year fantastic thank you I in

335

Japan some hosting services company or

336

internet access subs company provide

337
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:14,660
ipv6 address automatically even the

338
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:17,390
customer doesn't form<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it so I just</font>

339
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:20,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you have run to do the</font>

340
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:25,970
same thing or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have something in</font>

341
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:28,880
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> are but if you are I mean the</font>

342
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:34,579
reason that you don't do that or this

343
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,709
motor automatic assignment of v6 is part

344
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:40,489
of their service<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that on a road</font>

345
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:42,770
map but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time I did this</font>

346
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:47,240
deployment I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the acquisition</font>

347
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:49,760
was possible and felt that it wasn't in

348
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">my interest especially given the fact</font>

349
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,209
there's limited routers in which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

350
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,829
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer it that it was easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

351
00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:02,239
leave that part of autumn process

352
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:03,500
automation for future and I get the

353
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,849
impression there's now going to be a bit

354
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,160
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure within our provisioning</font>

355
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:16,540
people and from there we can make that

356
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:19,150
automatic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just happy to say I</font>

357
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,780
didn't have to listen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Randy bush</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hi</font>

358
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:25,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jay it's been missing and with the</font>

359
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,750
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these speakers I just</font>

360
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:32,639
it's like it's something's not here oh

361
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,640
ok I think we're good we are running
