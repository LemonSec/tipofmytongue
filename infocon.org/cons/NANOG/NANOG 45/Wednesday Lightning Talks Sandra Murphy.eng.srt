00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,578
a reminder of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the resource pki is</font>

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,669
it certificates which capture the prefix

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,879
allocations so that you can state with

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,800
some Authority who is the holder for any

<font color="#E5E5E5">particular prefix by following the</font>

mature the certificates are have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,439
discussed and we're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready for last</font>

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,970
call on some of those things beyond the

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,570
certificates there's something called

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,420
the route origin authorization the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roa</font>

28
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,110
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing part that's where</font>

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:33,240
the prefix holder gets to say who is the

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,400
authorized<font color="#CCCCCC"> as2 originated a route for</font>

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,369
this particular prefix and it's set up

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,750
so that a prefix holder can authorize

33
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:48,570
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> aass to originate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a route to</font>

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:51,840
its prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now to the issues we</font>

35
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:55,699
got started discussing how this might

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,490
actually get employed in routing

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,610
operations one of the first ideas was a

38
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">row ah sounds a whole lot like a route</font>

39
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,758
object in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> psl there are people who</font>

40
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,090
use our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl round objects to generate</font>

41
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,940
prefix filter lists so there was an idea

42
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,350
to

43
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:20,460
map a database of<font color="#CCCCCC"> roe is to create</font>

44
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:26,049
similar route objects very similar

45
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:29,560
symbols this is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it fits in</font>

46
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,240
with all existing prefix filter

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,150
generation tools because they can

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,080
they'll let you take input from multiple

49
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:40,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> psl route object databases but</font>

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,070
there's an interesting caveat that the

51
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:47,829
route object is attested to by both the

52
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:51,519
prefix holder and the AAS holder the

53
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">rowa is only attested to by the prefix</font>

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,560
holder so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with an</font>

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,970
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff Houston</font>

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,640
was kind enough to point out to

57
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:06,040
everybody suppose you are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP that</font>

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,890
uses route objects to generate prefix

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,250
lists suppose you have a neighbor who

60
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,390
doesn't produce round objects at all

61
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,820
kind of depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do with that</font>

62
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:22,299
there are no route objects<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these</font>

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,130
prefixes information if you generate no

filter<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all that is you accept</font>

65
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,890
anything from that neighbor then there's

66
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:34,360
no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you generate an empty</font>

69
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:44,459
you're blocking all prefixes from that

neighbor then<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else produces a</font>

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,250
you know look at this one if somebody

else produces<font color="#CCCCCC"> aurora their row up</font>

73
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:58,180
becomes the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> input to your route</font>

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,670
filter you generate one a filtered list

75
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,550
that has one entry on it and then you

76
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:07,208
block everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i got those</font>

backwards so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is would this</font>

81
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,130
how well would it work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> would approve</font>

82
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,770
present you with some additional

83
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:26,110
problems the fixed of the particular

84
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:30,789
vulnerability is to take care what you

85
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,860
do if you are generating prefix filters

86
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,460
from databases and one of the databases

87
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,130
are generating from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roma's okay so the</font>

88
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:43,780
second issue is where's the route to

89
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:46,240
this rpki in the prefix allocation

90
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,479
hierarchy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route as I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna iono</font>

91
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,280
issues / aids to the rirs and it goes

92
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,440
down from there no problem we're not

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:02,549
certain that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna will take on the</font>

94
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:05,110
task of producing the route to this rpki

95
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,850
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> says that they won't it's just</font>

96
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,030
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a signed on the</font>

97
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,630
dotted line that they will if they don't

98
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,719
the next logical candidate is for the

99
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,150
rirs but that's multiple to multiple

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,800
routes and you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

101

104
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:34,710

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:39,039
these multiple roots then operators can

106
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:41,739
decide on their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own who's authorized to</font>

107

have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update that every time that the</font>

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,630
which announcements are supposed to have

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,610
rowers so you know to pick up the one

149
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:49,120
that has a row<font color="#CCCCCC"> ax and drop the one that</font>

150
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:51,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't have a row one idea that has</font>

151
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,700
been presented is to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

152
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:59,590
called a bogan origin authorization

153
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:03,310
which says I do not intend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce</font>

154
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:07,270
these prefixes believe no routes for

155
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,250
these prefixes that's the definition but

156
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,080
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the vet the ways that</font>

157
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:17,080
we're talking about validating things

158
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:20,830
with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> boas if a boa exists for a</font>

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,140
prefix and there's a rower for the

160
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,919
prefix something that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes this is</font>

161
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:30,099
ok believe the Roma so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> boa is more</font>

162
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:35,500
like don't believe any routes except

163
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:37,810
those that you do receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> row s for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

164
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,520
other idea that has been discussed is

165
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:43,219
that look at these<font color="#E5E5E5"> rowers as if they</font>

166
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:49,030
were exclusionary kind of like a default

167
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:52,070
deny if there are rows for<font color="#E5E5E5"> around no</font>

168
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:55,760
routes that don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> row as should be</font>

169
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,460
believed but there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with that</font>

170
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,610
that if you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce it</font>

171
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:04,610
at all you're not going to be producing

172
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,980
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roiz for this prefix these might be</font>

173
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,540
prefixes that you've been allocated but

174
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,300
you're not yet announcing or their

175
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,000
prefixes for our internal infrastructure

176
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,740
we had someone talking yesterday about

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,190
attacks on their internal infrastructure

178
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,930
and so they decided just not to announce

179
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that anymore but that doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

180
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,420
somebody else can't announce it so if

181
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,230
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce it at all</font>

182
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:34,099
one possibility is create a<font color="#CCCCCC"> row ax for</font>

183
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:37,760
some fictitious<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS that would never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

184
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,060
accepted something like a s0 and then

185
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,100
because the set is exclusionary no other

186
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,250
routes that didn't have row is

187
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,980
associated with them would be accepted

188
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:51,560
and we're beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss various</font>

189
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,670
ideas of if you had these sorts of

190
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:58,729
things in the rpki system how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

191
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,890
use those in validating routes if you

192
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,140
looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you received</font>

193
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,380
how would you compare a boa to or rowa

194
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,180
les prix specific prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a more</font>

195
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,950
specific prefix all of those things are

196
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">being discussed so there are questions</font>

197
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:18,740
that would be nice for the operators to

198
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:21,020
answer like if the operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> will use</font>

199
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:24,080
under one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenarios was that</font>

200
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,150
you had to sign all you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create</font>

201
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">row is for all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the routes that you</font>

202
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced would that be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem or are</font>

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,040
you likely to do all or none

204
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,170
then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other partial</font>

205
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:44,569
deployment problem of you've decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

206
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,610
do the rpki you've decided to create row

207
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,160
as for all of the routes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

208
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced you allocate a prefix to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

209
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,110
customer they're not ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this</font>

210
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,779
yet but they are multi home so they do

211
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,880
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to produce Ralph announcements on</font>

212
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,649
their own how is somebody out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

213
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,439
world going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand the difference</font>

214
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">between their route announcement and a</font>

215
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:11,060
more specific prefix hijacking against

216
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:14,089
your valid routes so one possibility is

217
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a clueless user you</font>

218
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:20,089
take on the responsibility of producing

219
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">roiz for them or perhaps you create a</font>

220
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">new service that they subscribe to that</font>

221
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:28,779
would have you doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but who knows</font>

222
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">if they would pay money for this feature</font>

223
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:35,000
if you do that are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it</font>

224
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">for your clueless customers clue full</font>

225
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,100
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you going to take on the</font>

226
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,810
responsibility for the grandchildren it

227
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,490
would be nice to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some input from</font>

228
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:49,369
you about how this all happens and

229
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,899
please get involved in the discussion if

230
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,490
there's any way that we can make the

231
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion simpler for you to get</font>

232
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,720
involved in and you don't have to get

233
00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:00,380
involved in the multiple the email

234
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,649
chains the only way to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

235
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,019
the answers to this are helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your</font>

sanity and helpful for your networks is
