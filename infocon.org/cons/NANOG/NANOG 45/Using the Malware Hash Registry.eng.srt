Camry have any of you heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,770
malware hash registry yet raise your

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,050
hand anybody heard of it okay we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

8

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,899
you haven't heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us team camry we're</font>

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,170
the name is covering pronounced comer e

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,390
stands for it's Welsh for Wales we are a

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,800
group of technologists and scientists

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,230
interested in making the internet more

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,610
secure so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the</font>

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,370
elevator ride a little bit up the

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">application or up the OSI model to the</font>

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,629
application layer and we're going to

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,910
talk more at the packet level<font color="#E5E5E5"> or more at</font>

25
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,069
the bits and bytes that are within those

26
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,200
packets rather than the protocol level

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,320
bgp is what we've heard a lot about

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,880
today but our mission is essentially the

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,798
WHO and the why and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is who is</font>

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,658
behind nefarious activity on the

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet why are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they doing these bad</font>

32
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,040
things and how can we keep the internet

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,890
more secure to keep these bad guys away

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,890
so while other others of us are focusing

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,689
on the protocols making them more stable

36
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,640
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> comers here focusing on the people</font>

37
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are using the internet and keeping</font>

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">them away so our agenda first we'll talk</font>

39
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,520
about the purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the malware hash</font>

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,470
registry how to access it how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font>

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,548
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the usages and</font>

42
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,729
applications you cannot you can employ

43
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,439
it with and we'll give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some briefs</font>

44
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:52,289
statistics on what we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms</font>

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">of usage so far and of course looking</font>

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,040
more towards the future and how we see

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:01,020
it possibly being used again just a

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,549
quick recap<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeopardy question who is</font>

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,009
team coming there will be a pop quiz

50
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,810
afterwards so take your pens and papers

51
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,520
out if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of us so began</font>

52
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,700
as a hobby<font color="#E5E5E5"> in back in nineteen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety</font>

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,380
eight and we incorporated in 2004 we

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,839
actually were part of a

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,310
research branch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco and we we sort</font>

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,070
of forked off of that after a short

57
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,930
period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again we're a group</font>

58
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,549
of researchers in are interested in

59
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,800
making the internet more<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure so we</font>

60
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,320
work with many isps a lot of you are

61

<font color="#E5E5E5">us please come and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to me afterwards</font>

64
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'd love to love to partner with more</font>

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,619
and more ISPs worldwide we work with

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,850
over a thousand ISPs certs government

67
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,840
institutions etc possibly you we also

68
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a group of investigators that are</font>

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,120
working for us now we've we've hired

70
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:54,660
Steve santarelli from s Scotland Yard

71
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,150
people from Dutch<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10h TCC polish police</font>

72
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,070
secret service etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a good mix</font>

73
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people to have a law enforcement</font>

74
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,019
background to help us on the

75
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,760
investigative side so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again our mission</font>

76
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,530
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the WHO and the why how does the</font>

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,709
malware hash registry and what is it how

78
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">does that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come into play with what we do</font>

79
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,360
first off this is my view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

80
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet hopefully everyone of you can</font>

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,140
see these slides on the webcast and not

82
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,630
everywhere else it's a piece of Swiss

83
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">cheese now why is that is why is that</font>

84
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,760
significant well the way I look at it is

85
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,709
this and maybe for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> U ipv6 nay nay</font>

86
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,540
sayers maybe this is an ipv4 world right

87
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,770
we have a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swiss cheese well</font>

88
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,000
there's a lot of holes in that cheats

89
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,530
right there's a lot of exploits

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,380
available there's a lot of potential

91
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,850
vulnerabilities as a lot of problems so

92
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,870
these holes are each you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know different</font>

93
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,109
different issues that you may encounter

94
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,580
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet the way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it as</font>

95
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,800
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it still works it's still pretty</font>

96
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,180
flavorful right still I like Swiss

97
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,550
cheese I don't know about you may pick

98
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,730
your favorite flavor but it still works

99
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,010
and you know things aren't things aren't

100
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,310
broken things work great well come

101
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">malware into the mist grant world and</font>

102
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,830
that's piece of Swiss cheese turns a

103
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,420
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more rotten now we we have</font>

104
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">exist to exploits we have these</font>

105
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,799
potential vulnerabilities but along

106
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,560
comes malware along comes a miscreant

107
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,989
and he makes it even worse so the

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,519
problem hasn't the problems gotten

109
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,919
significantly worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point where</font>

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,370
it's not even you know do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even want</font>

111
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,010
to use this anymore this is

112
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,160
this isn't flavorful this isn't useful

113
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,139
to me anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this as I don't know perhaps when</font>

115
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,580
ipv6 comes along we've talked a lot

116
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,600
about about that today right so is this

117
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,150
what the internet is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look like</font>

118
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:46,210
I don't know hopefully not so with with

119
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,909
taking an hour perspective what we've

120
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,560
seen is in terms of number of viruses<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

121
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">hour on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet we've seen our</font>

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,860
sample rates skyrocketing on average<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

123
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,449
see one new virus every two seconds if

124
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,520
you have a calculator out you can you

125
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,289
can punch up in 30 minutes however long

126
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,210
my talk will take how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> new viruses</font>

127
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,789
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> released those that's going to</font>

128
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,440
be your pretty pretty dead-on statistic

129
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:12,070
now guess what that's just what we've

130
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,660
seen we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see everything and I can't</font>

131
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,300
tell you I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how much we're</font>

132
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,220
not seeing but I think we see a fair bit

133
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,289
question is you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real</font>

134
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,930
rate out there it's pretty significant

135
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,099
right what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vectors that</font>

136
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,419
we're talking about course there's

137
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,039
people people releasing them our people

138
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,440
vectors in terms of malware that goes

139
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,930
after your mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices we just saw a</font>

140
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,000
news article come out recently where<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

141
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,599
can actually extract financial details

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">for many phones drive-by downloads lots</font>

143
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:44,830
and lots of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days right</font>

144
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised web servers miscreants are</font>

145
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,659
compromising them installing exploits

146
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,160
and the unsuspecting user goes to a

147
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,220
well-known<font color="#E5E5E5"> web server and lo and behold</font>

148
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,560
if he's vulnerable he's exploited

149
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,630
there's the file in vectors your typical

150
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,150
thumb drives happening more and more

151
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,789
started very early in asia pac and it's

152
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,229
reaching its critical mass in those

153
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:10,210
areas but much more in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. these</font>

154
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:11,860
days as well USB drives etc etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

155
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,430
what's the purpose of the malware hash

156
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:19,210
registry it's just a fancy way of saying

157
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,990
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of incorporating a very</font>

158
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:26,650
simple yet somewhat effective hashing

159
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,150
mechanism to take a signature set of all

160
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,130
the malware that we've seen and make

161
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,770
that available in a usable format to you

162
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,690
so outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your typical antivirus</font>

163
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,580
product all we're simply doing is taking

164
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,440
a signature of each of the files that

165
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've seen</font>

166
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,600
putting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a database and allowing</font>

167
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:45,750
you to query it so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the md5 of the</font>

168
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,490
sha-1 pick your flavor it's all the no

169
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,590
malware that we've seen and of course

170
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the antivirus detection rate that we've</font>

172
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,170
just showing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that it's</font>

173
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,330
shown on our database we're also

174
00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:00,300
presenting you with a synopsis or a

175
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,039
brief snapshot in terms of how bad or

176
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,170
how well detective excuse me that

177
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,000
malware maybe if it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

178
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,910
perhaps it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not well detected at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,970
perhaps you know 3 out of 35 AV vendors

180
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,910
can detect that so we're presenting you

181
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,010
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the this the statistics as to how</font>

182
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,020
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad vendors are detecting it if</font>

you're familiar with our who is server

it's very very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> in concept to</font>

185
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,020
that where you can punch in an IP

address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll return your BGP</font>

189
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,680
so in the same way you can query<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a shot one or md5 hash and</font>

192
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:45,419
it gives you back the results it it's

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:48,630
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do away with AV by any</font>

194
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,880
means in fact you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> say well what</font>

195
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,919
about the polymorphic viruses the ones

196
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,350
that always change their hash or viruses

197
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,030
that you know have have different

198
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,700
runtime characteristics are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you able to</font>

199
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,080
address that no we're not we're not

200
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

201
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,800
compliment a V so this is meant to run

202
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">along side of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is meant to</font>

203
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,669
catch the malware that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> change so</font>

204
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,979
we're maintaining a hash signature set

205
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,349
of about I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a gigabyte</font>

206
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,060
in size so you can quickly determine

207
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,700
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be very effective in</font>

208
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,820
a navy product if you had to synchronize

209
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">a one gig any virus signature file all</font>

210
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's pretty pretty</font>

211
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,650
huge so what we're doing that is storing

212
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,289
that information in the cloud and simply

213
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,819
all you have to do is is issue a DNS

214
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,789
query or who is query and you can get

215
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">the results so again we're trying to let</font>

216
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,049
AV continue to do what it's doing best

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,910
right it can do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavioral analysis</font>

218
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,920
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the polymorphic detection</font>

219
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,800
all that great and fancy stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

220
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,029
everything else things that are

221
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,790
more run-of-the-mill things that we've

222
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:56,279
seen before perhaps we can rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

223
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,730
mhr them our hash registry to give us

<font color="#CCCCCC">this statistics and last but not least</font>

225

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> free for non-commercial use some</font>

226
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,069
of the access methods we talked about

227
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,959
who is but it's also available via a net

228
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,750
cat if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to issue query for</font>

229
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:15,359
multiple hashes at a time hundreds or

230
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,040
thousands even it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem it</font>

231
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,589
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you back the results similar</font>

232
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,420
to who is protocols it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a</font>

233
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:25,110
protocol right you just pipe data to it

234
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,449
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and get some results back so</font>

235
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,450
it's very much similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our bulk who</font>

236
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,790
is also DNS you can issue a single DNS

237
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,190
query and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come back in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a give</font>

238
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,480
you back a txt record with the results

239
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,019
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hash whether or not it's in a</font>

240
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,149
database some other thoughts we've

241
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:45,329
considered are something like an instant

242
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,399
messaging utility where you can just aim

243
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:49,649
or you know pick your favorite instant

244
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,029
message flavor and you can you can

245
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,000
message the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,870
be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much something simple where</font>

252
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,279
we'll talk about it or if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

right on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Left we have our smiley</font>

something they<font color="#CCCCCC"> enter them our database</font>

263
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,109
through various means so we have

264
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,839
collectors across the globe something I

265
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,029
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about yet but we have</font>

266
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,829
well over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 20 different types of</font>

267
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,689
collector so we can collect malware off

268
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:49,040
the wire we go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fetch it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off the</font>

internet known bad places we monitor

270
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,250
botnets we retrieve malware that way and

271
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:58,199
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different mechanisms whereby</font>

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,810
malware can enter our database we also

share malware with in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain number</font>

of circumstances were

where we have certain private exchanges

276
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,710
going so once it enters the database

277
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,560
then what do we do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we run it</font>

278
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,480
through a parallelization process where

279
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,910
it actually analyzes the malware and

280
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,030
cross-references it with 35 antivirus

281
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,410
vendors in a matter of a few seconds and

282
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,449
those results then get tabulated

283
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,819
summarized and anything that comes out

284
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:28,630
the end that does have a positive AV

285

result as infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something then</font>

286
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,880
we stuff that into the mhr so the mhr is

287
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,980
simply comprised of a list of hashes

288
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,660
that we've known to be bad associated

289
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,580

you can just go to come recom and find

it find it there in the service details

in this case we sent a query for that

don't know maybe at the end level we

340
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:49,709
talked a bit about about ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> mat and</font>

00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,170
all that fun stuff well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

342
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,790
like this could happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> right a bro</font>

344
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,130
utilities a lot in the educational world

345
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,109
as you space a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to use</font>

346
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,850
bro I bros a really extensive tool

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:08,160
allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some in-depth packet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis and it works quite well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

might<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that in a bro point at some</font>

350
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,340
point your ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we're open to</font>

351
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,350
suggestions you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement this on</font>

352
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,350
the mail server level where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

353
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,000
files or mail messages coming in and you

354
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,830
extract the files or the attachments

355
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,270
automatically and you can do a cross

356
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,900
query just like you would with them at

357
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,880
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> rbl but it's an rbl for malware</font>

358
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,459
or for attachments rather than for IP

359
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,040
addresses of course you could use this

360
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:38,790
for forensics poor man's AV of course

361
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,160
and you know sky's the limit we'll do a

362
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,569
sneak peek of another tool that we are

363
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,310
planning on releasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually</font>

364
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,730
already been developed just hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

365
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,189
announced it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows version of the</font>

366
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,680
same thing although what we'll do it is

367
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,810
it will list out all the processes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

368
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,120
are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your system and then</font>

369
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,449
query the mhr to see if any of those

370
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,790
processes match the database so think of

371
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,590
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a a V product or something you</font>

372
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,270
might put along with nav product if you

373
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,610
want to know if any of the running files

374
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,460
or processes on your system have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

375
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,290
associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with malware or been filly</font>

376
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,740
with malware in terms of the signature

377
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,740
of the files

378
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:23,550
so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about why we</font>

379
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,319
think this is useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> first off in terms</font>

380
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,699
of well why wouldn't we just use<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IV</font>

381
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,810
product in general and we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

382
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,090
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right we don't have to worry</font>

383
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,770
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem use AV sure maybe</font>

384
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,500
he's great how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you use AV here</font>

385
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,970
on your desktops raise your<font color="#CCCCCC"> hands okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

386
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,440
see a few hands how many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have max</font>

387
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,080
thinks you don't think you don't need AV

388
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,360
I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of max out there all right</font>

389
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,460
you don't need AV that's true there

390
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,440
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are far fewer viruses for the max</font>

391
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,610
and there are four for Windows but we

392
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,020
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how long that'll be the case</font>

393
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,310
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not the fact that</font>

394
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">max</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are better it's just the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

395
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,689
miscreants haven't chosen to go after

396
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,760
max yet because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there aren't as</font>

397
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,890
many out there simple simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font>

398
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,319
game return on investment so if they're

399
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest market</font>

400
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,560
product out there it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably gonna be</font>

401
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,660
windows boxes so we're safe for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

402
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,880
bit but there is still a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of malware</font>

403
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,839
that really that's released for max long

404
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">story short we collect approximately</font>

405
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:18,300
30,000 unique malware samples per day

406
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,340
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> our current AV detective</font>

407
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,079
signatures we see a detection rate of

408
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,000
approximately twenty-eight percent you

409
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,820
said well I use AV I'm safe right and

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,040
wrong you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not safe twenty-eight</font>

411
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,520
percent on average detection<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate across</font>

412
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,040
the board 30 days later probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets as</font>

413
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,730
good as about fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my sig</font>

414
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,339
now not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really right half of half of the</font>

415
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,570
files that we see 30 days later after

416
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:51,210
initial release are detected by AV

417
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:53,310
that's not really good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did a did</font>

418
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,010
receive some results from a private

study when it was first released and an

420
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,200
individual notice that with the using a

422
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,150
rate of approximately fifty percent so

423
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,800
if you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50-percent batting average</font>

424
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,180
plus fifty percent on top of that that's

425
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,730
nearly a hundred percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> right that's</font>

426
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,130
great sure we can't expect to get

427
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,349
hundred percent in all cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

428
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:19,560
certainly it's a lot better than not

429
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:21,899

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,339
open to receiving contributions of

431
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,980
course to the projects such as

432
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,510
additional AV products if you have if

433
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> navy vendor and you'd like</font>

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,740
to participate please<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

435
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,470
I me afterwards we may have your AV

436
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,600
engine covered but we may not if you

437
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,970
want to submit malware samples again

438
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,050
suggestions moral support we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

439
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:48,300
coffee too I love Dominican Republic

440
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:51,899
coffee wink wink nudge nudge in the

441
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,490
first five days we had over 750,000

442
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:58,350
queries<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you an idea of</font>

443
00:17:53,490 --> 00:18:01,020
how how the product was adopted in the

444
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">early days in 2009 we've had well over</font>

445
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:08,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 million queries already just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

446
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:10,020
month of<font color="#E5E5E5"> January a bro add-on was</font>

447
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,210
released the very first day it's

448
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,610
actually that gives you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

449
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,740
automatically extract hashes from files

450
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,889
that are traversing the network I

451
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:24,510
believe it does it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP transaction</font>

452
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:27,270
so from HP gets and automatically checks

453
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:30,300
the mhr to see if any of the hashes

454
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:35,400
match so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah think of it as real-time</font>

455
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:37,680
HTTP monitoring so<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a Linux a tool</font>

456
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,540
that will probe similar to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> winning</font>

457
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">HR I guess you can think of it as Linux</font>

458
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,830
mhr it will probe all the active

459
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,500
processes list them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and then query</font>

460
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,080
the mhr to see if they there's any known

461
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,240
matches some future add-ons we're

462
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,520
considering at this point include a

463
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,280
kernel driver to watch for<font color="#E5E5E5"> new processes</font>

464
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,460
so rather than statically running this

465
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,230
on an irregular basis what it could do

466
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,150
is watch for processes that are released

467
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,370
or that are initiated on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and</font>

468
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,170
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> before allowing it to initiate or</font>

469
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:12,209
or passively allowing it to initiate

470
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:15,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">query</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mhr to see if if it matches also</font>

471
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,970
we're talking about monitoring sub

472
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,970
processes so within processes and

473
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,830
windows you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> DLLs and querying for</font>

474
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,300
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's to see if any of those match</font>

475
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,389
as well so we've seen fair bit of

476
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:32,389
malware using the simple dll techniques

477
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:34,860
for for transferring so just a quick faq

478
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,390
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i interpret the output well it's</font>

479
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually not that bad we talked about it</font>

480
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">right it's really just two numbers</font>

481
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,380
timestamp and detection rate how do you

482
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,889
collect malware

483
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,630
I list is long and<font color="#CCCCCC"> very so there there</font>

484
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,710
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

485
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,480
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect malware although we're</font>

486
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,370
always interested in finding more our

487
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,650
real challenge along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with many other</font>

488
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,560
eight many AV vendors out there we're

489
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,450
not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vendor but is is a similar</font>

490
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,100
one and that there's so much malware out

491
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,200
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> today it's so prevalent that</font>

492
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,600
you really have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick your battles and</font>

493
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,070
yeah it's a it's a scaling issue in

494
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,550
terms of being able to process it all

495
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:15,030
and analyze it on and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue the</font>

496
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,919
appropriate signatures for them so can I

497
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,420
another question can i download your MH

498
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,010
our database well it's not publicly

499
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,810
available but if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to</font>

500
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,490
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in private about some type of data</font>

501
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,149
sharing agreement we're happy to to

502
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,650
discuss details further and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

503
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">this question a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot can I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a sample</font>

504
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:36,420
of this file I need it I need it really

505
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:39,419
bad read the FAQ so which AV engines do

506
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,070
we use at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's undisclosed we</font>

507
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,230
don't list them out because we don't

508
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:47,700
want to make this a miscreant scoreboard

509
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:50,310
or a scorecard to see well if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I if I</font>

510
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,840
write a virus and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I release it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how many</font>

511
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,460
you know how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engines have</font>

512
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">been able to detect my file well there's</font>

513
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,700
websites that can go and upload the

514
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,330
files to if they really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but</font>

515
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,890
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available for</font>

516
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,629
for that type of usage so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

517
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become a scorecard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> therefore the AV</font>

518
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:09,030
engines at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm disclosed if</font>

519
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,530
you want to tell me talk more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about our</font>

520
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,720
malware database or we're happy to

521
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:15,240
discuss later more details how the

522
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,760
architecture works we actually don't do

523
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,560
just maybe scanning that's just the tip

524
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,510
of the iceberg<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're really interested</font>

525
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,340
in you know who's behind them<font color="#E5E5E5"> our and</font>

526
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,980
why are they doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so we do a lot</font>

527
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">more than that we sandbox it we run it</font>

528
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,570
through a internal system to detect you

529
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,220
know what's the malware doing where is

530
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,899
it going on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we</font>

531
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,540
have additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship-building</font>

532
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,430
heuristics<font color="#CCCCCC"> to detect similarities</font>

they relate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one another and in fact</font>

characteristics you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use those as</font>

537
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,490
clue finding techniques to determine you

538
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,710
know if you have sample a zit is linked

539
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,090
to sample B well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> sample B can give</font>

540
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,090
you some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more details as to who's behind</font>

541
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,840
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stop using antivirus certainly</font>

542
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,730
not as if I haven't stress this enough

543
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,620
already please don't stop using a V

544
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,970
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point of the mhr it's</font>

545
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,659
really meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you to be used in</font>

546
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:13,510
conjunction with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool we update</font>

547
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:16,300
the mhr about once a<font color="#CCCCCC"> day so you're not</font>

548
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,310
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get instant updates but they</font>

549
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,680
may be if the file has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> released and</font>

550
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,030
we've scanned it through<font color="#CCCCCC"> our system you</font>

551
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,040
might see it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> early as twenty four</font>

552
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,620
hours from that from one we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

553
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,600
if you have any issues you're using it

554
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,489
you'd like to use it you notice some

555
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,860
false positives so we're more than happy

556
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,930
to take those there's a URL where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

557
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,929
can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your sending your false</font>

00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:43,180
cross-reference the data with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIS T</font>

566
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,730
things like tracking flows we have a lot

of feeds that might be of assistance

571
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,950
questions about your specific network or

572
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,740
eye peas they're in or prefixes giving

573
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,500
it give me holler afterwards we also

574
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,150
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to try to help you</font>

575
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,730
track down who might be behind a given

576
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,470
incident particularly when we can work

577
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:30,730
with law enforcement to make an impact

578
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:33,310
on the problem there's a copy of my

579
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,870
business card it's clear talk to me

580
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:38,879
afterwards if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see one</font>

581
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,879
and that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm ready for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

582
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:53,140
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bastian here you said that average</font>

583
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rates of 80s was twenty-eight</font>

584
00:23:53,140 --> 00:24:00,340
percent yeah an invasion<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue example</font>

585
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,168
you had a hash with 56% 53 yeah so

586
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,480
that's for the individual that's the

587
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:06,100
individual half right exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but</font>

588
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't add anything you of your own</font>

589
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,610
findings you just take the results from

590
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:18,129
the individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> AV engines yep okay</font>

591
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:21,760
thanks sure Wes her dagger Sparta over

592
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,740
here hi looks like great stuff thank you

593
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,679
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> question though you're distributing</font>

594
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,130
your results by who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an DNS is there</font>

595
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:32,010
any plans to sign your DNS set data DNS

596
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,419
SEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I would seem like a good</font>

597
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,408
even if it was an isolated<font color="#E5E5E5"> key that</font>

598
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be one thing that people would</font>

599
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:40,020
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check the data to make sure it</font>

600
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:43,539
was valid that's in the next talk I

601
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:47,350
realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you say it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> segue the</font>

602
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:49,510
cast over appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there we haven't</font>

603
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:53,289
had any specific plans on DNS SEC yet I

604
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:55,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">appreciate the point and in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of in</font>

605
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:57,220
terms of hashes would you is it more of

606
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,659
a concern in terms of getting back

607
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:02,860
positive results for something where

608
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:05,770
theoretically somebody could block a

609
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,408
file if the results been spoofed in

610
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,940
other words yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously the</font>

611
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:11,830
attack case would be somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

612
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,929
distributing a virus in my fingers

613
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,010
probably fairly targeted<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're</font>

614
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,140
trying to aim for one particular

615
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,580
customer and you also want to swap their

616
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,380
dns so that they wouldn't notice they

617
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,539
were affected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a virus it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

618
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's probably more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a corner case than</font>

619
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:26,620
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other cases</font>

620
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:30,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you might hit nonetheless you</font>

621
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:33,219
anytime i'm checking signatures via ssh

622
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,918
fingerprints or you know hashes for

623
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,409
malware that becomes critical data to me

624
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,190
which for me means<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like it protected</font>

625
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:45,059
right so for now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the initial way of</font>

626
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,620
getting around that would be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font>

627
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:49,570
using like a whois query but if you

628
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,399
wanted to stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> to DNS there's a few</font>

629
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">other options such as you could sink the</font>

630
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,480
data down privately and not have the

631
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,130
query over the internet etc etc but yeah

632
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,390
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate the point and definitely</font>

633
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,390
put that in the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to do</font>

634
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,950
any more questions all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>
