00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:10,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there we go so quick overview</font>

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:14,009
thanks Todd quick overview uh in june of

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,130
2008 we had a catastrophic failure at rh

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,070
one data center it resulted in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,830
complete power loss to facility several

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,380
thousand servers were down and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,930
unhappy customers but thankfully nobody

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,849
was injured and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in hindsight</font>

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,198
that's one of the really good thing

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,440
because somebody really could have been

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,610
injured in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we were able to restore</font>

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,410
power within 24 hours despite the total

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,200
destruction of our power switching room

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,750
so it was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of effort to get that</font>

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,489
done and we were able to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the all of</font>

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the infrastructure rebuilt and</font>

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,230
everything back on utility power within

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,789
three weeks so it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,459
monumental effort this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a google</font>

20
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,070
maps kind of overview of our data center

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,820
if you look kind of in the middle there

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,950
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the cluster of generators are</font>

23
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:11,039
the facility has n plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 generator</font>

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,080
redundancy and UPS redundancy but none

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mattered because of the nature of</font>

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,259
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure so what happened well legal</font>

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,960
would have me tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> root cause</font>

28
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,810
is has still yet been determined so

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,439
we're still in a bit of a exploration

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,729
and litigation phase however and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to read this so that I don't miss</font>

32
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,630
state it in case my attorneys are

33
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,920
watching it may have been that the

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,530
incident was caused by an electrical

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,329
short in the conduit carrying the high

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,850
power lines from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the utility provider</font>

37
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,610
into the data center vaporizing the

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">groundwater in the conduit so I don't</font>

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,479
when you run conduit through the ground

41
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,280
you'll typically get some ground water

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,289
in there through seepage over time it'll

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,990
just kind of get in there but what they

44
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,670
what is what may have happened is a

45
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,110
rapid expansion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steam and that's in</font>

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,659
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a data center that we acquired</font>

60
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,268
so it was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those post bubble</font>

61
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,349
acquisitions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were made and some of</font>

62
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,090
the lessons learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk a little</font>

63
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,500
bit about if you if you were one of

64
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,099
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who happen to acquire a</font>

65
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,159
data center like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there may be</font>

66
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:43,418
some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at</font>

67
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,040
but some changes we made we installed

68
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:47,319
circuit breakers at the transformer

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,328
itself to protect the long cable runs in

70
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,530
the data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we do this on all of</font>

71
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,780
our new data centers that we're actually

72
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,370
building ourselves but it's a change

73
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,169
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we made there and we went back in</font>

74
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,689
retrofitted some of our older data

75
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:01,569
centers we've changed some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

76
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:04,299
diagnostic testing of the cabling itself

77
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:07,599
so we do some integrity testing prior to

78
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:09,069
energizing the cable and we also do it

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,719
as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our regular maintenance so we</font>

80
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,909
have to actually disconnect from utility

81
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,739
power and transfer to generators and

82
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:17,489
this has become standard operating

83
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:20,979
procedure in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our data centers now</font>

84
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:23,729
in reconstructing this particular data

85
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:26,530
center we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually ran new conduit</font>

86
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:28,299
applying some best practices around the

87
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,609
spacing and the installation so the

88
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,579
original conduit was actually kind of

89
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:36,129
piled on top of each other in dirt

90
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:38,620
without any concrete poured around it so

91
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:41,228
we actually spaced it to minimum of

92
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">three inches apart now with concrete</font>

93
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:45,370
poured around it and we actually space

94
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,439
the generator and utility conduits

95
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,659
further apart from each other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

96
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,129
reasons the generators didn't help aside

97
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,168
from the power switching equipment being

98
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:55,030
destroyed is that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the conduit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

99
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:58,359
also burned up in the ground as a result

100
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:02,079
of the shorts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that occurred so some of</font>

101
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:03,819
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we learn really need to do a</font>

102
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,560
deeper level of due diligence when

103
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,929
you're purchasing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> prebuilt data center</font>

104
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,239
it's real appealing to buy assets at

105
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,069
pennies on the dollar but you know the

106
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things we kind of take away or you</font>

107
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,439
know the things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know they're</font>

108
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,168
obviously going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to burn you at some</font>

109
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">point and the things you know will burn</font>

110
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,409
you later if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> address them so</font>

111
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,179
the things we knew about we had done a

112
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:22,680
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work to bring these data centers</font>

113
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,479
up to

114
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,060
kind of what we considered our high high

115
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,590
levels of standards but there were some

116
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,490
unknowns that we didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

117
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously got us later some small</font>

118
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,639
improvements in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our infrastructure and</font>

119
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,520
testing processes can prevent these

120
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,139
issues so you know you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

121
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bright guys on your staff but</font>

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking to some external folks from time</font>

123
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,250
to time will give you some different

124
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,360
ideas about how you do your operations

125
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,759
and management of that infrastructure

126
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,820
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't under emphasis on ever</font>

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,800
emphasize this part enough get good

facilities people it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pay for itself</font>

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,449
later my team did an unbelievable job

130
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,430
these guys work 24-7 for three weeks

131
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,620
straight it seemed like sleeping at the

132
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,009
data centers in some cases to make sure

133
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,940
that things were going well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

134
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:20,070
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a business thing if you keep a</font>

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,090
very open channel communications with

with some of the comments we got from

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,099
our customers despite the fact that they

142
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,010
were adversely affected by all this and

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,580
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe a result of steam coming</font>

150
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:56,610
through some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cond of it on the</font>

151
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,130
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the hallway and the power room</font>

152
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">was on the other side of that wall so as</font>

153
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see there was quite a bit of</font>

154
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,349
destruction there on the left side this

155
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">is some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the conduit and some of the</font>

156
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:11,039
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the burns on the condo that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

157
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,299
pulled out of that power room on the

158
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,009
right it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little hard to see but</font>

159
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's actually the door that went from</font>

160
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:18,180
the power switching room into the UPS

161
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,150
room and it's been blown<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the walls</font>

162
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,240
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> been blown off the the building</font>

163
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,008
there that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just on the left the same</font>

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,720
picture of the same wall just a little

165
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,509
bit better view the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

166
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">ceiling there were ceiling tiles</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blowing</font>

167
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:36,040
all over the place

168
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,200
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not surprising actually these are</font>

169
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">some before and after pictures well I</font>

170
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,510
guess they're after and after pictures

171
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,130
really but the the two on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left are</font>

172
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,820
some of the cabling at the transformer

173
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,440
tie and prior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work that was done</font>

174
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to restore it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see on the</font>

175
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,760
right side<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also added some some extra</font>

176
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,039
security around that just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

177
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,400
nobody decides to go up and monkey with

178
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,440
it on the left<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

179
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,419
charring in the power switching gear

180
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,710
after we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff out it's</font>

181
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of hard to make out some of these</font>

182
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,950
images were not mine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then on the</font>

183
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,090
right is the same room after after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

184
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,710
been restored<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the switchgear the</font>

185
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,940
transfer switch again you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font>

186
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:24,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">bowed the bowed cabinets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there from the</font>

187
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,340
from the rapid expansion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steam or air</font>

188
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,750
and then on the right where is the

189
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,460
reconstructed room with the new 80s is

190
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,260
just another picture that hallway you

191
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,880
can see the wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of expand it out</font>

192
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,680
there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a better view than I</font>

193
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,200
had and then on the right was kind of

194
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,640
the post construction work<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this I</font>

195
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,200
don't have I wish I had some better

196
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,060
pictures of the condo but if you look in

197
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper left you can see how the old</font>

198
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,890
conduit<font color="#E5E5E5"> was running some of the breaches</font>

199
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,030
in the conduit as a result of well we

200
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,349
don't know what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was from whether it</font>

201
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,260
was digging it up or whether it was

202
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,150
there prior and then on the right side

203
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,950
that's all the the new spool the wire

204
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was put in the left is how the</font>

205
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,419
condo is spaced in the new installation

206
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,240
and on the right is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think just</font>

207
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:09,070
to picture them pouring concrete and and

208
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,840
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I have if anybody has any</font>

209
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions I will attempt to answer them</font>

210
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:23,370
sorry I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Saturday</font>

211
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,740
afternoon but rumor has it it was it was

212
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,690
there was a there was a technician we do

213
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,250
two hours right the question for remote

214
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,130
viewers sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I yes how loud it was</font>

215
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,690
there was a we do to our site survey

216
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,219
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> a technician walks around the data</font>

217
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,200
center to check for alarms and check

218
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,510
environmental<font color="#CCCCCC"> xand he happened to be</font>

219
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,240
standing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that if the story is</font>

220
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,279
true and so he heard and saw the walls

221
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,060
literally blow out and he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

222
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,339
pretty loud and I blow out you mean

223
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,500
expand right it expanded rapidly yes

224
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,140
just a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Claire but it you know it</font>

225
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't really an explosion / say what it</font>

226
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:02,010
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was quite devastating as you</font>

227
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:03,930
can see any other questions just just

228
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:07,560
quickly thank you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much for the talk</font>

229
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:10,319
very interesting there was a less

230
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,689
physically dramatic but interesting set

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,550
of power failures that were discovered

232
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,380
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to a design flaw that</font>

233
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,180
happened with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of data centers</font>

234
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,510
well they found it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Bay Area last</font>

235
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,430
year is it do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is</font>

236
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,279
there's a set of engineering best

237
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,420
practices that can avoid these sorts of

238
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,950
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> because obviously you had already</font>

239
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,779
put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of money and a lot of</font>

240
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,060
thought to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create the kind of</font>

241
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:36,689
redundancy you thought you needed and in

242
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

243
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,440
flaw they had a completely different

244
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,360
situation but another single flaw well

245
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,339
so I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're a member of the</font>

246
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,839
uptime<font color="#E5E5E5"> Institute and they're kind of</font>

247
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,680
devoted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to developing those best</font>

248
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,360
practices so i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah it as</font>

249
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,910
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any industry those things are being</font>

250
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,410
evolved over time as in every event you

251
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,779
try to walk away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and learn something new</font>

252
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,219
so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're able to bring</font>

253
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,050
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the table there and they</font>

254
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,640
can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out with better practices that</font>

255
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,560
we can all share in the industry

256
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,560
wonderful thank you very much

257
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,219
you
