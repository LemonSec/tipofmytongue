2
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,219
have a very full tutorial so let's get

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,279
started this tutorial is presented by

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,720
two instructors first Kevin<font color="#CCCCCC"> no Berman</font>

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,730
has been in the industry for almost

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,820
three decades and in the peering

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,570
coordinator community for over a decade

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,460
and as for me my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is Bill Norton and</font>

11
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,559
so so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of the internet</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">gray beards you can laugh and applaud</font>

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:46,170
now ha ha<font color="#E5E5E5"> ha Kevin and I have assembled</font>

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,210
some material intended to provide a

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,039
high-level overview of the topic of

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet pairing along with some</font>

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,129
on-the-ground experience that should

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,050
prove illustrious of the fearing

19
00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:03,839
coordinator job this is pairing 101

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:05,820
let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> started but first bill tells</font>

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,240
me I have to introduce him with an

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,360
amusing story this guy sits down at a

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,210
bar and hears a voice say hey I like

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,360
those shoes he turns around but no one

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,509
but the bartender is around he hears the

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,060
voice say I like your shirt he looks

27
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,540
around again but no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is in the</font>

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,960
bar he hears the voice say like your

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,200
haircut too he looks around and still no

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,149
one else is in the bar he calls over the

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,180
bartender and explains what he is

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,689
hearing the bartender smiles and

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:49,710
explains it is the peanuts they're

34
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:54,089
complimentary ha ha<font color="#E5E5E5"> ha Bill let's get</font>

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:59,630
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tried something new maybe</font>

36
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,630
it's in perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you very</font>

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,080
what today Kevin and I have put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,770
a presentation that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really appearing</font>

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,560
101 talk at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk you</font>

40
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,330
will understand specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,880
definitions of transit are what the

42
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,620
definition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet peering is and to</font>

43
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,810
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> extent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the evolutions that</font>

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,490
we've seen endearing ecosystem

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,740
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the tier ones</font>

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,500
tattoos and content providers over the

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,590
last five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so we split this up</font>

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,690
into essentially four sections the first

49
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">section will be introducing to you the</font>

50
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,420
definitions used in the trade for

51
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,980
internet transit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet peering</font>

52
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,500
then we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go on and apply</font>

53
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,160
those definitions and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> will in fact</font>

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,170
be a quiz to begin test the definitions

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,450
in your mind one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

56
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,730
found in delivering this material over

57
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,399
the years is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to sit there</font>

58
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">and listen and maybe pick up some of the</font>

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,180
stuff but until you actually are asked

60
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,549
questions and have to process in your

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,519
mind and then regurgitate and answer

62
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:08,730
back does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually get firmly into</font>

63
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,310
your mind then Kevin will take over and

64
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,920
talk a little bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

65
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,170
non-financial the more really down on

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,420
the ground type of experience level

67
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,130
expertise that he's accumulated over the

68
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">past couple of decades doing this stuff</font>

69
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,440
and if we have time is anyone here

70
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,070
interested in talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about internet</font>

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,720
exchange points<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> folks why</font>

72
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,600
I could talk to internet exchange points

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,459
for hours and if there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we could</font>

74
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,190
do that here if there's not time then

75
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,480
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> circle up somewhere and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open up a</font>

76
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,720
conversation among those who are

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in talking about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

78
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:51,329
so Who am I who's this guy bill Norton I

79
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:55,049
initially worked at at<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit networks</font>

80
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:58,769
for 11 years Betty shared an office with

81
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:00,299
me remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> way back then and during</font>

82
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,890
those 11 years one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things I was</font>

83
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,200
tasked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing was coming up with a</font>

84
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,899
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> case and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a business plan for</font>

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,040
fern<font color="#CCCCCC"> and off for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this event question was</font>

86
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,600
how do we get this thing funded do

87
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,840
registration fees and all that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

88
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,870
off after<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 years of merit I finished</font>

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,880
on my MBA and went to help find<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix</font>

90
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,730
my official title was co-founder and

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,590
chief technical liaison and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that role</font>

92
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I worked with the peering coordinators</font>

93
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to help facilitate their interaction so</font>

94
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,020
a lot of the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going to</font>

95
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:36,119
hear today comes from the nine<font color="#CCCCCC"> or so</font>

96
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,710
years of experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I had working</font>

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the peering community at equinix</font>

98
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:46,260
probably most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me from the</font>

99
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet white papers that I've authored</font>

100
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,789
with the community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really a</font>

101
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,979
public source of information about

102
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,620
peering and internet operations and how

103
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all works back in May of last year</font>

104
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,700
I retired I cashed out my stock and just

105
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">before the collapse of the economy so it</font>

106
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,680
actually timed out about<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but first</font>

107
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know where I'm coming</font>

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,850
from let me say a few words about the

109
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,360
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> white papers that are</font>

110
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,910
freely available for you to to download

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,890
one thing i noticed back in 1998 was

112
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,240
that there were lots of documents

113
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,099
describing protocols and specific

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware technologies and how those work</font>

115
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,880
routing algorithms and convergence and

116
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,040
that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but at that time</font>

117
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,590
nobody had documented the peering

118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,540
process how does it work how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find</font>

119
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,250
out who to peer with how do you choose

120
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,110
whether the period at<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange points to</font>

121
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,870
use point-to-point circuits and that

122
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,610
kind of operations activities so I took

123
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it upon myself to ask some of the</font>

124
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">smartest people in the world like like</font>

125
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ren provo and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan Goulding and Patrick</font>

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,820
Gill well avi Friedman and a variety of

127
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,080
folks and I documented what they said in

128
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,640
the form of a white paper and over

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,500
lunches I would walk other folks through

130
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,690
that white paper and see what they said

131
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,890
and Randy Whitney<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say that's kind</font>

132
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,050
of how it works we need to modify<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

133
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,340
revenge fuller would say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

134
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Genuity we don't actually look at that</font>

135
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">we look at this so through a series of</font>

136
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,860
stepwise refinements over a period<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

137
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,870
100 walkthroughs the white paper evolved

138
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,940
until it pretty much represented the

139
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,790
mindset of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

140
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,770
particular operations topic so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did the</font>

141
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,479
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing again</font>

142
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,359
and again and again with different

143
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,889
operations issues that people thought in

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,639
the internet circle that we all travel

145
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,870
in were critical issues to to document

146
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,120
