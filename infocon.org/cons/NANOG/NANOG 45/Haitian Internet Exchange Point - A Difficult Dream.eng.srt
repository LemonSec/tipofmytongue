15
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:16,320
you have idea let me try to explain why

sustainable development project

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:31,049
sponsored by un un DB and in 2002 they

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:36,530
try to UM they order a technical paper

20
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:41,600
about ought to make all the local<font color="#E5E5E5"> is be</font>

21
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:44,640
setting an exchange point and in this

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:50,639
paper it was only a technical approach

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:53,520
and the they have even found a location

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,020
for this for those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you who knows</font>

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:02,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">Haiti watch colic paw prints there is a</font>

this here is its name its booty VA and

33
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,659
the reason for this is because there is

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,319
a lack of a wired infrastructure in

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:33,900
October 28 in 2007 when something

273
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:19,230
digital and voila they need 3.5 giggles

274

frequency to operate their wimax

275

technology and they made some some

it happens they give them the license

and then

280
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:46,668
they don't have any frequency to use

with their technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the</font>

direct later tried to take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook to</font>

take off the the frequency from the

<font color="#CCCCCC">to buy the small companies because it's</font>

291
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:28,529
the only way they can get their money

292
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,140
back even so they can they kept lose

293
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:35,970
that the the morning they already invest

294
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:39,510
in in the wimax technology but the

295
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:45,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">Impala is even they have the frequency</font>

296
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:48,570
they don't have any license for um to

297
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:51,059
operate for for the wimax technology so

298
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:55,860
that's why I call I call this situation

299
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:58,200
the wimax deadlock so my my main goal

300
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,320
was to talk to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

committee there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> stefan window max</font>

303
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:12,799

304
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:17,429
more help to try to make it happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

309
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,810
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time for one question at least</font>

310
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,430
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have one question asks 2.5</font>

311
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:47,530
gigahertz or three point five gigahertz

312
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:51,730
2.5 2.5 tweet worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 30 3.5 yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

313
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:54,580
if I can channel Ted<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seeley of sprint he</font>

314
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:59,730
says 2.5 is bad enough and 3.5 must be

315
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:04,439
complete garbage no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think so um</font>

316
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:10,300
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there is a one Sen the first</font>

317
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">also got a license to operate wimax and</font>

318
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think they are using the 2.5</font>

319
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:20,230
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joey egli well first off I</font>

320
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,000
wanted to say thanks because it's not

321
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,220
easy to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's a</font>

322
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,440
you know hard pole and I think it's

323
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good to get some experience with</font>

324
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,920
what people routinely face in developing

325
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:35,310
markets when trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy a new I XP</font>

326
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,490
but my other observation was a

327
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,510
presumably most of most of your

328
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:44,200
infrastructures using unlicensed

329
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:47,860
wireless spectrum have you had any luck

330
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:53,440
it with the 5.8 gigahertz unlicensed

331
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:57,879
wimax actually not but we are we are you

332
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:02,650
all the operators are using 2.5 private

333
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,870
license and the back some the company<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

334
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:11,200
work for which is a multi-link one of

335
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:15,959
the ice PS we we are using alvarion

336
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:19,930
equipment with 2.5 regards wall care

337
