82
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:55,349
much people have been drinking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and there is a bar at the</font>

will think I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fill out the survey</font>

146
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,400
okay that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good the other thing is</font>

147
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,050
program committee members have special

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,090
badges I'm actually confused about that

149
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,460
because mine is green are they green

150
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,770
yellow yellow me oh I'm green because

151
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,599
you guys are yellow got it all right so

152
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,248
yeah it's very confusing anyway so

153
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,650
program committee members except for me

154
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:24,090
are yellow and go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this list these</font>

155
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,919
people for<font color="#E5E5E5"> are from all kinds of</font>

156
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">different companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and are very</font>

157
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,279
responsible very smart very cool people

158
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:33,990
and we all put together the program

159
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,879
together um I usually do a quick it used

160
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,979
to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case that we would basically</font>

161
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,840
accept everything that was submitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

162
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,029
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback we got from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the committee</font>

163
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,549
was that's more or less unacceptable

164
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,020
because there's some percentage of the

165
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,789
stuff that's submitted that's just not

166
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,498
appropriate for some reason and you

167
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:52,020
essentially we got the feedback you guys

168
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:53,909
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recruit more good content so</font>

169
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,370
that we could you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not have that</font>

170
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">last sort of twenty percent of stuff we</font>

171
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,279
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see there so we took that</font>

172
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,688
seriously we went out and recruited a

173
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,150
bunch of good talks and we got to the

174
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:05,990
point where now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the position</font>

175
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,060
of having to turn down some decent talks

176
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,060
which use never to be the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for</font>

177
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,589
this now now we had 44 talks submitted

178
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten of them were withdrawn for one</font>

179
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:17,310
reason or other some people couldn't get

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,319
travel approval some people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

181
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,080
change their mind about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

182
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,629
give the talk some people flaked out

183
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,539
because that happens people flake out

184
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:29,279
eight were declined by us there were

185
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,680
some interesting reasons for that some

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,199
you guys would expect insufficiently

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,909
technical or overly marketing there were

188
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,849
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were that way you know</font>

189
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:40,740
just this is a market texture it looks

190
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,539
technical because it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> network maps in</font>

191
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,889
it but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only network mounts</font>

192
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,330
that are appropriate for one vendors

193
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,529
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should</font>

194
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,859
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get their slides off their</font>

195
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">website yes right oh right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there this is</font>

196
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,000
mike mike blair there you go a good

197
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,250
percentage of the declined presentations

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,050
were due to insufficient material they

199
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,000
gave an abstract and nothing more ever

200
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,900
despite prompts that is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">point so so of the list of you</font>

202
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,520
reasons we had that was another one

203
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:09,710
where people there's a fine line we

204
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,508
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

205
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,880
presentations that are as real world

206
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,440
useful as possible if you're presenting

207
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,639
a brand new protocol that nobody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

208
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,469
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use but it's an interesting</font>

209
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,320
protocol will definitely consider it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

210
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,759
you're presenting a case study of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

211
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,650
implementation of something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

212
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,810
nobody's ever presented a case study of

213
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,849
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually did it and it's in use</font>

214
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,740
by your customers you just jump to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

215
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,690
head of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line your your presentations</font>

216
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,250
getting in on the other hand people who

217
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,289
can do that ladder kind of presentation

218
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,599
are busy people running networks and so

219
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes they submit presentations with</font>

220
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,390
an abstract and no slides sometimes they

221
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,770
submit five slides five slides is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

222
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,000
but it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly difficult to</font>

223
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,829
tell what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a 30-minute</font>

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,080
presentation those five slides are going

225
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,820
to turn into so sometimes we ended up

226
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,010
prodding people very hard and sometimes

227
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,750
the prodding failed we had a bunch of

228
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,490
topic audience mismatch where it was

229
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,020
just yeah this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

230
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,000
for some other conference but you guys

231
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,130
aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to like it we had some</font>

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,750
similar presentations but there was

233
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,130
another one that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> already accepted</font>

234
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,400
that we're better and there were a bunch

235
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,870
of just too late to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> in stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

236
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,970
you know the conference is full I'm

237
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,470
sorry so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present it now</font>

238
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,360
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard i mean you know</font>

239
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,430
seeing a eighteen twenty percent decline

240
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,900
rate should encourage you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

241
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,640
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you submit an even vaguely</font>

242
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,010
interesting presentation with more than

243
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,650
five slides roughly on time you'll

244
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,180
probably get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation accepted</font>

245
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,569
26 yeah that's right twenty-six percent

246
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,709
26 were accepted so fifty-eight percent

247
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,690
let me say something about lightning

248
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:40,310
talks everyone here know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightning</font>

249
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:43,640
talks are no yes again with the bar

250
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,680
problem so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an innovation that</font>

251
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,120
Steve Feldman brought to us I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

252
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">you got the idea from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pearl</font>

253
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,910
conferences right is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so other</font>

254
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,320
people in the program committee had sort

255
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,660
of seen this at the pearl conferences

256
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,940
basically we set<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside a decent sized</font>

257
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,760
chunk of time usually somewhere between

258
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,040
two and four half hour slots to be

259
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,760
divided up into<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-minute lightning talk</font>

260
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,040
time periods lightning talks are perfect

261
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,230
for this audience because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

262
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do them in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advance it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

263
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,200
minutes it can be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediate</font>

264
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,199
before you walk on stage or you know

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,540
half an hour before but it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

266
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,920
topical and interesting enough that you

267
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,890
can compete with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other people</font>

268
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,360
who are also procrastinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> / know that</font>

269
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,430
I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say procrastinating slackers</font>

270
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,830
that's not what I meant to say but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

271
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,949
lightning talks are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular because</font>

272
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">they tend to be incredibly zippy fast</font>

273
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,450
paced usually very topical and relevant

274
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,279
we still have a ton of lightning talks

275
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">lots and now is the time to prepare them</font>

276
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,240
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have an idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lightning</font>

277
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:49,330
talk and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to prepare an</font>

278
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,700
abstract and submit it go to nanog pc

279
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,020
org set up a speaker account go to the

280
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lightning top link and submit the</font>

281
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,589
abstract if your abstract is approved

282
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,589
you'll be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next day's lightning</font>

283
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:01,779
talks the lightning talk slots for

284
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:04,000
tomorrow will be announced later tonight

285
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:06,070
so if you've submitted a lightning talk

286
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,500
and you haven't heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> back from us</font>

287
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,480
that's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will if there have been</font>

288
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,970
actually not that many submitted yet so

289
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,029
there's plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for any others</font>

290
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:18,339
any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that so the main</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

291
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:19,870
the reason we come to here is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

292
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,760
know how are we doing what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

293
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,810
priorities for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you</font>

294
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,380
want to see more of what do you want to

295
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,449
see less of what's good what's useless

296
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,790
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that feedback now if I knew a</font>

297
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,520
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of anger one or two of you</font>

298
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,469
enough to make you come to your feet

299
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,720
we're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philly nanog doing</font>

300
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,220
nothing but v6 content we might throw in

301
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,310
a little bit of list but it'll just be

302
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,500
all v6 what we've decided is that ipv4

303
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,140
is pretty useless I mean nobody's using

304
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,790
it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything the porn and spam taking</font>

305
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,640
it over and nobody wants porn I mean

306
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,930
that's clear so yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

307
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,400
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea because it means we actually</font>

308
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,949
get to spend more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time at the pool so</font>

309
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,920
yeah oh that's in philly I don't is

310
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">there a good pool no see there's no good</font>

311
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,240
pool in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philly who said we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font>

312
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,579
Philly well that's I'm sure this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

313
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,709
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it with it for now</font>

314
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry sorry any any other I'm kidding</font>

315
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,890
about the v6 thing the six is never

316
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,430
going to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no transition</font>

317
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,740
path um<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both of those things are</font>

318
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,160
true uh anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else from anyone</font>

319
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,160
feedback

up<font color="#CCCCCC"> fita</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just smite my car I still get a</font>

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,540
payoff from tata communications and a

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,550
member<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the program coming yes that</font>

323
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,660
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yellow tag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

324
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:40,329
have people's opinion about going to

325
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,280
from three<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings a year to two</font>

326
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,190
meetings a year there's an excellent

327
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,860
discussion so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a there's a number</font>

328
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,540
of structural discussions about meetings

329
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,070
that come up periodically how to divide

330
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,260
the time at a meeting how long meeting

331
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,980
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and this is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the topics</font>

332
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that comes up pretty consistently this</font>

333
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,210
is a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is believe it or not related</font>

334
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,690
to the point Joe was making about

335
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,220
sponsorship at the last time we

336
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,070
seriously looked at this embedding can

337
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,740
comment during her time up here the

338
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,840
challenge is that merit has a set of

339
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,880
resources dedicated to supporting nanog

340
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,440
that if you divide them by the revenue

341
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,060
from three meetings it works out

342
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,880
actually pretty well we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing I mean</font>

343
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:25,420
we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big surplus but we're</font>

344
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,370
losing almost no money and making some

345
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,199
money on most meetings and Betty<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

346
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,000
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you go to two</font>

347
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,590
meetings a year the finance<font color="#E5E5E5"> has changed</font>

348
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,900
pretty substantially<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you would need</font>

349
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,370
probably i'm just guessing but a couple

350
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred thousand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars per meeting</font>

351
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,320
extra which is not it's not

352
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">inconceivable it's just that's that's</font>

353
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,890
been the challenge in the past but a

354
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,340
number of its if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's important to</font>

355
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:52,439
people and we and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to revisit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

356
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:55,090
in detail then we will need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously</font>

357
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,950
re-examine current sponsorship models to

358
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,900
be able and probably have to have more

359
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,480
marketing presence to get more dollars

360
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:05,290
in yep and certainly not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal any</font>

361
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:08,080
thunder from<font color="#CCCCCC"> todd or joe there is room</font>

362
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,520
on the survey we actually put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

363
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:14,710
on the survey again asking about venues

364
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,630
specifically trying to draw in input

365
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,210
from the larger community those that are

366
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,220
here those that are watching remotely so

367
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,260
hopefully we can have some continued

368
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,600
discussion here but really really what's

369
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,180
going to make

370
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,490
a significant difference is to complete

371
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,680
the survey and and provide us detailed

372
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:35,040
comments and recommendations so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

373
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,229
just I want this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer some</font>

374
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,050
suggestions on how to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want</font>

375
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,300
knowing if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the financial page</font>

376
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,519
on the nanog website in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vein of</font>

377
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,459
transparency you can see what meetings

378
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost so not only look at what you want</font>

379
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,209
to have happen but look at the money

380
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,730
logistics of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

381
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:56,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending to prepare and provide the</font>

382
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,040
meetings for you and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of those</font>

383
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,500
of you are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stream</font>

384
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,730
and participating remotely the survey is

385
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:08,880
available to remote participants yes

386
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:11,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">Martin and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we'll go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Joel with</font>

387
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,509
great thanks to merit and that's a

388
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,939
statement I've said for many many years

389
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:16,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people have as well what's</font>

390
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting about what you just said is</font>

391
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,779
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's around the wrong way the</font>

392
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:25,190
purpose of the conference is to provide

393
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:27,660
a location and a place for communication

394
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,149
whether it be via the talks or

395
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,449
individuals and so it may be more

396
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:35,880
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen to the attendees and</font>

397
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:37,589
I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> ember ship than to sit and look</font>

398
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,959
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the primary reason for three is</font>

399
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,819
the financing of<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit for the</font>

400
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">conferences the way you said it was a</font>

401
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">little round the wrong way the lid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

402
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:49,670
logic of needing three and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

403
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,768
level of sponsorship makes sense however

404
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,889
and the survey deals with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing for</font>

405
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,920
eight but I can say Sylvie said it and

406
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll say I'd be happy and could come up</font>

407
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,630
with substantiation that's why only two

408
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,439
meetings a year

409
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:07,240
is needed but that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from the</font>

410
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,430
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sponsor and how do you pay</font>

411
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,730
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it statement I'm looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from</font>

412
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:16,510
me imagine me a much estimate welcome

413
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:20,020
you don't know legally program committee

414
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:22,360
member um I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just observe that when</font>

415
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,410
we shack up with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR for one meeting</font>

416
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:29,680
we lose a day of the program anyway and

417
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:31,780
you know given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of effort that</font>

418
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,439
goes in your actually recruiting good

419
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:38,890
material like<font color="#E5E5E5"> even that one is a serious</font>

420
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,500
challenge we have you know we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

421
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,600
lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get through yeah you</font>

422
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,830
know when you add in the buffs and all

423
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,480
that even you know meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

424
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,880
conjunction with error<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron's</font>

425
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,200
substantially detracts from the amount

426
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of material that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can put in the</font>

427
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,470
program today so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just observe</font>

428
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,420
that in the context of a tube meaning

429
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,670
versus a three meeting context because

430
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,889
if we had two meetings with one with

431
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">error then</font>

432
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,480
that you know has that much more

433
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:15,760
implication for the actual length and

434
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:18,579
breadth of the program<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Keith Keith</font>

435
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,790
Mitchell is see it's unclear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me what</font>

436
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,139
the advantages of two meetings are

437
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,629
certainly for right meetings of going

438
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:35,920
from three to two I think there's a loss

439
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:37,300
of continuity as a consequence I'm

440
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,580
positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are people in the</font>

441
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,050
audience to speak to that so I'm not

442
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say your stuff for you so come</font>

443
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,879
to the microphone don't learn um I had a

444
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,740
different thread i'm wondering if i

445
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,990
should back off and let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if this is on that thread</font>

447
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,220
hold on for a second or Becca this is on

<font color="#CCCCCC">time anymore and three meetings is</font>

452
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,990
important to me because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives me an</font>

opportunity to get here when I have an

right this needs more explanation so it

459
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,389
isn't just an issue of now and there's a

460
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:30,460
comment is actually valid I mean there's

461

a great aspect of the Nano of meetings

462
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:36,190
but they aren't in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vacuum we also have</font>

regional some of them also handle the

00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,760
same set of global players so for a

special subset of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hurt nanog</font>

482
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,410
there's actually an awful lot of

<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings that's why from my company's</font>

this these that'd be fine because

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's plenty of other events that go</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes they do come very close or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">snow there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always the question of can</font>

your company be sending somebody else or

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,070
you know maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to send</font>

somebody to every every meeting its

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:55,040
forgiveness keep a meeting did you you

498
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,379
ready to joke I'd actually never thought

499
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,870
about that well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think where it makes a</font>

500
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,450
really really good point in that there

501
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:08,179
are a number of global meetings that

502
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,310
just in scheduling<font color="#CCCCCC"> and anna is difficult</font>

503
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,260
trying to get ahead of the curve or or

504
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:17,810
trying to avoid all the all the various

505
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,330
meetings to host an A&R as a challenge a

number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us who are actually the</font>

509
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,410
meetings had a bit of time to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

510
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,570
we were in LA and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> committed to</font>

511
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,120
having some ongoing discussions of

course all driven by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community but</font>

513
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,520
as logistical planners what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

514
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,700
does it make sense to align our

515
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,590
calendars a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better again this</font>

516
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,200
kind of discussion is important for all

517
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,929
of us you who have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> travel to these</font>

518
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,600
various sites in all of us who have to

519
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">work hard to over to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid overlapping</font>

520
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,040
with each other so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same</font>

521
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,950
goal we just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with ways</font>

522
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,399
to try to solve it and just one other

523
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,960
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin about two years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I</font>

524
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,280
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a conversation going</font>

525
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,560
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you made an important</font>

526
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,780
point it is a subset it's not a small

527
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">subset but it's a very particular subset</font>

528
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,920
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog audience that goes to lots</font>

529
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,230
and lots of international conferences

530
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,760
and the goal and I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're</font>

531
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that subset</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and Sylvia's in that</font>

532
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,879
subset

533
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,350
see you know maybe twenty percent thirty

534
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,270
percent of the people in that room are

535
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,699
people I've seen in Europe I've seen in

536
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,980
Asia so I understand that what what

537
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,710
those people are looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

538
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,990
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things is enough meetings and is a</font>

539
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,880
critical mass at each meeting you

540
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,679
neither want to go to too many meetings

541
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
nor do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to go to a meeting that</font>

542
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,340
has insufficient other people there that

543
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting itself was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not worthwhile I</font>

544
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,689
made a suggestion to a combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

545
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,909
people from Europe North America and

546
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,590
Asia that it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible that</font>

547
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,960
because the main goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those people is</font>

548
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">puring it is a focus on peering and I</font>

549
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,400
made a suggestion to try to put a strong

550
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:59,590
curing focus on a single right meeting a

551
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,929
single apricot meeting in a single nanog

552
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,240
meeting per year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make that meeting</font>

553
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:07,030
have critical mass at that point however

554
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">many other meetings nanog has you know</font>

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,600
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as those are distributed around</font>

556
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,040
the year in an appropriate way you've

557
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,449
solved your problem you have enough

558
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,159
meetings in each of the meetings you go

559
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,870
to as critical mass that conversation

560
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,890
didn't really get anywhere but I'd be

561
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to help you try to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

562
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:24,730
started again let's see we are there

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,710
people and skipping a meeting is

574
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:50,169
unfortunately not actually necessarily a

575
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,490
good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to come here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

576
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,110
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just coming here for</font>

577
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,030
period because leader not that's

578
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,918
actually not why I come here to come

579
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">here to talk to people if I only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come to</font>

580
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,880
to a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you only come to one or</font>

581
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,660
two a year we might not see each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

582
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,660
at all or at most once a year there is a

583
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,220
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know important difference</font>

584
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,260
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing every four months and six</font>

585
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">months there's a much much much larger</font>

586
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,480
difference between having<font color="#CCCCCC"> phase two</font>

587
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">phases</font>

588
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,990
six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every 12 months so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

589
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:22,809
dropping<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to two a year we may</font>

590
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,820
actually see more people come we may see

591
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:26,950
fewer people not come to meetings which

592
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:31,360
is also another problem I mean we didn't

593
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,580
fill the 500 here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right yeah and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

594
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,199
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably you know there's trade-offs</font>

595
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,210
back and forth but I'm just saying I

596
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,010
personally think that you know there's

597
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to two meetings is okay dropping</font>

598
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,179
meetings are not coming actually has a

599
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,429
lot of bad side effects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you may not</font>

600
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:47,380
see until you start doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Brenda</font>

601
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:50,770
that actually segue right who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

602
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">again I'm Braden Ross with desire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> com</font>

603
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:56,020
excellent I'm have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the exact</font>

604
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:58,210
opposite side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that because I tend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

605
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,650
miss although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be coming tonight on</font>

606
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,870
for very long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I tend to miss</font>

607
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,970
meetings periodically and regularly

608
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,530
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other work demands your</font>

609
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,970
personal demands or money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bands or</font>

610
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,070
whatever the heck the problem is at that

611
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,169
time and having three meetings a year

612
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,549
means that if I miss one meeting it's

613
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:14,200
only a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> more months until there's</font>

614
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:17,049
another meeting but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only two</font>

615
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,669
meetings a year now it's an entire year

616
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:22,240
since I've been to an end up if I miss

617
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:24,220
just one meeting so it for me that that

618
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,530
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually worse to have only the two</font>

619
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,750
meetings a year even though granted on

620
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,330
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> less likely to miss one by the</font>

621
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,429
other hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if they don't get</font>

622
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,439
announced say a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> in advance because</font>

623
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:39,610
that's tends to be way my vacation

624
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,530
frequent flyer miles conflicts come from

625
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,139
because i was actually how i missed the

626
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,730
last meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I miss Oh Betty's gonna</font>

627
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for you we're working on</font>

628
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,049
that you're gonna be happy but but still

629
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,160
but still point is still there may if

630
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:53,290
it's inevitable that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna miss a</font>

631
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,610
meeting now it's a whole year between

632
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,559
enough i missed two meetings in a row

633
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,928
holy cow now it's been feels like three

634
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,678
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I've seen anybody in 18</font>

635
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:06,370
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> bez</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> count okay feels like forever</font>

636
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:11,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">I miss you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys we miss you too we love</font>

637
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:13,540
you Brenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay bill you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think</font>

638
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,370
patrick said perfectly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was going</font>

639
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:19,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say regarding the two versus three</font>

640
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:22,090
meeting we are in very tough economic

641
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,150
times aren't we so I think marriage

642
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:28,689
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to take a look at the the</font>

643
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:30,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">finances and keep things sustained over</font>

644
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,320
the next couple years but the new threat

645
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:35,919
i wanted to start had to do more with

646
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:40,168
the program one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

647
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:43,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ren is doing really well is</font>

648
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:46,870
evolving that knob to this orientation

649
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,090
this newcomer orientation each time I

650
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,699
see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new that's being tried and</font>

651
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,320
I really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot and I</font>

652
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,780
would encourage the program committee to

653
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,520
try and do more things more different

654
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,190
things you know if it fails I think

655
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,070
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine this is a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font>

656
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,780
tolerant group of folks that would be

657
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,720
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than happy to try some new things</font>

658
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,790
so I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see you know one or</font>

659
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,470
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in this meeting next time let</font>

660
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,270
you say we're doing something different

661
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:17,110
this time and we'd love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how you</font>

662
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:18,790
feel about you know for breakout

663
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,649
sessions happening at the same time

664
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,740
among these different communities of

665
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:26,440
interests or we're trying a new ad hoc

666
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,480
boss that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen sunday night</font>

668
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,799

671
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just can't organizationally get it off</font>

672
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,790

things at each demo that we try and

677
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,240
hopefully half and them fail but the

678
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,010
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really succeed will be really</font>

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:44,820
driven away from the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and we</font>

714
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,700
do our<font color="#CCCCCC"> best to inform new people that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">have joined the mailing list what the</font>

716
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:55,560
rules are when they kind of slip out of

717
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:57,810
bounds and you won't hear very much from

718
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,210
us you'll really only hear from us when

719
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,010
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has gone truly</font>

720
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,190
drastically wrong and you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

721
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:12,860
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> posts from myself asking people</font>

722
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:16,290
to cut something out so again this is a

723
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,969
community-run mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

your involvement I know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

725
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:22,240
you who used to be on the mailing list

726
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,000
who used to read the mailing list

727
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,500
tribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it regularly and you're very</font>

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,429
knowledgeable include phul people and we

729
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:34,300
need you back on the list contributing

730
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:37,540
and really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring something of</font>

731
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:40,690
value back to it because it is a useful

732
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:43,649
tool when someone needs to reach out to

733
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:48,670
the community as a whole and without you

734
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:52,059
we're a little lost so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

735
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:56,440
sense of<font color="#CCCCCC"> humor I did get some private</font>

736
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:59,649
emails when I complained publicly about

737
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,380
a haiku that went around and you know

738
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,910
what we there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot of humor and a</font>

739
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,260
lot of the post but what we really

740
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,700
expect from you is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

741
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,160
contribute some content to it as well

something out of oh sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there a</font>

745
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:22,720
question over here a request<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and I'm</font>

746
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:25,300
on a number of mailing with some of

747
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,120
which have stats that tell you who

748
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,490
posted hi posting and whatever in the

749
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,739
course of a week or whatever I'm not

750
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:35,290
really interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but there are</font>

751
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,600
some extremely long threads on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

752
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,580
I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people get tired of those I</font>

753
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,500
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really interested in stats</font>

754
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,730
month the month on joins and drops

755
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,650
particularly if those drops are related

756
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to some of those threads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

757
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,420
unfortunately these statistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

758
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:01,710
fallen do a little bit of disrepair so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

759
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:03,960
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have especially anything that</font>

760
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:08,100
granular but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that we</font>

761
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,450
can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I'm sure that it</font>

762
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,949
would actually be very helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

763
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,630
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much damage some of those threads</font>

764
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:18,750
are actually doing to the membership

765
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:21,810
where we left off in October at the last

766
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:25,020
nanog there were only nine people that

767
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had warned and following nanog there</font>

768
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:34,110
was actually one ban November only 5

769
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:35,790
reminders to formal warnings we do

770
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,310
distinguish between the two the<font color="#E5E5E5"> formal</font>

771
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:41,340
warnings are usually for something more

772
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:44,370
severe especially personal attacks which

773
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:48,000
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not take lightly December was</font>

774
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:50,879
quiet and January we had a couple very

775
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,850
long very useless threads going on so a

776
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,630
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were reminded and warned</font>

777
00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,810
about these kind of things so like I

778
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:02,220
said bands very very rare these are

779
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,800
these are not something that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

780
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,080
do I mean we don't want to kick people

781
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,899
out of the community it just doesn't

782
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:13,290
make sense it's not what we're trying to

783
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:16,100
accomplish we only do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> after three</font>

784
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,149
formal warnings so there are a lot of

785
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,649
contributors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up there</font>

786
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,810
and I think they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to step back and</font>

787
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,720
really take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're</font>

788
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:28,230
posting to the list and just so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

789
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,990
understand the ban is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for life we've</font>

790
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:35,100
limited it to the longest remaining time

<font color="#E5E5E5">a per annum LC member has on the mailing</font>

ironic

797

I'm sorry well thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it it</font>

was it there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> medical thread beware</font>

doing that no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so um</font>

00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:33,460
there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also a wiki nanog coupon</font>

dotnet and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that you</font>

808
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,800
could also think about utilizing there's

809
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:42,610
a lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is probably more of</font>

810
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:46,300
a sticky type subject the operators

811
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:48,570
might find useful what the mailing list

812

committee is looking for from<font color="#CCCCCC"> you is</font>

813
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:54,340
some ideas for other possible forums

814
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:59,140
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been tossing around internally the</font>

815
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:02,860
idea of creating a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web-based forum or</font>

816
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:05,200
even going to a fully moderated list not

817
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,350
leaving the main list as is but running

818
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:14,290
in parallel a moderated list in which we

819
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:17,080
would forward substantive postings we'd

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get some discussion going this</font>

the right time but Randy and myself are

nanog on nanog futures and we could take

any small questions now or you can feel

free to email us at any time Steve

of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did want to have one</font>

hard to bring into<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance is the level</font>

837
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,599
of moderation what's appropriate was not

838
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,339
appropriate on the main list judging by

839
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:14,650
the fact we've had a few complaints

840
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:16,299
recently I tend to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're fed</font>

841
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,240
a pretty good balance but I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

842
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:22,029
encourage everyone here anyone on the

list listening whatever to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you</font>

850
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,099
be worth well re focusing the discussion

851
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,490
again on may be splitting the list up

852
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:53,799
into a couple different<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas maybe not</font>

853
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,390
here maybe not right now but it might be

878
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,549
discussion as with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our meetings</font>

879
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,799
that we have it's important for merit to

880
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,010
acknowledge we can't do these meetings

881
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,160
alone and the thoughtfulness of our

882
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,319
hosts going forward or<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming forward</font>

to host and an August truly appreciated

885
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:28,790
by us at merit and certainly by the

886
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,609
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we want to give them their</font>

887
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:34,759
due the contributors as well sometimes

888
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:37,009
contributors are really under under

889
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:41,270
represented they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually give us</font>

890
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:43,849
cash or do as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a host but there</font>

891
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,700
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> key pieces of the infrastructure</font>

892
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:49,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that make this meeting possible so if</font>

893
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,540
you haven't said thank you to some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

894
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:54,640
the folks that are here from these

895
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:57,680
agencies or set them an email please do

896
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,470
the break sponsors are also important

897
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,790
they get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of being here and</font>

898
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,348
talking to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you but more</font>

899
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,450
importantly we get some financial

900
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:07,849
contribution from them and at this

901
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,529
meeting it has been very very very

902
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:11,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">helpful to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a few more breaks</font>

903
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,950
buzzers beer and gear<font color="#CCCCCC"> our traditional</font>

904
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:20,390
sponsors I think the report early on is

905
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:21,890
that it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a successful return for</font>

906
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,520
the sponsors to come here to the

907
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:27,650
Dominican Republic and be here to be

908
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,059
with you when we plan this meeting we

909
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,790
weren't really sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there would be</font>

910
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:34,309
a following and its really really nice

911
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:36,049
to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the spots are still believe</font>

912
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:37,819
in the model although<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have some</font>

913
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:41,119
recommendations and changes we might

914
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:43,369
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider as well our social</font>

915
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,460
other social sponsor this evening is an

916
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:48,980
important part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our visit here to the</font>

917
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,410
Dominican Republic<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you haven't</font>

outstanding

921
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,240
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a few minutes tonight</font>

922
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,580
so that we're not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this in</font>

923
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,290
the hallway conversations or as part of

924
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,990
the important agenda for the meeting

925
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:08,270
itself tomorrow but give you my two

929
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:19,220
home at merit and certainly here why

930
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:22,850
does merit want to do this why does

931
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:28,040
merit merit this nonprofit organization

932
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:30,770
that is particularly not a national

933
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,570
player very important in our regional

934
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,630
state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan but why do we want to</font>

937
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:44,420
because the mission of<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit if you go</font>

to our merit<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage merit ddu you'll</font>

939
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:49,460
see that our philosophy has been and

940
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,630
continues to be about building a

941
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:56,390
community base serving as a facilitator

942
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:59,390
to our members<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we see an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ANA of all</font>

943

945
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:06,319
community and through that membership

946
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,810
we're serving our mission as a

947
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,150
non-profit in Michigan so there's the

948
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:13,040
linkage why do we do it because we see

949
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,140
our philosophy at merit is building

950
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,259
communities and we want to be a part of

951
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">this community we're not driving</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the financial information in our working</font>

that you elect if we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a trusted</font>

email me email our CEO Don Walsh who's

00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,089
the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> points of being a</font>

community-based organization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

975
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:20,880
we're a trusted source we believe that

976
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:23,670
through those missions above we take

977
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,210
back to our state the educational and

978
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:29,880
research development ideas which is all

979
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,640
about what we started many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

984
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,570
with us to these meetings and it's the

985
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,670
knowledge transfer that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> gain from</font>

986

being a part of the community with you

987

1036
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,210
getting you all registered for the

1037
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:10,670
meetings keeping the demographic of who

1038
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:13,670
was here and in all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes with that</font>

1039
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,320
the meeting logistics they're all

1040
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,350
different every meeting we have our

1041
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:22,840
nanog stories that we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell but</font>

1042
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:25,759
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit staff do a lot to make banana</font>

1043
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,460
community meetings and the community

1044
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,760
work as a whole certainly we work with

1045
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:34,640
the community committees and we see

1046
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,790
their role as very very instrumental in

1047
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,520
making all of this work now the

1048
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:43,400
important one I know hook the peas again

1049
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:46,700
sorry Nana or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44 you all like to hear</font>

1050
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the look the revenue it's right</font>

1051
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">here it didn't line up quite as well so</font>

1052
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,250
it kind of rumbles our roles together

1053
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,500
there but the revenue from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

1054
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:56,330
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 355 thousand eight hundred and</font>

1055
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,890
ninety-eight dollars and sixty-two cents

1056
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:01,100
so that's what we took in from

1057
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:04,790
registration and sponsorship<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1058
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:07,130
expenses<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we attributed to that</font>

1059
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:10,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting in the way expenses happen are</font>

1060
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:13,790
those expenses that were just for the

1061
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:16,040
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the quarterly expenses of</font>

1062
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:19,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit overhead or staff charges</font>

1063
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,620
assigned to that meeting so for that

1064
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,120
meeting the expenses charged to the

1065
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,589
activity was<font color="#E5E5E5"> three hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

1066
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,810
thousand eight hundred and eighty eight

1067
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:29,180
dollars and ninety-nine cents the

1068
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,029
expenses<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakdown in those categories</font>

1069
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,490
the salary nonsense

1070
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,650
we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what those mean and salary</font>

1071
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:38,770
is made up of equipment excuse me

1072
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,930
equipment supplies staff travel hosting

1073
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:44,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the general overhead what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

1074
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:46,419
nanog for its share of the merit rent

1075
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,109
and insurance and legal fees and all the

1076
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:52,960
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we all know what G</font>

1077
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:55,810
DNAR that means that the Nano of 44

1078
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,270
balance is 47 thousand nine dollars and

1079
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:03,190
sixty-three cents I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make an</font>

1080
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:06,430
important point that balance does not go

1081
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:09,370
back into the merit general fund if you

1082
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:13,029
will there is a separate account back at

1083
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:15,880
it merit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is set aside to carry</font>

1084
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:18,130
forward these balances those balances

1085
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,570
are used because in order for us to

1086
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:25,270
accomplish the next set of meetings we

1087
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,550
have to have cash reserve we have to

1088
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:31,210
have cash reserve in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> account to</font>

1089
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">go out and submit hotel contracts so</font>

1090
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:35,200
that's why this whole discussion about

1091
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,850
two meetings a year three meetings a

1092
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,049
year should we go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

1093
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:42,250
locations new locations and all of those

1094
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:44,650
discussion points that you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1095
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:47,440
survey and that will be having over the

1096
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:49,810
next few days are important as Joe

1097
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,510
mentioned it's been a goal of not only

1098
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nana but the steering committee to get</font>

00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,870
this meeting the new website will be up

1107

around what happens for nanog 49 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> June</font>

00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:49,660
serious capital outlay and a serious

1139
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:52,900
level of trust from the board at married

1140
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:56,980
to actually underwrite all these

1141
00:48:52,900 --> 00:49:00,940
contracts thank you I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to echo</font>

1142
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:03,430
that but at the same time I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1143
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,530
these clashing at all with any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1144
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:08,049
future meetings or were you able to

00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">position them so we don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1146
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:14,799
awkward period of time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look on</font>

1150
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:26,200
there there's there's some closeness

1151
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:28,450
some may not be as comfortable with the

1152
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:33,098
closeness of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meetings but we're not</font>

1153
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:35,529
overlapping so I answered<font color="#E5E5E5"> but didn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">answer no we're not clashing but we're</font>

1155
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:41,799
close to some of the other meetings well

1156
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:47,559
um not were we tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be close to ripen</font>

1157
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:49,420
in October June I mean there is like we

1158
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:49,809
overlap with and dead not this time we

1159
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,390
over

1160
00:49:49,809 --> 00:49:55,749
with with pack<font color="#CCCCCC"> nog for a piece of of</font>

1163
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:09,279
not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the best of scenarios as we</font>

1164
00:50:06,009 --> 00:50:10,869
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next year the next set of</font>

1167
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,739
quite where we wanted to be but it's it

1168
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:20,049
was important for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to get</font>

1177
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:46,150
alignment just to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> us here now I</font>

1178
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,279
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to say we're in the driver's</font>

1179
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,170
seat yeah i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would know</font>

1180
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:52,479
that when we were building this buffer

1181
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:55,569
time there would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be conflicts because</font>

00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:57,368
other meetings have gotten further ahead

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and they're scheduling and now</font>

1184
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:03,249
we're more in the given given this

1185
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:05,109
schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're more in the future cloud</font>

1186
00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:08,319
where other folks don't have stakes in

1187
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:10,749
the ground so we're all able to plan

1188
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:13,509
around each other a little better I'll

1189
00:51:10,749 --> 00:51:15,189
just got that there have been other

1190
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:16,599
groups especially some of the more

1191
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:19,299
regional knobs that have tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1192
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:22,029
schedule around us and said dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1193
00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:23,679
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and because we haven't</font>

enough in advance we've ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1196
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">stepping on each other this way will be</font>

1197
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:30,839
there they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> schedule around us as</font>

1198
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:30,839
they want

1199
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:36,370
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it clear in kc</font>

1200
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,919
because I we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a lot about this but</font>

1201
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:41,410
it didn't come real clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me the the</font>

1202
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,120
SC actually spent a lot of time looking

1203
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:44,950
at where all the other meetings were and

1204
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,509
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> made you know very clear conscious</font>

1205
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:48,460
decisions based on the limitations we

1206
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,290
had inside of you know where we could

1207
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,900
get space which hotels were open and

1208
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:55,509
what the other meetings were and we very

1209
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,670
made a gigantic effort to not step on

1210
00:51:55,510 --> 00:52:00,130
other meetings whenever possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if</font>

1211
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:04,060
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the calendar that's not</font>

1212
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:05,820
physically possible so I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

1213
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:08,380
you know some work looking at like where

1214
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,910
the overlap was like a favor copper

1215
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,350
overlaps more than ripe does and things

1216
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,490
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we try to pick meeting</font>

1217
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:14,170
diamonds<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be the least</font>

1218
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:16,930
inconvenient for the least number of

1219
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:19,990
people and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> failed I'm sorry but</font>

1220
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:23,049
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for lack of trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and</font>

1221
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:24,850
the very concrete more honest way of

1222
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying we've gotten out ahead of the</font>

1223
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,540
other meetings is that now there will

1224
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,100
continue to be roughly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as many</font>

1225
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:34,779
conflicts but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to blame it on</font>

1226
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:37,259
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else well and as I mentioned</font>

1227
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:40,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that going forward</font>

1228
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:43,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Merritt is now finding engaging</font>

1229
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:46,750
conversations with other organizations

1230
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:49,750
who are working to schedule with us or

1231
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:51,820
near us there's there's a whole

1232
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:55,420
different dialogue that's going on

1233
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">beside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net-net internationally with</font>

1234
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,490
those that do meeting planning as

1235
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:02,799
opposed to just what date do you have

1236
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:05,410
but really what date and where are you

1237
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at so there's a whole level of</font>

1238
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:12,310
additional dialogue that's going on that

1239
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:13,420
supports the community agendas the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1240
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,490
useful thing to point out is

1241
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:19,030
specifically there are locations that

1242
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:20,680
people have asked us to schedule that we

1243
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,420
haven't been<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get because we</font>

1244
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:26,049
haven't scheduled far enough out in

1245
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:28,180
advance<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a comcast in Philly we only</font>

1246
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,770
got because there was a big cancellation

1247
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,990
but if there hadn't been a big

1248
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:33,580
cancellation in general all the good

1249
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:35,049
hotels in philly booked up a year in

1250
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,540
advance and if we're scheduling<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1251
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,250
months in advance we're screwed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chicago</font>

out how to go back to Chicago 10 if you

we'll go chase him New Orleans<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

1278
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:35,780
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> please somebody New Orleans New</font>

1279
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:37,430
Orleans p<font color="#CCCCCC"> templin tex-link / back West</font>

1280
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,870
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the sake of talking about</font>

1281
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:42,259
travel inside to keep in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1282
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:44,240
Austin as far as i know is a hub for no

1283
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,980
one so most folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to have to</font>

1284
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,709
connect unless they are coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font>

1285
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,210
tops just a small factory well that

1286
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,950
that's another one of these decision

1287
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:54,530
points about locations you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either go</font>

1288
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:56,990
to an easy travel location like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago</font>

1289
00:54:54,530 --> 00:55:00,620
and wind up needing to book far in

1290
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:03,709
advance and have a pricier hotel or you

1291
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,870
or if you go to Austin yeah it's a tier

1292
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 and everybody have everybody will have</font>

1293
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:10,220
to take at least one connection but

1294
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:12,200
conversely it can be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> affordable in</font>

1295
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:14,930
some of the some of the venues or easier

1296
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,990
to book and and here's the key budget

1297
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:19,609
number again I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1298
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:21,259
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these numbers most of</font>

1299
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:23,920
the time so I just want to point out to

1300
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:27,140
the community the decision about

1301
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,690
location fits right<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that number</font>

1302
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:32,420
that says a hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty eight</font>

1303
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:37,690
thousand dollars so there's a direct

1304
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:41,210
relationship in the budget to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> venue</font>

1305
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:43,430
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a big deal I mean we can</font>

1306
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:46,250
make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> work but again because we're all</font>

1307
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:48,890
community-based and at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1308
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:50,660
day we're all looking at that bottom

1309
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:53,569
number so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1310
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:56,240
have a reserve going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's okay</font>

1311
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:57,630
with us we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> all have to realize that</font>

1312
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:02,189
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-stop</font>

1313
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:04,950
city will cost more money well and just

1314
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:07,650
I'm going to grossly oversimplified but

1315
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:09,328
it's some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be true look at</font>

1316
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:13,740
three cities from a financial

1317
00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:18,240
perspective the Redmond if Bellevue of

nanog<font color="#CCCCCC"> la nanog and Albuquerque now So La</font>

1319
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">nanog really expensive location because</font>

1320
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:25,380
it's a big city<font color="#CCCCCC"> but so many people came</font>

1321
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,940
that we made<font color="#E5E5E5"> money I mean was one of the</font>

00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,349
best attendant down on severn because

1323
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,690
it's in a location a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people can</font>

1327
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:38,400
expensive but we made it up in

1328
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:41,670
attendance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bellevue pretty expensive</font>

1329
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,960
location decent location but not enough

1330
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,910
people came and so it was well attended

1331
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,119
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well attended and</font>

1332
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:49,529
so we lost money on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Albuquerque</font>

1333
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,789
mediocre to crappy location I lived

1334
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:52,410
there for eight years i'd go with crappy

1335
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:54,480
some people say mediocre it's just you

1336
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:56,460
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective but it's not easy for</font>

1337
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,839
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to not a big local</font>

1338
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,369
population<font color="#E5E5E5"> only we had some local</font>

1339
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:01,019
attendance but didn't matter because all

1340
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:02,789
the hotel costs were so cheap we made a

1341
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:04,740
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money on it so these are</font>

1342
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:06,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">the kinds of that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of scenario</font>

1343
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,970
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get it in an expensive place</font>

1344
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's easy to get to end so many people</font>

1345
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:12,899
will come it doesn't matter that the

1346
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:14,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">hotel costs a bunch of money or do you</font>

1347
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,650
put some of them in more out of the way

1348
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:19,259
cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> locations knowing that you're</font>

1349
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:21,809
not going to get you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 600 people but</font>

1350
00:57:19,259 --> 00:57:23,940
you might get 300 people so these are I

1351
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:25,740
mean and both are fine like what we want

1352
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,019
is input from people of what do you want

1353
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,549
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do me I mean the other</font>

thing that nobody I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean people have</font>

00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:33,630
referred to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is that nano</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm fun we'd</font>

1356
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like to have a million bucks in</font>

1357
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,450
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of a couple hundred</font>

1358
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand bucks in there because it</font>

1359
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:40,109
increases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flexibility that we have</font>

to do stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in advance it's not</font>

1361
00:57:40,109 --> 00:57:42,660
we're not just my me we are

1362
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,579
money-grubbing people but it's not just

1363
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">money grubbing right we actually want to</font>

1364
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:48,210
be able to do more stuff and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1365
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,380
goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sponsorship question of</font>

1368
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:55,919
gear at more time and we get more money

1369
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:58,410
from it do you want sponsored you know

1370
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,440
little rooms where people buy you crap

1371
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:03,299
and buy you drinks and feel at<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like</font>

1374
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:08,110
conferences you get filled at and those

1375
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:09,520
conferences make money

1376
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,770
off of that and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do any of that</font>

1380
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:18,640
but it just means we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be</font>

1383
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,720
slide back up again what was the balance

1384
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,490
that was brought forward from the

1385
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:34,359
previous meeting 35,000 I believed

1386
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:37,509
33,000 it's on the website I'm sorry but

1387
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:39,940
it made up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 38 thousand dollar</font>

1388
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:41,470
loss we had from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting before so</font>

1389
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:45,640
they're all there funny how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens</font>

1390
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah and then to touch point as much as</font>

1391
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:51,339
you've got all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the comments about</font>

1392
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:54,490
the different cities<font color="#E5E5E5"> with 44 after this</font>

1393
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:56,020
45 meetings in our pocket surely there

1394
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:58,299
must be some statistical information

1395
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:01,140
there that really shows whether you know

1396
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:03,910
last minute local people versus

1397
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Albuquerque actually is a good idea</font>

1398
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:08,529
there must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> as either there's some</font>

1399
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:10,839
data there or there isn't an enormous

1400
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:12,820
amount of data but analyzing it is is

1401
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">very complex because they're cyclical</font>

1402
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,140
there are weather factors there are

1403
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:19,509
local factors there are cycles of our

1404
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:21,520
business factors so did Salt Lake City

1405
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:23,350
have low attendance because it was

1406
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,290
immediately post bomb or because it was

1407
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:27,880
salt lake city I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1408
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:30,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you make a great point the data is there</font>

1409
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there isn't any reason why we can't</font>

1410
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:34,870
find a place to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

1411
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:39,149
so it's all graft it's been shared and

1412
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:39,150
we can certainly do that good point oh

1413

differences was the primary driver there

1421
00:59:56,609 --> 01:00:01,828
as well as f going forward you would

1422
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:05,910
have been considering any other place in

ascertain how you balance it no a great

1426
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:15,118
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering when it would come</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">up certainly back home at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt I was</font>

goals for going to the Dominican

1430
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:26,160
Republic why do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take nanog</font>

1431
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:28,819
for the first time out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> North America</font>

1432
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,230
had many discussions even with the

1433
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">steering committee that was in place two</font>

1434
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:34,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the current steering</font>

committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those very issues so</font>

1436
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:38,400
i'll give you my three goals I don't

1437
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:40,680
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's exactly shared by</font>

1438
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,170
everyone but they're the three goals

1439
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:46,828
that i shared with merit as the reason a

1440
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:48,540
tiny<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonprofit not tiny a non-profit in</font>

1441
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:50,940
michigan that's owned by the public

1442
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:54,259
universities in the state would want to

1443
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:57,839
support taking this organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1444
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:59,460
20-some years old primarily doing very

1445
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,680
well in north america to the caribbean

1446
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:05,430
well there were three reasons the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

1447
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:08,129
one is we wanted to be able to stretch

1448
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:10,609
the community we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

1449
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:14,640
take nanog and its mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> and goals</font>

1450
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:17,430
into an area of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1451
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,940
Caribbean where we see this community

1452
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:23,009
building philosophy badly needed and I

1453
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,380
say it's badly needed because even when

1454
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:28,260
we talked about coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana or</font>

1455
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:31,020
come excuse me taking nanog to the

1456
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,690
Caribbean is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of Aaron the</font>

1457
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">american Registry of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet numbers or</font>

1458
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:40,290
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of lack Nick bringing</font>

1459
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:42,960
nanog here where a neutral player we're

1460
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:45,569
here to facilitate the needs of the

1461
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">operators not align ourselves with one</font>

1462
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:50,369
organization or another so that was one

1463
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:54,420
goal hopefully we've met that by being

1464
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:56,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to bring a facilitation of the</font>

1465
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:58,799
Caribbean operators and an<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience</font>

1466
01:01:56,549 --> 01:02:01,530
the second goal allowing folks who

1467
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:03,089
perhaps don't travel outside of the area

1468
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:05,700
the Caribbean area

1469
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:07,469
generally often exposure to the

1470
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,808
operators around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do</font>

1471
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:12,029
travel so there's the transfer of

1472
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:14,400
knowledge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might happen from all of</font>

1473
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:17,339
these folks attending this meeting being

1474
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,349
here with the operators of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> region we</font>

1475
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:20,849
won't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> until someone tells us oh it</font>

1476
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:24,150
was a great meeting and we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1477
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:27,869
discussion and then thirdly the reason

1478
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:31,349
for coming here was that from being here

1479
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:34,619
being the kind of organization that we

1480
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:37,859
are we left something behind we leave

1481
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:41,219
some goal some value that either the

1482
01:02:37,859 --> 01:02:43,339
operators would aspire to build for

1483
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:46,650
themselves or that we've at least

1484
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:49,739
provided connectivity or help a start-up

1485
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:53,099
provider in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area have something</font>

1486
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:55,499
better to service the area from having

1487
01:02:53,099 --> 01:03:00,809
worked with us so those were my three

1488
01:02:55,499 --> 01:03:03,988
lofty goals for being here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally</font>

1489
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:05,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's a it's a great thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net</font>

1490
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:08,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">August being held down here the VOA</font>

1491
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:11,700
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see or one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenges</font>

1492
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:14,308
I see is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is perceived as you</font>

1493
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:17,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">know kind of a vacation destination a</font>

1494
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:19,049
great place to go and as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

1495
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:21,119
hard to justify internally to some

1496
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:22,619
companies that this is actually a work

1497
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,489
trip this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not me trying to get some</font>

1498
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:30,539
vacation benefits but let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1499
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:34,410
were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before mining money</font>

1500
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:36,390
oh the the money thing commercialization

1501
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,399
my suggestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past</font>

1502
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:41,788
surveys I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been any</font>

1503
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:45,479
one who said nanog is too commercial oh

1504
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:48,390
yes there have their have now it's not

1505
01:03:45,479 --> 01:03:49,979
it is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the din that it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been in</font>

1506
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:52,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past but we do get complaints about</font>

1507
01:03:49,979 --> 01:03:54,718
<font color="#E5E5E5">it periodically there is a balance to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1508
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">strong okay I think we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go more</font>

1509
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,160
commercial my own personal perspective a

1510
01:03:56,789 --> 01:04:01,410
lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> members of the SC believe</font>

1511
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,359
that and the pc and part of the question

1512
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:04,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">i put out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when i was talking is you know</font>

1513
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:07,140
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from you how much is</font>

1514
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be too much do we do we try to</font>

1515
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:12,118
do some incremental steps and see what's

1516
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:15,420
painful or do we make some large steps

1517
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,810
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell the email addresses that's</font>

1518
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:19,960
the dividing line

1519
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:21,460
the point i mean this this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming let</font>

1520
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,620
me point out from the man who sold

1521
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:29,140
sponsorship space on his badge at the

1522
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:32,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">los angeles a non so yes I want to</font>

1523
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:35,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually address both bills climbing to</font>

1524
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,940
the one before we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the steering</font>

1525
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:40,180
committee are looking at this much

1526
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,620
distant model we are not assuming that

1527
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,930
what we have now is what the community

1528
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:46,950
wants we're not trying to really see

1529
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:50,770
much of anything so input is definitely

1530
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:53,950
requested to the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> question about</font>

1531
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:55,120
why we're here flip answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because</font>

1532
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:58,149
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got too many complaints about</font>

1533
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:00,190
Toronto so we tell you to go somewhere

1534
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:03,160
warm but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a large part of the</font>

1535
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">real answer is because of josh and</font>

1536
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:09,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">Terremark stepping up and offering the</font>

1537
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:10,870
idea they put a lot of effort into

1538
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:14,140
making it so that we could get here so

1539
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:16,330
that some of the issues that we would

1540
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:18,970
normally have with international travel

1541
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:20,590
and shipping would be smoothed over we

1542
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:22,629
have a lot of cooperation from the

1543
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:26,290
government of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative public</font>

1544
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:33,300
because of tear marks help so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1545
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:35,920
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a lot of things and and we did</font>

1546
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:38,920
was a bet a year ago this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1547
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:43,510
before that we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide</font>

1548
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:46,420
okay do we beware in Caribbean if we're

1549
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:51,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming where should we go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Santo</font>

1550
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:52,690
Domingo became logical choice probably

1551
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:56,980
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> terremark has operations here</font>

1552
01:05:52,690 --> 01:06:00,430
partly because the government help the

1553
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:02,460
economy is friendly to us well I've good

1554
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:05,980
reason for being here it's not a huge

1555
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:08,200
tourist destination like somewhere else

1556
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:11,560
might have been but it's a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> city a</font>

1557
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:16,210
place able to support us and hopefully

1558
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:17,830
we can return the<font color="#CCCCCC"> favor by bringing or</font>

1559
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:18,230
by sharing our knowledge and then

1560
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning</font>

1561
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:25,040
from people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here yeah I'll dragon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1562
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:28,549
must say that I'm thankful that you did

1563
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:32,090
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initiative to come down this</font>

1564
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:35,600
way because we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

1565
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:39,470
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network operators community and</font>

1566
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,910
as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1567
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:43,459
way that things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are structured and stuff</font>

1568
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:46,430
my would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure who I have to</font>

1569
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:48,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">interact with but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

1570
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:51,379
out more about how you you continually

1571
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:55,089
motivate people to actually be active

1572
01:06:51,380 --> 01:07:00,230
because that is the main thing that keep

1573
01:06:55,090 --> 01:07:02,840
is delaying the movement<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward the</font>

1574
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:04,550
more that people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on oh I'm</font>

1575
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,160
too busy and that kind of stuff on and

1576
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:10,310
not considering the value in the

1577
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:14,649
interaction so I'm curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

1578
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:17,270
lean you think that you have done the

1579
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:19,070
pathways that you've gone through trying

1580
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:22,700
to learn more about the history that

1581
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:25,460
you've gone to get to this place so that

1582
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:27,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build something going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

1583
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:29,720
so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who to interact me that</font>

1584
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:33,740
ticket always point well I'm sure your

1585
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,810
question will engage a lot of folks in

1586
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,549
this room to come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> find you and have</font>

1587
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:41,390
a conversation with you you can

1588
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:43,070
certainly find me around I'm here there

1589
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:46,190
and everywhere around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting venue</font>

1590
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:50,119
and look for anyone with a yellow badge

1591
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:51,859
or what color are we blue which are

1592
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:53,660
members of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various committees and</font>

1593
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:57,880
I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can impart some</font>

1594
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:57,879
wisdom are some thoughts on that subject

1595
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:02,930
Suzanne Wolfe I see as far as the

1596
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">question about</font>

1597
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:07,279
and how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go in what direction to</font>

1598
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:09,050
take it I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you need to worry</font>

1599
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,569
about whether people are going to be

1600
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:13,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">offended by banners at you know sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1601
01:08:11,569 --> 01:08:16,250
the overt commercialization kinds of

1602
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:18,559
things maybe as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as historically we</font>

1603
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,540
tend to think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because now I came</font>

1604
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,239
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an academically based community</font>

1605
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:25,069
many of us in the room and at the

1606
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:28,818
meeting came out of that same background

1607
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:32,420
but we've changed times have<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1608
01:08:28,819 --> 01:08:37,009
now it's a lot to change to the thing

1609
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:39,859
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be concerned about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the balance</font>

1610
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:44,120
between sponsorship and revenue and

1611
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:45,980
content because people do trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana to</font>

1612
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:49,339
be a place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font>

1613
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:51,139
the industry's screwing up or people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1614
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:53,390
not handling this set of issues well and

1615
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:56,719
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need names because that's just</font>

1616
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:58,790
not how we've ever operated but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1617
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,100
a there's an expectation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

1618
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:03,019
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to say we as the industry</font>

1619
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,250
or we as the internet are not doing

1620
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,380
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be doing or are</font>

doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something we should it and I'd</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hate to see you is that duly noted duly</font>

1623
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:15,620
noted I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap it up so</font>

1624
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:19,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get off to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reception we</font>
