14
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,980
bit about a or an organizational members

study that we did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Society</font>

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,089
supported by organizational members and

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,148
we studied what they're doing in their

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,399
networks with ipv6 we have some

19
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,589
observations that we've made on the

20

situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> with regard to be four run out</font>

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,270
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to operators about transition</font>

24

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,659
Dave got into earlier this morning so

27
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,159
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Society has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 90</font>

28
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,280
organization members and they represent

<font color="#E5E5E5">all sorts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different kinds of entities</font>

government organizations all of whom

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,780
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of operational network so</font>

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">during late last summer we decided to</font>

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,619
ask them about what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in</font>

37
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,920
their networks with v6 and they were

38
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">very happy to participate it's also</font>

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,060

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,380
talked about vary greatly in size from

43
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,809
very small to very large organizations

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,339
we have supporters on we have

45
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,929
organization members from every

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,160
continent except Antarctica so we asked

47
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,710
them about what they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in their</font>

v4

49

works and what their v4 networks were

50
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,630
like and mostly what they were doing in

51
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,120
their v6 networks and what they were

52
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,510
like of the 90 members that we canvassed

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,520
them somewhere around 25 responded all

54
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,380
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are doing something in v6 which</font>

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,080
is not surprising it's a little bit

56
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-selecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of what</font>

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the highlights of what they told us</font>

59
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,730
we asked them about what sort of

60
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,530
allocation they had in utilization they

61
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,510
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> in before and we have people who</font>

62
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,360
range from just consuming a few

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,359
addresses to people who consume upwards

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,950
of / aids and multiple / aids we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,150
them about the utilization and whether

66
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not there would be any point in time</font>

67
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">at which they would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to or would be</font>

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to or be willing to return any of</font>

69
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,560
their v4 allocation and almost all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

70
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">them said no and almost all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them said</font>

71
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,230
that they anticipate going to get more

72
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,210
addresses very soon we asked them what

73
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,519
would happen if they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a v4</font>

74
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,900
address allocation and your response

75
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,200
came back<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't have anymore</font>

76
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,080
and they said naturally try to be more

77
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,730
efficient and to use more NAT and I

78
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,680
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think any of them said we'll try</font>

79
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,000
to move more stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to these six then</font>

80
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,610
we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of them are working on</font>

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,320
that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of interesting</font>

82
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,300
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the predominant response in</font>

83
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,910
terms of what are the advantage of ipv6

84
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,150
is it has more addresses but there's a

85
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,920
gap in between as we know between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

86
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,570
people actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and what</font>

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are able to do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask people</font>

88
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,320
about specific business drivers that

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,160
they had and the two high runners in

90
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,170
this were needing to have v6 capability

91
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,120
in order to test v6 products that they

92
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,980
were in the process of developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,100
responding to a customer demand for use

94
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,859
of v6 and we asked them about specific

95
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,200
advice that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had four others</font>

96
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,840
intended and deploy to deploy v6 and

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,010
they said do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now and be aware that</font>

98
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,920
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some pretty high</font>

99
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,530
training curves because V for knowledge

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,380
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> automatically translate into v6</font>

101
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,970
operational knowledge so we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

102
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a report published on that and I</font>

103
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,009
put the link up in the previous slide I
