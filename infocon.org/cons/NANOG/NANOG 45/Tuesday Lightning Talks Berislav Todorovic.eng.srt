1
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:10,200
hi there yes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest majority of you</font>

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not operating ccTLDs but there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">people from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that community so that</font>

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,869
yesterday a la fiesta a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">from our different domain name</font>

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,779
registries that's the story primarily

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,460
for them but also for network operators

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,830
because we are hosting their servers

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:37,760
while on the other hand it's not their

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:40,829
problem it's also our problem because if

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,699
there till these are not operating

12
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:47,850
properly our customers will get problems

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:53,449
so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this story about it's nothing</font>

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">new it's nothing you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know already</font>

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,289
there were already cases that you that

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,820
were we were speaking a couple of days

17
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:10,159
already like Pakistani telecom like the

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:25,460
everyone who wants to steal your bidipi

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:29,250
your traffic can do it easily by using

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:32,579
the mechanisms that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist within DDP</font>

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,860
already because is the way how bgp works

24
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,508
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flaw you know that already</font>

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:44,600
right all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us understand well what it</font>

26
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:48,110
means however ccTLD operators often or

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:52,399
sometimes don't understand those things

28
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:58,320
properly and don't take the messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

29
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:02,070
pillows oven<font color="#CCCCCC"> cappella seriously what can</font>

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,479
be a possible consequence of that you

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,030
will see that in this presentation well

32
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:12,709
they might take this as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution but</font>

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,709
that wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good idea</font>

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,460
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really what is really has</font>

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,820
changed compared to the good old times

36
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,540
is that nowadays more people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access</font>

to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be speaking routers may be</font>

40
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:41,100

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:05,730
can you do a possible scenario of course

47
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:09,450
I hope this one won't happen and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

that are providers these days do manual

taking obvious things the second method

providers are relying on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set objects</font>

and in a a set object you cannot claim

that any party on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is your</font>

but not the least Louis four outs yes

if you take days to fix the polluted
