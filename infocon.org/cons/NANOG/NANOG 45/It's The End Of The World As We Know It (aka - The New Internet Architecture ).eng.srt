00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,069
here we go hey I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> echo</font>

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,509
everybody some thanks to everyone and

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,340
it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing all that</font>

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,469
you're in the Dominican Republic and

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,200
seeing all our friends so here's a talk

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">come this side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this came to me at the</font>

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,279
last night ugh because it was very

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,820
interesting the way folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,340
approaching the ipv4 run out situation

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,890
and what it all meant and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,650
were doing and living inside a vendor

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,480
you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you kind of see a different</font>

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,519
perspective and so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this stuff</font>

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,989
kind of came together and Anna and these

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,120
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just what kind of my observations</font>

16
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,480
I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't make this stuff up</font>

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,250
I just observe it and so let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,440
this goes in and hopefully I'll have

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,050
some time to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> you or what people are</font>

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,099
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this but I just called</font>

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of the world as we know it</font>

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,989
because my friend Hank Kilmer had our am

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,879
calm and so everything's REM with Hank

24
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">mony they wanted it he didn't sell it</font>

25
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:01,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so this is the new internet</font>

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,120
architecture really so here's my agenda

27
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,650
on this okay so what's the problem and

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,658
what's it all about and then what is the

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,670
new architecture in which world is it

30
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,380
that's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I have</font>

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,060
a little bit of crystal ball stuff and

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,699
then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is next and then</font>

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,390
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Q&A a little bit so or</font>

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:23,070
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop me if you want to so before we</font>

35
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,020
dive into all of this you know you know

36
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,089
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you know there's this certain</font>

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,460
amount of grim reaper stuff in here and

38
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,560
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this guy actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has not</font>

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,789
fallen notwithstanding reports to the

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,220
contrary but if as my friend John Doyle

41
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,650
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caltech said Foreman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Abel's function</font>

42
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,360
and so you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

43
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,360
we're building and what functionality

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,740
were going to get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so what's</font>

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,689
the problem so the and this was my

46
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,220
observation from the last nanog into la

47
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,929
nanog which was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,908
by the way if you if you weren't there

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,509
it was really great watch it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

50
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,189
online anyway so the data plane the

51
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,799
internet data planes kind of under

52
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,990
attack right now not not concerted

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,629
attack like you would think as a Doss or

54
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,220
something like that but basically

55
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:13,290
intellectual attack due to the I panic

56
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,980
there's just widespread panic out there

57
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,929
to the ipv4 run out when i wrote this

58
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,640
there were maybe 30 / h left<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

59
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,370
know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact number is but I what</font>

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,578
is it 25 mark do you know some 25 or

61
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that 28</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2528</font>

62
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:33,540
whatever its order of 30 in the free

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,189
pool<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack the whole dual stack</font>

64
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,179
thing seems to have been abandoned<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

65
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">tuck a little bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

66
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,359
we'll see we'll see why I'm saying that

67
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a second and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's all these</font>

68
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:47,760
varieties of that and things that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

69
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,328
considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nats or beyond nat are being</font>

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,950
proposed by kind of smart people or

71
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:54,989
maybe the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're proposing</font>

72
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,089
that is an oxymoron<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

73
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">know something but you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who I</font>

74
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,459
thought were smart and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

75
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,138
the control planes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and under under some</font>

76
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,669
duress now this is a you know huge

77
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,109
controversy about you know whether or

78
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">not we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can build a giant route or do we</font>

79
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:11,790
need a giant<font color="#CCCCCC"> route or whatever but there</font>

80
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,290
are operational practices and economic

81
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,720
concerns that are putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress on the</font>

82
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,929
control plane how about it is you can

83
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,400
you know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate that but even</font>

84
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that we haven't seen the widespread</font>

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,650
adoption of ipv6 yet if that's too

86
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,930
indeed to happen and then we have this

87
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,959
rir thing where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's basically</font>

88
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,780
the Vince Fuller's term for this is pi/4

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,669
all allocation strategy so it really

90
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically means that the control planes</font>

91
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:42,120
in for some more rate times state

92
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:46,709
behavior in the future if ipv6 really

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,329
happens and in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all of this</font>

94
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,220
stuff the aggregation is on the rise and

95
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was just talking about 20 k about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

96
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,609
study has a real nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> study on this and</font>

97
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,359
there's all kinds of reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this as</font>

98
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,919
we all know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's this other</font>

99
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:02,370
thing out there right what about the

100
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">gray black market for trading ipv4</font>

101
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,659
addresses what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what's that</font>

102
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,430
going to do well when I wrote this when

103
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">I sent this to these guys last week or</font>

104
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,500
week and<font color="#E5E5E5"> half ago or whatever it was it</font>

105
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,570
was sort of like hypothetical well you

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,970
know Aaron policy 2002 what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

107
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,219
2008 s6 and the similar policy it right

108
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,100
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of turning white as</font>

109
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:29,250
we as we're standing here

110
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,600
oops and you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I just</font>

111
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to say that if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at this</font>

112
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,570
this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of gives you this kind of</font>

113
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,100
gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of concern about</font>

114
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole consensus-based self</font>

115
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,430
governance model that's been so great to

116
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,409
the internet because of all of a sudden

117
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that gets taken away at least in the</font>

118
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,070
address allocation piece of it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

119
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,560
actually living out in a market

120
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,169
mechanism what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that say I we need</font>

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,550
to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that a little bit and</font>

122
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:53,880
I'll just note on the control plane to

123
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,889
finish up this a little bit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the</font>

124
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,690
ipv6 designers as far as i can tell i

125
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,330
wasn't there some of some of you I know

126
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,910
where they're never really successfully

127
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,909
dealt or tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal or whatever with</font>

128
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:11,040
the control plane so that's just hanging

129
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,890
out there so it's a concern here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

130
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,810
assertion and that there's a lack

131
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,849
there's right now because of this panic

132
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,680
based response that we're seeing there's

133
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,630
really a lack of recent approach to the

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,979
ipv4 run out problems so this is the

135
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,930
data playing problem i'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

136
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,849
and the growth of routing state in the

137
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,470
control plane and in some ways their

138
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,850
life threatening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet the ND</font>

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,360
the end and idea is so powerful and

143
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,710
that's what's at stake but um in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,110
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i kind of really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

145
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,880
the data data plane because you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

146
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">beaten the control plane to death and</font>

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,570
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it on the our gmail and</font>

148
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,400
less than every other place it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

149
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,830
it's almost too much to even talk about

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,570
so the panic dejour really is that

151
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,890
what's going on in the data plane die

152
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,200
for you before run out and what it means

153
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,240
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about but</font>

154
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">i just want to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very brief idea of</font>

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,289
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in the control plane</font>

156
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,990
first so what's the issue there I think

157
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,280
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love this graph right</font>

158
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,289
during that during that time I was on

159
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,940
the IAB we did dated I mean we were

160
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:13,890
intellectuals it was unbelievable we

161
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,810
debated what curve best fit this for

162
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,229
hours and weeks and months you know and

163
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,970
I kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> on saying well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

164
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">really care of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its super linear linear</font>

165
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,500
or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's up and to the</font>

166
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,000
right that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> he got it no u no u</font>

167
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,440
infinity any other curve you went on

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,020
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's up and to the right right</font>

169
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,030
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> well maybe maybe there's a I don't</font>

170
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,859
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you see the pointer here</font>

171
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,840
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys see that well right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

172
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,590
was that tech crash right or the tech

173
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,659
bubble in

174
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">motion right and for you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

175
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,170
little bit it wasn't up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but</font>

176
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,430
you know you get the picture and and you

177
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,900
certainly get the picture when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look</font>

178
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,700
at how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> space you have left on your</font>

179
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,340
router and all that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> rib</font>

180
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,500
fib and all of that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so I</font>

181
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,119
really thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a really an</font>

182
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,390
academic exercise up and to the right

183
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's all you got to know so the whole</font>

184
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,810
solution to this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's been</font>

185
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,210
the holy grail of all of this is this

186
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,250
locator<font color="#CCCCCC"> IV split stuff and it basically</font>

187
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,109
changes the semantics of the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

188
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,570
and the theory behind it is that you

189
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,060
can't do good aggregation with IP

190
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,940
addresses because the number spaces that

191
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,050
you need for aggregating in the core are

192
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,570
different than the ones that you need

193
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,640
for identifying a host and the IP

194
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">address is trying to play both so it</font>

195
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,870
doesn't serve either one very well and

196
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,130
so kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is if you had ipv6</font>

197
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,470
what you could do is you got a lot of

198
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:32,880
bits right so you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the red</font>

199
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,410
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it be the the locator piece of</font>

200
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,380
it the routing piece of it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the green</font>

201
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,550
part BB identifier a piece of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

202
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">know maybe we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

203
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,460
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with ipv4 obviously</font>

204
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,600
because in yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and in ipv4 you</font>

205
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,010
don't have enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's right so what</font>

206
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,260
people are talking about doing as well

207
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,570
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in location what if</font>

208
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,030
we just use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a location routing</font>

209
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,469
thing to route around on and then we

210
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,299
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> slapped another header on and we'll</font>

211
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,670
call that or will slap the other header

212
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,500
on the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll call that on the</font>

213
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,120
identifier so we get some more bits by

214
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,890
just encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> another great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,170
about the IP thing right you just

216
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,800
encapsulate it cursors em to you but you

217
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:13,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">can still do it okay so how you scale</font>

218
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,590
the control plane tons intensive

219
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,570
solutions and they're all almost all

220
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,890
with the notable exception of what these

221
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,180
guy I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if you ever heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

222
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,680
this but there's a whole intellectual

223
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,810
group of people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font>

224
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,390
called compact routing and they claim

225
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,610
that scales and it's not based on

226
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,250
locator ID split everything else is it's

227
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,320
the Grail it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what we have</font>

228
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,850
intellectually around this we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

229
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">any other we don't have any other ideas</font>

230
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,950
right now and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if people</font>

231
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">know no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chiappa but he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the Guru</font>

232
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this and he was around back in the</font>

233
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,650
90s when this is going on here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

234
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,330
pointer to his page he's kind of

235
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,949
reemerged recently to give us some

236
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,220
wisdom on what he thinks on all of these

237
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,620
about all of these things but end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

238
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,210
day you got a blunt instrument that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

239
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,340
know you want to scalar out the control

240
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,920
plane one instrument you got it you got

241
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be topological aggregation that's all</font>

242
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,620
we got so here's some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

243
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">holy grail 61 router something that's</font>

244
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,490
been invented I mean there's a you know

245
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,860
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rrg list if you have a high</font>

247
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">kinds of this stuff yeah okay I said</font>

248
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,900
that none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things all of these</font>

249
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are all of these things are just</font>

250
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,400
kind of you know paper you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF think so they're paper stuff but</font>

252
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to implement</font>

253
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,050
Lisp and we've been trying to deploy it

254
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,520
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can learn some lessons and we've</font>

255
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned a ton of stuff but none of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

256
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,400
other stuff is gone and I would really

257
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody go off and</font>

258
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,480
implement this stuff so we could learn

259
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,000
whether it works what its properties are

260
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,230
and stuff like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

261
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,110
learn a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about less flick</font>

262
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:49,530
on WWE for net or if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> six in here</font>

263
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,680
you can look at ww list net dozer not

264
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:56,010
there as you might imagine list net was

265
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,089
taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the thing</font>

266
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about with just</font>

267
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,080
the data plane okay so what was our plan

268
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,040
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to scale the data plane</font>

269
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,360
right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know we want the</font>

270
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet to grow and somehow we got a</font>

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,910
scale the data plane so we had this idea

272
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:11,430
ipv6 good idea lots of bits so how to

273
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,110
get there<font color="#CCCCCC"> from here well we had dual</font>

274
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,479
stack right I mean does everybody know

275
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,490
what dual stack may he just run ipv4 and

276
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,010
ipv6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and somehow magically</font>

277
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,840
one goes away at some point right so we

278
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,880
had dual stack it was a great idea just

279
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,680
put to just put two IP snacks in your

280
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,570
box in your router and whatever great

281
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea so we had dual stack and we also</font>

282
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,210
have dual stuck you know and we had dual

283
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:35,100
stack I mean we didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any another</font>

284
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:36,390
plan right this was the plan well you

285
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,030
know there's it's an inherently flawed

286
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:42,510
idea right I mean unfortunately because

287
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,579
really unfortunately because well how's

288
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">it work right I stick I stick cuate</font>

289
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,840
records in the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the in the</font>

290
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,280
dns and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can signal let my host you</font>

291
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,230
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i look up your address and i can</font>

292
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,060
signal to you yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an interface</font>

293
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,120
it's like ub6 capable once you use that

294
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,030
the unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it doesn't tell</font>

295
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,370
me anything about the data path so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

296
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that can</font>

297
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,290
due to me right i mean if especially if

298
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,330
i'm taking calls you know you know in

299
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the call center about that about you</font>

300
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,580
know my customers you know consider what

301
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,080
vista was doing right what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would do</font>

302
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,029
was it would use the claudia record of

303
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,490
it was there after timeout because there

304
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,380
was no path<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever and then you</font>

305
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,760
know the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> would ring and you lose</font>

306
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,490
the revenue for the customer for the

307
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,050
lifetime of a customer and whatever so

308
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,490
here's a beautiful graph by Jeff Houston

309
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> describes what was supposed to</font>

310
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:33,130
happen so the ipv4 pool size is crashing

311
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,080
away the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is growing but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

312
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,970
this great<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology called ipv6 and if</font>

313
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,529
we ran the stool stack thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

314
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,339
there'd be this crossover point right

315
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:43,900
here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a sudden ipv4</font>

316
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:45,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just start crashing the way and</font>

317
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">people just turn it off and all of a</font>

318
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,880
sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything would be ipv6 right I</font>

319
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,400
mean it's a perfect idea right if it had

320
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">work what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really happened was another</font>

321
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,990
nice graph from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff internet kept</font>

322
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,790
growing ipv4 pool kept decreasing

323
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,880
continues to decrease and ipv6

324
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,260
deployment did nothing so now we're over

325
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,300
here I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you can really see</font>

326
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,279
this line but we're over here and so

327
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,160
there's this big gap right here and so

328
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,950
what do we do right we're kind of what

329
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,870
do we do so that's that's the panic

330
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,779
right the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this gap right here</font>

331
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:23,350
and we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them network to continue to</font>

332
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:25,029
grow obviously all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us did so what's</font>

333
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,250
the new data plane what are we going to

334
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,380
do about this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are still</font>

335
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,220
people are still talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about dual</font>

336
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,170
stack so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said earlier that it was</font>

337
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,420
effectively abandoned right dual stack

338
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,579
and if you read this document which was

339
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

340
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,800
people the I star people wrote as a

341
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,990
document for one interim meeting they

342
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,219
had if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> read that closely you'll find</font>

343
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,200
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're basically the</font>

344
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,560
conclusion is dual stack was a great

345
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,300
idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't work and you know if</font>

346
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,699
you couple that with what what's called

347
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,839
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that document disappointing ipv6</font>

348
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,520
uptake so what's what's happening what's

349
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's out there so now now I'm</font>

350
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,000
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vendor I'm listening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to what</font>

351
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,439
customers are saying I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at with</font>

352
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,560
people inside the vendor or trying to do

353
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,850
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm seeing</font>

354
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">Carrie great nap how many how many</font>

355
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,100
people have heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this how people</font>

356
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,779
have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this a month ago yeah well</font>

357
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody knows what it is</font>

358
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and so basically what is it it's a</font>

359
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,260
giant<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of big iron right and it's</font>

360
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,000
real hot and takes a lot of power it's

361
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,810
got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of state in it and it's not</font>

362
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,060
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not it's not PT because</font>

363
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">protocol translation right because</font>

364
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">dual-stack didn't work so how am I going</font>

365
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,649
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world if I</font>

366
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:42,160
have v6 or before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> either side I need</font>

367
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,750
NAT PT protocol translation somewhere so

368
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,870
there's double or triple<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nats going on</font>

369
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,480
right there's this other idea called a

370
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,610
plus B address plus support it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

371
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,149
a crazy idea I thought but basically the

372
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:58,959
idea was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a consumer I</font>

373
00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:00,579
don't usually use 65,000 on TCP

374
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,469
connections so maybe I can steal some

375
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:05,979
bits from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the port and make a bigger</font>

376
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:08,769
address out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there's still stack</font>

377
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,130
light that comes down to see GN plus

378
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:18,190
some tunneling people have talked about

379
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 edge with ipv4 core 626 over 4 does</font>

380
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,040
that really work I mean is that useful

381
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,040
you know Metcalfe's law stuff like that

382
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,839
how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 google com and bitchiness</font>

383
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,630
why don't they put quad a records in

384
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,610
google com in the beginning well because

385
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">dual-stack didn't work it's the most</font>

386
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,510
obvious evidence that dual stack didn't

387
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,589
work now they're giving you this google

388
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:40,449
or IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google over ipv6 which is sort of</font>

389
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:42,130
a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying i'll give you a dns view</font>

390
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:44,589
but you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibility if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

391
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:48,720
have a path go Joe uh Google will serve

392
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,720
you quad a records if you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

393
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,820
destination that

394
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,860
deemed as v6k yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google over</font>

395
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,080
ipv6 and that's just saying you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

396
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,460
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a view and that view</font>

397
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,290
is saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys stick it's your</font>

398
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility now right but I mean</font>

399
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,630
they're engaged in a magic dns load

400
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,760
balancing exercise and which records

401
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,160
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you is a property of where you</font>

402
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,430
come from and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doesn't</font>

403
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,600
change whether you're on before or v6

404
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:19,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well John hey Dave so I don't know</font>

405
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">if if but you can say that dual stack is</font>

406
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,770
effectively been hemming<font color="#CCCCCC"> breather he's</font>

407
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,000
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what I got going on yeah</font>

408
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,410
yeah yeah people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing it i'm not</font>

409
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,720
saying people are doing it I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

410
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that from the perspective of</font>

411
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,770
what's being deployed right now and how

412
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are trying to solve this problem</font>

413
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:42,610
and what's been written in the IETF you

414
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:46,010
know it functionally so<font color="#E5E5E5"> well take enough</font>

415
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:50,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so can you do ipv4 edge with ipv6</font>

416
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:53,030
core 6 6 44 4 4 / 6 well if you could do

417
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you could just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do 66 over six so</font>

418
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,360
you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ipv6 core which which</font>

419
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is part of problem was part of the</font>

420
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,200
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think it must be the case</font>

421
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,780
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> designer is a dual stack</font>

422
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,970
thought that oh well I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ipv6</font>

423
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,150
core and I'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transit this</font>

424
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,760
stuff does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work well not really now</font>

425
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:15,140
you've seen stuff like NAT 66 emerged

426
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is 626 nap and what</font>

427
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,400
happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Oh ipv6 is great we</font>

428
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:23,330
don't need not anymore well now we have

429
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:28,579
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nats 66 and I didn't say 666 which</font>

430
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:32,960
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just 6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 26 / 6 I mean it goes on okay</font>

431
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:35,620
it goes on what can I say this is

432
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,150
another just a data point for you all um

433
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,780
the behave working group in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IHF is</font>

434
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:44,930
now kind of found the role that they are

435
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,699
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sort of standardizing</font>

436
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,989
the nap behavior so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i HAF never</font>

437
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,440
standardise an app which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font>

438
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,150
reason it's difficult well the behave

439
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,730
working group met seven times at the

440
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,800
last I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two interims that vets</font>

441
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,550
tells you something I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never heard of a</font>

442
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,790
working group meeting seven times in IHF

443
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,079
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what does it all mean</font>

444
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,440
this carrier-grade NAT stuff's going to

445
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,169
get deployed so you know there's a

446
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,310
synergy right the synergy is the synergy

447
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,930
is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you can have a bad</font>

448
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,208
synergy I think synergy means good

449
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:20,990
combination of things or something but

450
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:24,230
the synergy is it's it's big iron right

451
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:27,200
so vendors like to make big iron and and

452
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,480
if you are a service provider and you

453
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,100
need IP address space it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

454
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,930
property right you can unilaterally<font color="#E5E5E5"> de</font>

455
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,360
play it and it frees you up from the ir

456
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,640
a-- from any relationship with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> irr</font>

457
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,219
because now you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

458
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,380
manufacturing or multiplexing more

459
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,720
globally unique addresses on one single

460
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,180
on a bunch of different dresses so

461
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,710
there's kind of a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know everybody's</font>

462
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,360
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of liking it the only people who</font>

463
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,320
aren't liking it are the ops people who

464
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,570
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to actually run this</font>

465
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,020
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably some of the people</font>

466
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:59,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">who you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the consumers of</font>

467
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,590
consumer connectivity that that might

468
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,649
realize that there's implications to

469
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,030
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so carrier-grade NAT it's</font>

470
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,280
going to it's in your future<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

471
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">dual-stack light yeah it's going to be</font>

472
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,670
standardized to because it was just

473
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,950
recently added to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software working</font>

474
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,710
group as a charter items so you're going

475
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get a standard that's a dual stack</font>

476
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,730
light and you know vendors are going to

477
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,770
go implemented if somebody check sit on

478
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,740
an RFP so that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

479
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,480
future I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that a plus if he</font>

480
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,280
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pick it was a plus fee was</font>

481
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,270
all about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hate NAT and so</font>

482
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,040
we're going to be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

483
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,450
and so I thought it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be picked up</font>

484
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,700
but there was some indication at the

485
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,030
last IETF that is such a wacky idea that

486
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,590
maybe people are going to give up on it

487
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,330
there's some potential for ipv6 to be

488
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:44,929
confined to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge for all the reasons</font>

489
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,429
for just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and you know I</font>

490
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,230
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder would this be fatal for</font>

491
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:52,940
ipv6 could it survive as an edge

492
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:55,580
technology and you know if you have an

493
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,050
ipv6 edge with an ipv4 core does it

494
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,909
really solve a problem i'm not sure what

495
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,100
problem it says you know it's still I

496
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">still got who who do I talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

497
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,639
Metcalfe's law or whatever and then

498
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,380
there's all the second system syndrome

499
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,660
stuff with ipv6 that you know you're

500
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,730
kind of little worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so do we</font>

501
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:15,800
get left with<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so live with it you</font>

502
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,990
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're gonna you're going to see it</font>

503
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,780
now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the question I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have for</font>

504
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,580
everybody right here so if I have CGN if

505
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,649
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technology that says to you</font>

506
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,689
guys hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you don't need to</font>

507
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">go and get more addresses you don't need</font>

508
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to coordinate with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an rirs you don't</font>

509
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,740
need to coordinate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with anybody I'll</font>

510
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,630
just give you a big piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> iron and</font>

511
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,950
you're done right mod some stuff we'll

512
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,350
just talk about what does that mean for

513
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 we've already had so much</font>

514
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,490
difficulty getting it deployed now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

515
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,750
giving you another technology we're

516
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,710
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> you another technology well yeah</font>

517
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,620
now we're giving you<font color="#E5E5E5"> another technology</font>

518
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,000
just says you don't need ipv6 what's

519
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,310
going on I mean what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen</font>

520
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,720
so you know you I'll just give you a

521
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,889
view from inside event or vendor goes

522
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,780
hey we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do everything you</font>

523
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,990
know we did ospf we did is I us we do

524
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything right well the ospf and is is</font>

525
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,420
for someone independent right you know

526
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,340
you want a<font color="#CCCCCC"> link state routing protocol</font>

527
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,950
you take their when you like right here

528
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,040
these things interact strongly and so

529
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,570
the question is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy cgm what</font>

530
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,020
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to ipv6 they're not</font>

531
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:20,480
independent is that is the issue so what

532
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,360
does it all mean well it means<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

533
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,980
escalating costs for everyone right at

534
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,929
the very least the carrier is now going

535
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know service providers now going</font>

536
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,600
to bear a lot of support and

537
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,730
customization costs on poor customer

538
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,139
basis because you know if you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

539
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,940
look at this carrier-grade NAT thing

540
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,590
closely what you find out is that it

541
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,730
replicates that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got mine at a</font>

542
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,050
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind a little nick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gear in that</font>

543
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,760
box on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other side of my cable modem</font>

544
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,200
right there's a bunch of stayed in there

545
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,090
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the port mapping senal I stuff</font>

546
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,950
that stuff goes and gets replicated back

547
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,179
out in the carrier-grade NAT so now

548
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,350
somebody's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to manage that</font>

549
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">state escalating complexity and</font>

550
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,290
applications and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

551
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,439
more fragile right and reduce

552
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,760
flexibility increase risk of failure all

553
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,260
this stuff goes along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with having a</font>

554
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of states scattered around and</font>

555
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,850
then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it end</font>

556
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,470
end is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be extremely fragile in</font>

557
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,439
this environment if it's at if it works

558
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,670
at all John how about them I mean just

559
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to point out the obvious what about the</font>

560
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:16,430
impact is subscribe I mean haven't

561
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,659
gotten there yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hey look you know</font>

562
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:23,129
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like the Grim Reaper man</font>

563
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:26,159
I know I'm with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

564
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:27,509
hot topic right so yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

565
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,190
know like i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not making this up</font>

566
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">i just these are just my observations or</font>

567
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,369
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh-uh so van you</font>

568
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:36,869
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody gets up at they had this</font>

569
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:38,249
really interesting session at that last

570
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,899
night on if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't there it's</font>

571
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:42,059
called what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> John do and that the</font>

572
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:44,279
hypothesis was you know pastel was the

573
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,229
you know guru of address at every kind

574
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,330
of number and address space allocation

575
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:49,619
and what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> if he done and somebody</font>

576
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,269
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> up at the end of this and said well</font>

577
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,309
what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with NAT what's the</font>

578
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,049
problem and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what man said i</font>

579
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:56,999
looked up because he mentioned my name

580
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,399
that's that's why I know it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hagan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hi</font>

581
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:01,399
suck man<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I did what I did I</font>

582
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:04,678
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was in trouble or something</font>

583
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:06,090
so he goes not couples he go this is

584
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,379
what he said to this guy was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

585
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,599
question you know it's like you get it

586
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:11,820
it's a reasonable question he said not

587
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,129
couples the inside address and port to

588
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,840
the outside address important in many to

589
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:18,689
one relationship right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that</font>

590
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he goes well this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of</font>

591
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,769
coupling that causes complexity and

592
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:24,090
hence fragility right and then he

593
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:28,440
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this but he talked</font>

594
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:29,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this RFC 34 34 39 that I wrote it</font>

595
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,169
was a it was actually an internal

596
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,039
document i wrote when I was at sprint

597
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,389
because I couldn't believe how

598
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,099
complicated the network was that they

599
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:38,428
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> building and I was trying to figure</font>

600
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">out why and then Randy had randy was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

601
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:41,460
AT&T at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time and I was kind of</font>

602
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,289
sharing this with him and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't</font>

603
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,539
use an internal sprint document at AT&T

604
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:50,129
surprisingly and so we turned it into an

605
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:51,960
RFC um there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing going on</font>

606
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:54,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">here this this this is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> induce</font>

607
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,970
some kind of unwanted structure or well

608
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:58,859
maybe depends on who you are it it will

609
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,710
induce a structure on the SP industry

610
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,389
and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same way that you</font>

611
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,769
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> giant routing tables induces</font>

612
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:07,949
structure if you have to have a giant

613
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,690
router just to play on the DFC that's

614
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,119
going to limit who and what kind of

615
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,279
people play right so if you now have

616
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:18,299
another device that's a giant expensive

617
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:21,029
hot power sucking alien device that you

618
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:22,320
have to have to play that's going to

619
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,029
induce the structure on the industry

620
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,389
have we thought about it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

621
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,879
so

622
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:29,678
the other question is okay so maybe this

623
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:31,389
is all fine maybe it's not all fine it

624
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,519
doesn't seem so fine to me but I mean

625
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:35,258
some people think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then if</font>

626
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,359
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have a solution to the you</font>

627
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,190
know to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that I'm kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

628
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,349
trying to outline here where will we

629
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,690
look for solutions that's a meta problem

630
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:45,428
on top of all of this and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

631
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,739
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf for the r IG have you</font>

632
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:49,269
noticed the last 20 years you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

633
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:51,190
mean this is this stuff have been around

634
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">for 20 years and we're we're going</font>

635
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:57,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">backwards not forwards right now so I'm</font>

636
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:59,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure so here's my you know picture</font>

637
00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:01,389
worth a thousand words um you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

638
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,159
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should stop the train or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

639
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:04,658
get some tracks before you run off them

640
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,169
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right metaphor is but</font>

641
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:13,209
wow it's a train wreck out there so

642
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:15,339
what's next well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the sad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

643
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:17,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">is if this happens for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ESPYs the</font>

644
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:19,208
Internet's just going to cost more to

645
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:21,849
operate in to deploy I mean if these

646
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:23,499
large state<font color="#CCCCCC"> bearing devices and they're</font>

647
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:25,539
big these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be big</font>

648
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:28,379
just going to you know I've heard

649
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:30,729
numbers like million subscribers per CGN

650
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:33,218
can if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can imagine the amount of</font>

651
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:35,649
state that's going to be in that for

652
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:37,959
users so I think John asks us for users

653
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:40,119
the internet is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be way less</font>

654
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:41,559
reliable and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive well the</font>

655
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:44,529
cost of running that's going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

656
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,609
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> transferred to somebody and it's</font>

657
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:47,469
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be less reliable because</font>

658
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:50,049
there's more state more complexity and

659
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:53,979
all of that stuff more balkanized

660
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:55,450
because wow you know what cgms auto auto

661
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:56,409
walled garden you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like you</font>

662
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,239
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry about whether or not</font>

663
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:59,679
I'm gonna rate limit bad traffic it just

664
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:01,839
doesn't work anymore so<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets rate</font>

665
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,129
limited 20 it's really nice not only

666
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,719
that yes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know don't worry about</font>

667
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:06,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">BitTorrent it doesn't work and you know</font>

668
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:08,829
net neutrality by the way you can't

669
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:10,359
implement it anymore right so look at

670
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:16,899
the number of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing songs</font>

671
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:19,449
it's great so uh so we're all out here

672
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:21,189
debating you know you get out you know

673
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,450
there's people who think ipv6 is the

674
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,070
answer there's people who think it will

675
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the answer you know the anti</font>

676
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:29,320
ipv6 person Vince fuller whoever never

677
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:32,679
can't be some people are out there

678
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,769
evangelizing the question is ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

679
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,929
ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> no trains left on that too this is</font>

680
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question oh yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i have this</font>

681
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,580
dude

682
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,320
you know what's the value proposition

683
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,389
what it you know people are going oh

684
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,158
what's the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> prophecies for ipv6</font>

685
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,710
what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> men calf's law what's all</font>

686
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,770
this stuff it's not the problem anymore

687
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,720
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem in my mind how do we</font>

688
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,490
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this place where we're going to</font>

689
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,950
wind up everything's heavily now did not

690
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">pee pee everywhere that's the world all</font>

691
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,980
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden we got to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world how do</font>

692
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:04,629
we get from there back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an internet</font>

693
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,100
that's more like the one we that we know

694
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,990
and love the innovation engine the

695
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-to-end internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well how do we solve</font>

696
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:12,789
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem because that's the real</font>

697
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,570
problem now not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know ipv6 or ipv4</font>

698
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:19,960
that that's in the past one way is not

699
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:23,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go there yeah but as you know i think</font>

700
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:27,640
it's locked you know I I don't know I

701
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,899
think it's inevitable at this point so

702
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,909
there's more questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and answers in</font>

703
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:33,668
this but job even if it's inevitable

704
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:35,830
isn't our job to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that if it</font>

705
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:37,740
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> we limit the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of time like</font>

706
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,149
instead of making it forever technology

707
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,130
if we need a crutch to get from point A

708
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:43,479
to point B maybe see jen's are the way

709
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,029
to go right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think anybody</font>

710
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,080
here is really in love with the idea I

711
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,720
don't know are there any vendors out

712
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,309
there I mean come on you know there are

713
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in love with the idea yeah but do</font>

714
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,389
you mean not me but and not you but you

715
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,490
put you might love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but if</font>

716
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,320
it adversity packs a subscriber

717
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,610
experience then it just there's a

718
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,379
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause-and-effect there right</font>

719
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:06,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah I'm with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you man I mean I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

720
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,480
I'm you know don't shoot the<font color="#CCCCCC"> messenger</font>

721
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:27,399
sorry excuse me I can't hear you could

722
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:35,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">you say your name to I'm sorry that's</font>

723
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:35,758
the question I think

724
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,960
so

725
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,990
two

726
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,480
yeah could be well you know one of the

727
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,799
things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

728
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,539
environment that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> carry a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great nap</font>

729
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,400
thing what's going to happen is the web

730
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:08,500
will probably still work right for most

731
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">parts right so the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how many</font>

732
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,429
you know I my SP and all of my

733
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">subscribers are just basically surfing</font>

734
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:16,210
the web they probably wouldn't even

735
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,340
notice right so am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i damaged in that way</font>

736
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,970
well the people who are the innovators

737
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:24,220
are but maybe not that you know and

738
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:27,549
that's the damage that that's really

739
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,990
being done by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this that's really this</font>

740
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:30,908
whole thing is about more questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

741
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,530
answers right so I was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

742
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">out well what would I do if I was thus</font>

743
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:37,270
our first thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is I'd really I'd</font>

744
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,129
really and this kinda goes to John's

745
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,770
thing is what can we do to you know

746
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:44,409
effect to mitigate the effect of all of

747
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,270
this you know if it if if indeed you

748
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:49,030
know the crystal ball is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as Claudius</font>

749
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,830
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems and you know how do you I</font>

750
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,210
mean how will we do this because one

751
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,980
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to mention John is that</font>

752
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,840
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has this nasty</font>

753
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,480
habit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> once something used to play</font>

754
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,860
it's pretty hard to dislodge it you know

755
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,240
I mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is we need some serious</font>

756
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,860
research into you know what kind of

757
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet scale data and control planes</font>

758
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,229
will work you know we're really you know

759
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,789
we work on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are gee I don't know</font>

760
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,610
it's been a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit disappointing i</font>

761
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:16,780
don't think it's been as fast or nimble

762
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,639
as i would have liked it to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

763
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,379
but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's aspect of the process</font>

764
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,940
and we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're trying</font>

765
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:26,200
different things but we need larger

766
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:28,150
scale larger scale efforts and you know

767
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,780
it's a multidisciplinary thing too<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

768
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:33,820
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now on the RG list there's a</font>

769
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,320
there's a discussion going on about you

770
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,240
know the economics of different kinds of

771
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,549
you know mapping systems whatever those

772
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,710
are and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've done this before</font>

773
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:44,190
in the internet space dns and this sort

774
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,240
of stuff but we need we need to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

775
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,070
multidisciplinary approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

776
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,289
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just so many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> variables</font>

777
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,210
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many factors economic technology</font>

778
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:55,000
sociological all of this kind of stuff

779
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we need you know and it's not going</font>

780
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,169
to happen in a casual manner so some we

781
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:04,590
need to we need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it as a</font>

782
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:04,590
community that's what I got

783
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:16,810
anybody else going bill thanks for

784
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">bringing this up it just strikes me that</font>

785
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:23,090
we consistently go down the path of

786
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,399
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> resistance so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever is easiest</font>

787
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,379
to do we tend to do that and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended</font>

788
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,840
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a dead easy thing to do</font>

789
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,910
right you pop a box and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden</font>

790
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these machines at your home</font>

791
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,230
connected up over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single IP great it</font>

792
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,270
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you keep on going</font>

793
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:42,440
that direction it's going to take a

794
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:44,840
mighty mighty pain point in order to get

795
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,790
rid of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just large that technology a</font>

796
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,679
pain point being that well it just

797
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,210
doesn't work anymore right and maybe

798
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,340
that point something new something

799
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,890
different it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to draw</font>

800
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,720
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in doc I'll be sweet enough to</font>

801
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">make them want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do yes maybe a little</font>

802
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,750
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the old thing that doesn't quite</font>

803
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,580
work but also sign up to this new thing

804
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,700
have you considered that trajectory of

805
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:07,669
future yeah I um I actually think that's

806
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,430
how it's gonna unwind um basically stuff

807
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,290
will stop working and somebody will come

808
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,110
along and they'll you know they'll put

809
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,330
up what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv 70 or whatever or</font>

810
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,949
whatever it is and they'll start

811
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,080
offering services that start looking

812
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the internet does now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and people go</font>

813
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,560
hey that's pretty cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't we do that</font>

814
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:28,730
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know so I agree with</font>

815
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:32,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">you yeah that would be worse but yeah</font>

816
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:34,610
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Braden Ross with Zach I'm just as</font>

817
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,220
a little bit of support i think for what

818
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:39,709
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying we work with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

819
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,960
operators in the developing<font color="#CCCCCC"> world so the</font>

820
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,570
information has not initially gotten to

821
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,790
them maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> as clearly as your typical</font>

822
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:50,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">nanog attendee and I find extremely</font>

823
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:52,040
often finding myself explaining why they

824
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nat their entire</font>

825
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,730
network and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking before</font>

826
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,980
today why they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to nap</font>

827
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,890
their entire network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes addresses</font>

828
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,050
are still available even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though there's</font>

829
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,670
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've done apparently a really</font>

830
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,440
great job of making them all believe

831
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are no more be 4i addresses</font>

832
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,940
already and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume you have to</font>

833
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,669
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your entire operators network</font>

834
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,379
that like the whole core yeah so I'm

835
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:18,750
sure there's a run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too but</font>

836
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:21,840
yeah it's a something I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been dealing</font>

837
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,879
with a lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year yeah yeah</font>

838
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,620
well so maybe the answer is you know

839
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:27,779
maybe one of the answers to this is well

840
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,969
there's going to be a market for ipv4

841
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,169
and you know you have enough money you

842
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,940
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably get something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right but</font>

843
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:34,289
that'll host the control plane so you

844
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,600
know because people will d aggregate

845
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:38,399
then and you know that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

846
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,969
answer right I mean we need something

847
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">more architectural then as bill is</font>

848
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:46,169
pointing out then the path of least

849
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">resistance let me go to John and then</font>

850
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:51,179
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be my last one day sorry to know</font>

851
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,549
there's no quota so the only thing that

852
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:55,440
I'm you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that because we all care</font>

853
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:57,389
the near and dear in turn ends near and

854
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,340
dear to all of us right so in my mind to

855
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:02,519
kind of help minimize some of the pain

856
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,590
that we're we're kind of saying out loud

857
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,450
we think is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming our way</font>

858
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,580
not just a future it seems to be one of

859
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,679
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is you know</font>

860
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,789
particularly folks miss room is to start

861
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing the things that need to happen to</font>

862
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:18,690
encourage v6 right you know if you have

863
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,210
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own content</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> services making those</font>

864
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,370
available right like we do make those

865
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,049
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock 36 right start working</font>

866
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,379
started working stir because there's

867
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:31,559
still a painful lack of that in you know

868
00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:34,500
the big I<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet right yeah I gotta I</font>

869
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,450
gotta I gotta just<font color="#CCCCCC"> give one I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

870
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,860
job but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just somebody from comcast I</font>

871
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,480
forgot who it was but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy who was</font>

872
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,008
you were sitting there we were sitting

873
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,139
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the guy</font>

874
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:44,549
says to me he turned to me and I'm sorry

875
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:46,678
I forgot his<font color="#E5E5E5"> name but he turns mean he</font>

876
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:48,090
says well you know I'm a provisioning

877
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,639
engineer I sit around all day and what I

878
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,080
do is I provision cmcs is right what he

879
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:54,928
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and he goes have you ever</font>

880
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,720
noticed that there's no letters and no

881
00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:00,149
colon on a numeric keyboard you know

882
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,679
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that level right even</font>

883
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:05,008
at that level the person has to change

884
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,409
their behavior to go to ipv6 you know

885
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:09,990
and when you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about from that level</font>

886
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:12,419
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend systems routing all of</font>

887
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:15,509
this stuff it's the distance is far and

888
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:17,489
part of the part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the thing that makes</font>

889
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,399
CGN kind of inevitable is that we don't

890
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:24,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">have enough time in theory to get that</font>

891
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,638
distance before ipv4 run out right I

892
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,639
mean

893
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">i I've run that race I can see the</font>

894
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,460
finish line right i mean i'm getting to

895
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:31,808
a place in not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future where i</font>

896
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,429
hope people to come here one day and

897
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:36,159
said hey you know what you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

898
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:37,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can check comcast net over IP 6 yep</font>

899
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now i know i know you're working</font>

900
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:43,509
hard yeah drop Joe what sizing one of

901
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:47,308
the other observations that goes along

902
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:50,379
with the discussion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> D aggregation is</font>

903
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:52,149
that property is inevitable as far as

904
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:54,848
I'm concerned I mean there's there's no

905
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,788
avoiding that regardless of what

906
00:34:54,849 --> 00:35:01,690
technology we<font color="#CCCCCC"> deploy and you know even</font>

907
00:34:57,789 --> 00:35:04,089
if it's v6 we get it there so I mean

908
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,910
that that also you know obviously drives

909
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:08,140
the consumption of other hot boxes in

910
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,990
the network that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all know and love</font>

911
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,808
but we already have a model for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

912
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:16,919
I mean what we do see now is you run out

913
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:20,589
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> before addresses well that's one</font>

914
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,140
that's one impediment to the growth of

915
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:25,240
the routing table and of course the<font color="#CCCCCC"> d</font>

916
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,890
aggregation one moves on from there so

917
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,589
right clearly we've got to be on

918
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">schedule if we can have half a million</font>

919
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:39,430
routes in our DFC table in a year so

920
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">right well suck Wests Tigers further you</font>

921
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,519
know I take a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of issue with</font>

922
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">your stating at some point in the future</font>

923
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:48,640
things are going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

924
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,410
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the point where you know v6</font>

925
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,440
is going to suddenly be deployed I

926
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,819
didn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I know you sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

927
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,160
alluded to the point that at some point

928
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:59,079
things will be fast but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't say to</font>

929
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,819
me I did let me let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me make a point I</font>

930
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,329
didn't say they be I did i explicitly

931
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:05,349
did not say they'd be fixed by b6

932
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:09,819
explicitly did not say that they're not

933
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:12,279
fair but my point is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't live in a</font>

934
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:15,910
world where it's black and white

935
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:19,690
unfortunately and to thee to the end

936
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:22,359
user my parents believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

937
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,290
internet is slow and if they have to go

938
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:25,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">through 15 different nap box</font>

939
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,190
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand that it's</font>

940
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,690
going from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know from one mechanism</font>

941
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,550
to another and it's possibly going

942
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,950
through multiple hops you know

943
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">carrier-grade</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not unfortunately it's</font>

944
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:39,379
still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work and I say</font>

945
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:41,570
unfortunately because there's very

946
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,760
little financial incentive to most

947
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,710
people to fix things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of in</font>

948
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey area you know things were</font>

949
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,340
broken hacks get deployed and they get

950
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,930
fixed unfortunately the hacks tend to

951
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,420
slow things down a little bit and that

952
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,919
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a hack and it works and</font>

953
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,460
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing that it works because</font>

954
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">it does fix things but you know we're</font>

955
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where</font>

956
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,529
unfortunately things are going to stop

957
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,900
working to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

958
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,450
be an incentive to fix it unfortunately

959
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,620
what we have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the right thing</font>

960
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if we had and there's there's</font>

961
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,710
enough people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room I know that</font>

962
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,930
are starting to do the right thing and

963
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,460
actually making an easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> employee and</font>

964
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,649
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the service end which is</font>

965
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,780
giving me a critical point and you know

966
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:22,130
deploying it and base operating systems

967
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,400
turned on and all those kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

968
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:28,430
that will actually make 626<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work in</font>

969
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,930
a positive fashion unfortunately the

970
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:32,810
financial incentive to do the right

971
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:35,419
thing is low because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

972
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">greyer not more black yeah that's that's</font>

973
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,150
kind of part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to drive that</font>

974
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,830
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying the whole problem is</font>

975
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,420
multidisciplinary right it's not just a

976
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,370
technology problem so your points

977
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,990
well-taken yeah yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support</font>

978
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,400
that again that's that's exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

979
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,140
run into is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like well we're</font>

980
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,940
gonna do nadam well why would you do

981
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,250
that well we can't get any addresses

982
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,780
well why wouldn't we do now so I try to

983
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,550
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> well there's these applications</font>

984
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,690
that are in den<font color="#CCCCCC"> and but nobody don't get</font>

985
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:00,080
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well can i surf the</font>

986
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:03,370
web yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay done right just void work</font>

987
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:07,940
well sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of we can kind of make it work</font>

988
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:09,680
does video work uh well yeah unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

989
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,120
want to like send your own video

990
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,410
directly to your neighbor<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well we'll</font>

991
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:16,069
never do that always good for the server

992
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:18,290
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you're breaking things but</font>

993
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,420
it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to explain to</font>

994
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:22,370
someone with a basic level of networking

995
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,230
knowledge but not that kind of insight

996
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,690
say well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want people</font>

997
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,880
who aren't networking people to have to

998
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,740
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though exactly exactly</font>

999
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,970
you know exact you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1000
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,859
have a technology where you have to be a

1001
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,169
rocket science scientists<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it and</font>

1002
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font>

1003
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,690
you know your grandma's not one then no

1004
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:42,960
Dino so we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really careful</font>

1005
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,700
when we say networks we know networks in

1006
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the class of boxes that are lakes this</font>

1007
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,799
netgear for a very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of</font>

1008
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,720
addresses in a home residence we have no

1009
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if that can work between two</font>

1010
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,750
service providers being an implementer

1011
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,750
and trying to get traceroute just one

1012
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,790
single very rudimentary application to

1013
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,650
work through net it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be huge</font>

1014
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,870
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> much intermediate state will</font>

1015
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:09,990
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done to get traceroute to</font>

1016
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:12,270
work through a gnat because I C&P does

1017
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,879
not return the entire packet back to you

1018
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,710
any tunneling that you do will lose the

1019
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,600
original source and trace route by

1020
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:20,850
itself will break let alone all the

1021
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,560
applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you alluded to yeah</font>

1022
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,670
let me just we gotta we gotta shut down

1023
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,720
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say one more thing on</font>

1024
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because somebody said something</font>

1025
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,799
about VoIP right<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1026
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,510
yeah we have this great these great

1027
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,340
technologies about a thousands of them a

1028
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:35,670
thousand of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them stun a nice turn all</font>

1029
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff firewall traversal junk um do</font>

1030
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:40,260
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all of the million</font>

1031
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,210
subscribers like saying John's network

1032
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,220
John's gonna want he has it now he has a

1033
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,540
carrier-grade NAT that's serving what

1034
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,310
million subscribers he's going to let

1035
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,410
people connect to that thing and stun

1036
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:51,450
ice turn to it I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know</font>

1037
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,100
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think that and even if he</font>

1038
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,279
did could you build an engine that would

1039
00:39:53,100 --> 00:40:01,009
scale to that I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so not right</font>

1040
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,010
now so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's all thanks</font>
