00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:24,900
we've done deployments now in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wanda here</font>

in the Dominican Republic and then a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,209
more rural places around the u.s. like

some areas south of George South Atlanta

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,730
in Georgia so I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of</font>

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,860
timely that since I was here and got

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,599
some good photos of our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,219
how it gets installed that it might be

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to share a little bit of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that with the nanog crowd and show you</font>

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,899
how these things work clearly the

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,719
some level of awareness of what those

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,010
networks might look like probably could

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,379
help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a little bit at least the</font>

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,378
how do you get internet here this is

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,289
country they have electricity so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font>

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,820
you build<font color="#CCCCCC"> these networks well first of</font>

45
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,469
all you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together basic design just</font>

46
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">like just like you would for any network</font>

47
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,679
in this case yeah like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said we're</font>

48
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,750
wireless there's no wires going up these

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,340
mountains so it's all got to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

50
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,009
hauled over wireless this is a pretty

<font color="#E5E5E5">simple network on the top right here you</font>

56
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,420
near that house I showed you from there

57
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,100
we're going to build that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of as a</font>

hub site to cover<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh there's all these</font>

59
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,880
little towns you see a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them here</font>

60
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,470
there's just our<font color="#CCCCCC"> very first phase but</font>

61
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,240
there's all these little towns spread

62
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,500
throughout these mountains that again

63
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
they have no electricity they have no

64
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,590
existing phone service there's no cell

65
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,830
signal there either once you get over

66
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,990
this my<font color="#E5E5E5"> point once you get over this</font>

69
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,180
build these things you have to expect a

70
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,180
lot of problems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

71
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,740
run into at least not quite as much when

72
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,180
you build networks in developing country

73
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,340
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to expect that the information</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get is far from perfect you</font>

tie down your t3 is coming in on rather

77
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,240
you're lucky if the guy who goes out

80
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,900
on you're able to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

81
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,250
troubleshoot it later and of course it's

82
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,170
the information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> imperfect you have to</font>

expect a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of changes almost all the</font>

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,518
all the arrangements made in these in

these developing world areas our

handshake agreements<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to a town</font>

sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contract with someone who frankly</font>

95
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,880
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a tower on the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

96
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,380
house and in exchange maybe I'll give

97
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,650
you a free<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet access and this is</font>

98
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:50,250
all done based on personalities of

99
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">course the language barriers are clear</font>

100
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,540
expertise barriers as well I made<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

101
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,670
comments earlier about how a lot very

102
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,019
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a dog about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how a lot of the</font>

103
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,339
operators that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font>

104
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,380
because we always partner with a local

105
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,870
company to do these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things how a lot of</font>

106
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">them were insisting on doing that for</font>

107
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,440
their entire backbone not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

108
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,440
edge of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> network but they believe</font>

109
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,230
that they couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even get addresses to</font>

110
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,228
publicly address their core networks so

111
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,599
takes a lot of patience to explain those

112
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:22,630
things and then and then probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

113
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,240
biggest thing coming from a developed

society

115
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,319
about these services is you have to

116
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,810
start to change the way you think about

117
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,220
these networks we're not talking five

118

fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time to that to</font>

with those expectations that guy who

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,880
do it well like I said you find a house

00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:07,009
someone willing to have a tower atop

134

137
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,630
and they say yes in this particular case

00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:27,440
had an old tower on the building I was

143
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,820
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to really identify what the</font>

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,830
old antenna on it was they weren't using

145
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,469
anymore some sort of omni antenna might

146
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,389
have inferred for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of radio</font>

147
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:37,430
reception i'm not really sure but the

148
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,099
the antenna on the left is is the new

149
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,570
antenna that we put up the new tower got

150
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,909
installed power again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

151
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,090
towns don't have power this particular

152
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:49,190
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> has power but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so unreliable we're</font>

153
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,710
actually using the the commercial power

154
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,180
is the backup power<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the solar luckily</font>

155
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">it should be sunny there enough that</font>

156
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,500
they keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> the batteries charged to</font>

157
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,479
figure the equipment get up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roof</font>

158
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:05,539
put it all together have your designs

159
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,219
climb<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tower and put it in it can be</font>

160
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:15,770
that simple thank goodness that is not

161
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:17,180
me I don't climb things that high um so

162

on the roof some wiring got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> lights</font>

174
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:49,420
too and here's a wiring closet inside

175
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,720
the house I don't know if yours looks

176

<font color="#CCCCCC">like this but there's a few is a few</font>

parts here to call out you know you've

178
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the POA injector that's what powers</font>

182
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,280
batteries that are powering this whole

183
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:13,479
thing plastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> flowers are very important</font>

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,180
house they don't again no electricity in

189
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,950
these areas it's a VoIP MTA in this case

190
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,960
the primary service were providing there

191
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,940
is voice they'd there's again no phone

192

lines no cell signal and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

phone and it's and it's you know the

194
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,060
cheapest phone you've probably seen in a

195
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,340
long time but but the user in this house

196
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,190
is absolutely thrilled he's able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

networks in developing world and moving

208
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,299
to this has been extremely interesting

209
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,960
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems you have to solve</font>

210
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,560
some of the things I didn't really

211
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention in here but it's here in Santo</font>

212
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,590
Domingo I'm sure we've all especially

213
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,940
people haven't really traveled

214

developing world very much have

215
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,960
experienced what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like to maybe have</font>

216
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,290
a little hard time finding diet pepsi in

217
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,090
the morning or or your your favorite gum

218

or something like that let me tell you

219
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,228
that that here in Santo Domingo this is

220
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,799
much more advanced<font color="#CCCCCC"> than places like</font>

221
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:37,870
Kigali Rwanda<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like if you if you</font>

226
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:49,240
as you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually had</font>

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:52,209
a my my laptop scream the video

228
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,580
the video card in my laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> died I have</font>

229
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,119
still had four days left there and I'm

230
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,860

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,100
you know the closest<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac stories to</font>

232
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,850
Rwanda somewhere in Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not real</font>

233
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,100
convenient sorry Wayne Roger Patrick El

234
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,950
Morocco my two questions first of all if

235
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,080
these guys can't pay 29 or even to 90 or

236
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,700
you're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> 29 cents who paid for</font>

237
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,740
all this or and if you said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

238
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,300
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understood ya know that they are</font>

239
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,890
paying subscribers they just they're

240
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,199
just not paying thirty dollars a month

241
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,060
what they you first of all the labor<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

242
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,290
cheap and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment were using tends</font>

243
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,239
to be very expending expensive but

244
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,760
they're still paying subscribers so they

245
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,310
may pay the equivalent of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. one</font>

246
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,770
dollar maybe maybe thirty five pesos a

247
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,209
month for their service it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

248
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,620
just the solar panel when the battery

249
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,000
were taking you know years to pay off

250
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,640
and to say nothing of the installation

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the back haul the trash so the the solar</font>

252
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,420
power in the battery usually the the

253
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,830
owner of the property is going to pay

254
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">for themselves because they're going to</font>

255
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,670
power other things off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that G we're</font>

256
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,980
not supplying that we're supplying the

257
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,380
cpe gear which is usually a cost upfront

258
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,000
to them too but it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

259
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">country it depends where you are some of</font>

264
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,970
just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on where you are and the</font>

265
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,439
second thing since everyone here has

266
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,610
filled out their survey right because if

267
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you haven't I get to come to know you</font>

268
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to email the nanog pc to say</font>

269
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,709
how good this presentation was since

270
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,680
you've already filled<font color="#E5E5E5"> out your survey</font>

271
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:27,880
and you can't put this<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your survey</font>

272
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,170
yeah it's oh thank you some have another

273
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,689
question

274
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:35,089
gives me I have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more question one</font>

275
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,940
more yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> dunfin wings of VI technical</font>

276
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,140
services for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your service for the like</font>

277
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,880
the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent to the mango maybe</font>

278
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">paranda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever bandwidth are you</font>

279
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,760
getting like going to the end user yes

280
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,570
so to the end user it's typically 128k

281
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm glad you asked that question</font>

282
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,770
actually does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something I meant to</font>

283
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,720
mention it's simply 128k up to maybe 512

284
