1
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:15,149
if you've fallen I would have been happy

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:16,770
no no that's wrong good morning um yeah

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,109
I heard I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't gonna get usurped and</font>

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,240
quite frankly I'm I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with that um</font>

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,949
I Martin leave him from hurricane

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,890
electric I know a bunch of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know me</font>

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,349
but what Josh just said is really why

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,900
I'm actually why I wanted us a spot

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,200
today was because there is this

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:38,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">misconception on the amount of traffic</font>

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,710
that exists globally in ipv6 world and I

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,329
really came to the conclusion that at

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,860
some point in time someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to go put</font>

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,020
some real numbers up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the screen and</font>

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,820
stand behind them and make sure that

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:55,980
what we're talking about here is

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:59,100
important enough to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to now</font>

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dave gave a talk yesterday and it's</font>

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,100
gonna be very different than mine I'm

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,709
gonna give you a bit of a rah-rah talk

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,630
now those that<font color="#E5E5E5"> know me know I'm going to</font>

22
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,850
give you a rah-rah talk but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

23
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,189
i'm also going to turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try a</font>

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,439
little bit of self-criticism so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

25
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,500
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

26
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:18,600
the easy one just nail the coffin on

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,000
this one it's done we talked about it

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,130
there's you know there's plenty of ipv6

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,049
peering out there we come from appearing

30
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,399
and routing community let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not</font>

31
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,770
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ever again the last</font>

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,560
slide you'll ever hear from<font color="#CCCCCC"> me at one of</font>

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">these conferences well unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to gpf in three days and then you</font>

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear it again I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

36
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the traffic levels and I'm going to pick</font>

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,159
some I'm going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,810
verbally<font color="#E5E5E5"> about stuff I can you know that</font>

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's easy to talk about some that's</font>

40
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,840
hard to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> final part</font>

41
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:51,630
i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about is does this</font>

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,479
really matter so again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opening</font>

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,369
that Josh gave me is the cynical

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,350
response you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily put together a</font>

45
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,659
panel of people who will talk about

46
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,339
either sides of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this argument but I'm</font>

47
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,469
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that does</font>

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,719
the traffic levels really is that really

49
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,878
the issue that we have with v6 or or or

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,479
the stuff that they've talked about

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,159
yesterday

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:20,000
so all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world there's nothing</font>

54
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:22,519
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> place where it's it's it's</font>

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,659
it's hard to find a v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange where</font>

56
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,799
you're going to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> another exchange</font>

57
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:30,920
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all places that we the no love</font>

58
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:35,840
participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in or have built some of</font>

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,399
some a distant summer local the ends

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock guys a meeting in a couple of</font>

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,370
days time in New Zealand they've got you

62
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,149
know two or three exchanges they're all

63
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:50,680
of which are happily you know v6 other

64
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:54,049
places in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world without a problem</font>

65
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,060
this graph though is sort of a measure

66
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:58,819
of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at those various</font>

67
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,159
locations this is this is data that's

68
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:03,078
been highly interpreted through about

69
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:05,599
three different stages so it's a bunch

70
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:08,510
of Oregon data that is collected and

71
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,530
then interpreted by Jeff Houston I then

72
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:15,138
took that data historically and went out

73
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,870
and and processed through it to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

74
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:20,419
work out how many interconnects how many

75
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,760
adjacencies are between different v6

76
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:25,720
backbones now we all know that there's

77
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,709
peering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all know that there is</font>

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,620
exchanges<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how much</font>

79
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:36,319
is it being used so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sum of</font>

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,669
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those adjacencies</font>

81
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,129
that can be found<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the number of</font>

82
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:41,780
sessions because an adjacency between

83
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:44,810
two backbones may exist in multiple

84
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:49,430
locations but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the adjacency</font>

85
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:52,549
count and it's rising steadily it goes

86
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,470
up or down and and we've looked at why

87
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,389
that is there's a few holes in the data

88
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,209
here that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a data collection issue</font>

89
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,639
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't change the the overall</font>

90
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,819
trend<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I went looked</font>

91
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:08,690
yesterday on our backbone and we're just

92
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:10,819
above you know 400<font color="#CCCCCC"> v GP neighbors on in</font>

93
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,159
the v6 world on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our side and I know</font>

94
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:16,430
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very aggressive about this but the</font>

95
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,769
bottom line is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's a</font>

96
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of players they are getting their</font>

peering act together

98
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:31,310
there is traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry and the net net</font>

99
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,620
of this is you know that's that's the

100
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,650
proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers-wise that we needed to see</font>

101
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that things are happening so</font>

102
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,440
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of success there's a</font>

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,880
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mistakes there's a couple of</font>

the I exes who have been successful in

there and actually promoting their

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,550
remembering to edit their homepage or

110
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,740
equivalent page they're remembering to

111
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,440
put their ipv6 addresses on their

112
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,200
members list not just the v4 addresses

113
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,390
they are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at either easy</font>

114
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,800
allocation methods that make it easy but

115
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,830
keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind exchange points are</font>

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,580
inherently layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 so therefore this</font>

117
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:16,010
shouldn't be hard getting reverse DNS

118
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,200
seems to be a lot harder getting reverse

119
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,480
dns and convincing exchange points to do

120
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,370
that which by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way is useful because</font>

121
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,530
guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that enables you to look and</font>

122
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,440
see whether you have a particular

123
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,630
neighbor on there ah look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that</font>

124
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,610
reverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS that that could be somebody</font>

125
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:36,050
I want to appear with there's a few

126
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:39,800
mistakes some exchanges are still doing

127
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:42,500
two ports 14 v 6 14 v for that sometimes

128
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,150
useful if you're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a network</font>

129
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,570
and you're testing it on a couple of

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">side ralpherz but if your dual stacking</font>

131
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,169
then you really only need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single port</font>

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to reference you but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

136
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,800
the author of it and well worth tracking

a few other places i believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

139
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,690
one which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just find pretty funny is</font>

140
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,380
that we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few people who have</font>

talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that exchanges are</font>

wanting to build a customer for an

143
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,680
additional address v6 address and that's

144
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a little bit of a limitation</font>

145
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,639
and if anybody thinks then finds that

146
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,889
and then

147
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:32,439
you know wants to go correct that please

148
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:34,699
do it seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a negative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> step for</font>

149
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,210
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something that's obvious like</font>

150
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:41,419
adding v62 up to a layer to exchange

151
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's talk about traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

152
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,520
I've done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm done with</font>

153
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">appearing doesn't need to be talked</font>

154
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,240
about anymore so I grabbed a couple of

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,599
graphs and have a caveat here doing flow

156
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,360
stats is an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having faith in</font>

157
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,909
data so we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to throw away</font>

158
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,069
most of our flow stats as of about three

159
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:03,710
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when we found an interesting</font>

160
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:05,539
little problem and something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

161
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,359
to you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize we didn't</font>

162
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:10,340
have the confidence level on the data

163
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,689
the numbers were higher which you know

164
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,400
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we thought was great but it</font>

165
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:15,289
actually turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now we have a</font>

166
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,900
higher confidence factor so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got some</font>

167
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:20,990
some useful numbers what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

168
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,479
took all the data over a whole backbone

169
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,520
and looked at making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we weren't</font>

170
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,370
double counting and looking at where we

171
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,740
where where we were getting v6 traffic

172
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,479
and that was our numbers we were we were

173
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,740
running at about a bit about you know

174
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,318
just below about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gigs worth of</font>

175
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,580
bandwidth over the backbone some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dawn's</font>

176
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,930
essentially all the inbound and outbound

177
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,419
ports between source and destination and

178
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,610
then we jumped about literally about

179
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:50,750
four days ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> five days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last week</font>

180
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:53,360
and I spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time sitting there</font>

181
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,669
going okay what interesting customer has

182
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,039
just turned up with a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch more</font>

183
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,080
v6 traffic and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the norm are we</font>

184
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see big jumps as opposed to</font>

185
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,979
incremental growth so I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you I'll</font>

186
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,240
show you where that traffic is and we'll

187
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,729
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about it in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font>

188
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,659
but I also wanted to go get one other

189
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:13,460
graph the the awesome dealt and and

190
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,909
addressed one issue that people have is

191
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,680
you know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there any peering traffic so</font>

192
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:21,560
I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and I went through a bunch of</font>

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">different peers and randomly without</font>

194
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,879
name picked one particular peer and

195
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:30,889
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know we hear globally</font>

196
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,959
we have both got a fair amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

197
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,969
customers and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> an out and looked</font>

198
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,179
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're just summed</font>

199
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:40,810
easily was about 60 or 70 makes of

200
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:44,420
pick between one<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer and ourselves</font>

201
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:47,599
again I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn around and</font>

202
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">say there is terrible worth of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way I</font>

203
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,950
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's real band</font>

204
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,420
width and therefore this is something

205
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,870
that's worth taking a little bit more

206
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,819
seriously and and the comment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

207
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,350
it's the the the comment about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

208
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,730
only being<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or two or three megabits</font>

209
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,830
worth of traffic so why bother doing

210
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,089
this sort of really gets the nail<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

211
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the coffin and we're done with</font>

212
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:10,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that conversation so that that was a</font>

213
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,520
summary of about five or six peering

214
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,829
sessions over over about a week seems

215
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,250
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent with what we were</font>

216
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,380
expecting and we often looked at the

217
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific traffic on particular exchanges</font>

218
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,850
now some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanges have got</font>

219
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,760
published information on the v6s flow

220
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,890
data obviously not on a per port basis

221
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:35,180
because that's customer dependent so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

222
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:38,029
looked at our traffic and so on on the

223
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,099
links exchange in london where we have a

224
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,050
fair amount appears you know i was

225
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:48,230
looking at around 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 30 megabits</font>

226
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:49,579
worth of average traffic no this is set

227
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,250
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pierce a set of international peers</font>

228
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:56,779
there really wasn't a problem you know

229
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:59,029
that that seemed about right am-6 has a

230
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:01,490
different story that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

231
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:03,770
traffic it has a lot more traffic for a

232
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,440
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different reasons it has a</font>

233
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,360
mixture of customers to disparate

234
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,430
customers actually that really moved the

235
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,550
most amount of traffic or Pierce as I

236
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:16,310
say one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which is the fact that we see</font>

237
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:19,010
a lot of usenet traffic and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font>

238
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">of becoming a well known fact but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

239
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,540
becoming more and more usenet traffic

240
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,790
that's been moved over to v6 from before

241
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's really the key phrase there</font>

242
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:33,920
it's being moved over from v6 of v4 w6

243
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:36,319
there is a simple movement of traffic

244
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,649
over protocols it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a creation of a</font>

245
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,110
new killer app for v6 it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brand</font>

246
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:44,149
new website that's only available v6

247
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,670
it's just simply the movement of traffic

248
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:49,610
and this may be one of the easiest

249
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Norm's to to see on the v6 world because</font>

250
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,470
it's between players that agree that

251
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,770
they're both running v6 this is not even

252
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a to an end user I'm</font>

253
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wondering if you think that</font>

254
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,930
phenomenon is something like the

255
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,310
BitTorrent phenomenon where bittorrent

256
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,170
traffic gets moved or to these six

257
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:11,260
because nobody has filtering capability

258
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,670
really i mean that's real it's actually

259
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,250
with you you're specifically referencing

260
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">one dot 8 micro Taran release and the</font>

261
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,570
various v6 code inside that yeah yeah

262
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,510
and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a jump</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

263
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,130
point but but actually we're seeing more

264
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,740
using it traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> than what we think is</font>

265
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,689
bittorrent traffic but it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

266
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,230
yes there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more part about that</font>

267
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:35,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">which I'll address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a moment what's</font>

268
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,310
also interesting is that we saw another

269
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,580
set of peering turn up about four days

270
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,260
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just put the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 45 days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and I</font>

271
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,360
just put the graph in there where we

272
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,030
suddenly saw for one particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer</font>

273
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,390
a whole jump of this you know hundred

274
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,100
plus megabits worth of traffic and we

275
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,860
went off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at where it was and</font>

276
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,130
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one customer to one peer across</font>

277
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,530
the Atlantic and it was a database

278
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:04,400
replication code specifically between

279
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:06,530
two data centers that were armed or two

280
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,670
entities that were the same entity and

281
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,890
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again an example of be 42 v6</font>

282
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,819
migration of traffic that's being done

283
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:19,699

levels or the traffic in the v6 world

287

internal two applications internal 2222

289
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,730
multi-site applications on that there's

290
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,640
as much reason to use v6 as there is

291
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,070
before I'll address that at the end but

292
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">this actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made me hit some of the of</font>

293
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,240
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with the with at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

294
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,320
with micro torrent there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

295
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,720
talk of AP Nick which had some stats on

296
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,790
this and it got me thinking back in

297
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,170
August went back and looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some</font>

298
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,649
of the traffic it took us a long time to

299
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,529
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

300
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:04,480
so we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at six to four and</font>

301
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:07,249
we started looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at not just the core</font>

302
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,069
networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a pretty good ipv6</font>

303
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:12,529
backbone we knew we would peering we

304
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:14,389
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a lot of customer traffic we</font>

305
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:16,040
knew that that part was dealt with now

306
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens in all the edge conditions</font>

307
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,069
and 624 was the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we looked</font>

308
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:23,809
at 64 as a protocol exists that I've got

309
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:26,599
some stats on just how much it exists

310
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:28,279
later on but we realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was</font>

311
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">a whole set of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic and when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

312
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:34,220
to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to users either users on our</font>

313
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,110
v6 backbone or just or tunnel broker

314
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,699
users whether it be our tunnel broker or

315
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,610
other people people who were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

316
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:42,649
get you know proactive in getting

317
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,389
connected to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 they were finding that</font>

318
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:47,179
there was still a lot of requirement for

319
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:49,459
moving bits around or on a 64

320
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:52,369
translation relay and those relays

321
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:54,859
weren't very efficient for them so what

322
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:58,300
we did was<font color="#E5E5E5"> we went out and put seven</font>

323
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,249
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> with seven six to four relays</font>

324
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,689
globally and it took a while it took a

325
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:05,749
long while before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually had any</font>

326
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:07,819
faith in doing this and it made for a

327
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:09,379
very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> first day when we</font>

328
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:11,179
turned it on turn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> off fixed a few</font>

329
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:13,129
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally brought into</font>

330
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:16,399
production and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> up around the</font>

331
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:19,939
globe very quickly getting this any

332
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,529
casted 624 environment up and running

333
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:24,170
and we've got about another 15 that

334
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,059
we're going to deploy and even with

335
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,660
seven we've managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get ourselves a</font>

336
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:31,219
fairly good idea of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

337
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:35,389
traffic wise and we saw some stuff that

338
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:38,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">was was which made sense but but what it</font>

339
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,980
boiled down to to present it here was I

340
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,509
turned around and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's look</font>

341
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,709
at what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on between europe and</font>

342
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:47,269
the united states with with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic</font>

343
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,518
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of its moving around how much</font>

344
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,559
is bouncing just like we heard on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

345
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,480
previous traceroute talk where you can

346
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,069
you can look at where traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

347
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,809
the problem when you're looking at six

348
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:58,670
to four or any other tunnel protocol is

349
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:00,910
pretty damn hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually work out</font>

350
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:04,270
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is</font>

351
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,339
so we were getting a certain amount of

352
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:10,420
64 traffic on our backbone but but but

353
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:13,630
not a brilliant amount but we had enough

354
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">and when we finish turning this all on</font>

355
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:19,180
all the transatlantic traffic

356
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,550
disappeared so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> summary of</font>

357
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,290
traffic between Europe and the United

358
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,420
States it seemed like the easiest place

359
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,069
to measure this we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing</font>

360
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,810
it sort of East Coast<font color="#CCCCCC"> West Coast in the</font>

361
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">US and then we sort of realized that</font>

362
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,869
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 relays were today that were</font>

363
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,069
being any casted really weren't quite in

364
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,480
places that made any sense but but

365
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,510
between Europe and the US it made

366
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:45,700
perfect sense so we turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the relays</font>

367
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:47,710
and instantly we saw much of the traffic

368
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">well we saw all of the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disappear</font>

369
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the transatlantic links but we also</font>

370
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,220
realized that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were doing relaying</font>

371
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:58,599
both between v4 and v6 and between v6

372
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,430
and v4 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not explaining what 64 is</font>

373
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,800
because you'll have Google and Wikipedia

374
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,380
and you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and RFC editor and you</font>

375
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,180
can go look it up if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know what</font>

376
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,400
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually that's a good thing but</font>

377
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,530
but it's a transition mechanism that

378
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,410
maybe will go away at some point bottom

379
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,630
line was that improving the efficiency

380
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,390
and getting traffic lower also meant

381
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,760
that the users experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> would really</font>

382
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,069
work was the ultimate issue here got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

383
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,260
be better if i look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the expanded</font>

384
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,520
graph this was this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

385
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,170
graph that showed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

386
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,310
problems here if I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mouse so</font>

387
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:37,180
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only graph</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to</font>

388
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:41,250
show too much data right we're right

389
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,250
where my mouse is just fit

390
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,560
no mouse anyway right between week 1 and

391
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:51,390
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 is when we realize we had s flow</font>

392
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,099
data that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to throw away so</font>

393
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,590
ignore everything prior to that but the

394
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,720
bottom line was that we saw the we saw a

395
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:01,800
reduction in the traffic going eastwards

396
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,410
going westwards sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Europe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

397
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,000
US right<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that point which made</font>

398
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,600
perfect sense or for this type of

399
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,849
traffic will send up with this new track

400
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,909
new customer traffic going over at some

401
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:17,099
point as well now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one we</font>

402
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,360
looked at was trade up again we're

403
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,399
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these edge conditions but</font>

404
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,829
guess what is the edge conditions that

405
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,390
seemed to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hiccup for most new</font>

406
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,099
users when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> started hey I'm</font>

407
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,810
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this v6 thing and you</font>

408
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to have the too many hiccups</font>

409
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:34,649
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 is similar but a different</font>

410
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:37,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">protocol but the bottom line was that we</font>

411
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,000
knew that we knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were relays</font>

412
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're operating public relays that</font>

413
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're operating and but they weren't</font>

414
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,770
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of them again the references</font>

415
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,110
on the RFC or if you just want to read

416
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,660
these easier to read Wikipedia entry I

417
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:55,280
do not recommend replacing IETF with

418
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,200
Wikipedia so we looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic</font>

419
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,149
the gap is our data collection not not

420
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,770
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we basically found</font>

421
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,570
that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was all on our backbone</font>

422
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,090
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> eastward we were taking</font>

423
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,659
traffic even<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Asia in some cases and</font>

424
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,730
moving all the way over to Amsterdam a

00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,440
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask them for that but it's available</font>

431
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,750
on the web and they've been announcing

432
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,810
the appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> teredo prefix for a</font>

433
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,000
while as have a few other players but

434
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,740
but these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to get the majority</font>

435
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">of traffic at the present moment in time</font>

436
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,210
and that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> again for a user</font>

437
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's interested in using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Torito</font>

438
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,260
whether they are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it willingly or</font>

439
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,420
unwillingly whether they're doing it

440
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,690
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been automatically</font>

441
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,160
enabled on a Windows platform or which

442
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,740
can happen with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> installation of</font>

443
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,510
certain software or they've done it

444
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,790
because that's the best practices way

445
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:01,120
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> two disparate v6 islands to talk</font>

446
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,470
to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other you can in fact end up</font>

447
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,870
realizing that yeah we're moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

448
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,460
awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic even though 40 to</font>

449
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,139
50 megs may not be a lot this is the

450
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">signaling traffic the way the Teredo</font>

451
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,570
works is it's predominately signaling

452
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">with insight 2001 cold and 32 colon</font>

453
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:18,909
colon 32 so so that was sort of an

454
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,170
interesting measurement we haven't done

455
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not that</font>

459
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,510
know it's again another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

460
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,120
education so where does this all lead me

461
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,250
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told about traffic levels and I've</font>

00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,659
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tried to be about as balance</font>

between proprietary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm propriety</font>

464
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,280
I'd love to to throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a graph of you</font>

465
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,750
know which will never happen of every

466
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,040
pair to every pair but it's just that's

467
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,370
just not going to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that</font>

468
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,629
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is outside of the</font>

469
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,239
quantitative what's the qualitative

470
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,440
aspect of this at what point in time do

471
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,120
we turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say look even if we</font>

472
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,560
have low power and bandwidth levels

473
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,689
compared to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements that we</font>

474
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,300
have on an ipv4 backbone of installing

475
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,030
and by 10 gigs of putting 40 gig cards

476
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,190
in of wanting people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are doing 100</font>

477
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,720
gig work to talk at this conference so

478
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we actually understand where are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go next so so so the</font>

480
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,300
qualitative thing is is this enough

481
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,129
reason to turn round and say I need to

482
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,610
be ready I need to have I need to have

483
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:26,020
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the backbone I've been well you</font>

484
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,639
know this I've been preaching this for a

485
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,520
while other pitching for a while even

486
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,950
Dave's talk yesterday you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

487
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,660
does show a balance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little</font>

488
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,150
bit more complicated there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

489
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,250
other issues there's an enormous you

490
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,840
can't take<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from the fact that if</font>

491
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,720
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running an access network whether</font>

492
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,310
you're a cable company or a telco you

493
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,800
have an enormous<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of work and you</font>

494
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,570
have some amazing complexity to deal

495
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,690
with and you have complicated decisions

496
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,600
whether they be<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry a great net</font>

497
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:57,760
decisions or not we have it easy at the

498
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,370
IP backbone level we have it much easier

499
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,050
moving the bits around is easier so we

500
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,929
went off and tried to find a non-traffic

501
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,320
mashup

502
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,900
and we started collecting which we in no

503
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,110
way have enough data to do time mapping

504
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,030
on but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started collecting information</font>

505
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,740
we started with with just taking the

506
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,990
easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we could dumping the</font>

507
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,700
dot-com domain every day and then

508
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,250
dumping through the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

509
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,070
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every quad a record that</font>

510
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,380
could ever exist below<font color="#E5E5E5"> every domain so</font>

511
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:31,520
we would look for a quad a on on on on

512
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:33,230
example calm and on<font color="#CCCCCC"> WWE's ample calm we</font>

513
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,629
look at the MX record and see if it had

514
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,700
a quad a on MX records see if it had a

515
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,220
quad<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight and just just pummeling this</font>

516
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,850
we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case you want to know how we</font>

517
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">did this we actually built a DNS</font>

518
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:50,540
resolver cloud to to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because as</font>

519
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,729
of the week or so ago when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> grabbed</font>

520
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,129
these data there was 78 million domains

521
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,600
so it actually that'll blow up a dummy

522
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:01,880
that will blow up a resolver pretty

523
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:03,500
quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is what we found so this</font>

524
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,410
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the looking for all the people who</font>

525
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,150
had quad a records anywhere as best as

526
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,300
we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push and we look for ipv6</font>

527
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,340
example calm as well by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way sorry</font>

528
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,480
because that obviously exists and we

529
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,980
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of found some interesting results</font>

530
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,800
now some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are either humorous</font>

531
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,390
sad or they show promise or you just

532
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize these numbers are just very low</font>

533
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,730
but they're there so we found if you

534
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,850
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key areas here inside</font>

535
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:31,310
the 2000 / 3 area where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get unicast</font>

536
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,590
legitimate addresses you know so we

537
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:36,050
found 42,000 addresses we found people

538
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,639
out there that are actively doing work

539
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,399
of course we found lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other stuff</font>

540
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just isn't what we wanted to see be</font>

541
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,360
four maps addresses v4 compatible

542
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,790
addresses which are two different things

543
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones deprecated we obviously found</font>

544
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,470
you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a handful in the 624 space</font>

545
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,780
which was sort of interesting and one

546
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,150
clear why that was there the reason why

547
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,330
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them may say localhost whatever</font>

548
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,310
there may be good reasons for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

549
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:04,879
you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a note to Bill Manning let</font>

550
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:06,200
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> bongo please it needs to go just get</font>

551
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,240
rid of you know the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the last</font>

552
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,470
here

553
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,139
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are all I wrestle them</font>

554
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,639
are all noise we're now trying to run

555
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:16,580
this we can't quite run it every day

556
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:18,439
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just too much data and somebody's</font>

557
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get annoyed at us so we're</font>

558
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">working out whether we can do it about</font>

559
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,570
weekly at the present moment in time and

560
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,880
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start collecting some stats</font>

561
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,830
we've been doing this which has been on

562
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">our ipv6 website we've been collecting</font>

563
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,418
information much simple in this just

564
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:34,189
looking at top level domain name servers

565
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:36,230
and domains and the like but the bottom

566
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,330
line out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is that that there is</font>

567
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,440
this sort of gut feeling and I'm an

568
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,590
optimist<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's this gut feeling</font>

569
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,200
that that something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on out there</font>

570
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:49,220
it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be that we see a majority of</font>

571
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,049
78 million domains out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

572
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,139
that brings us down to this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

573
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:56,480
really down at the end now are we really

574
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:58,490
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm not</font>

575
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to listen until there's lots of</font>

576
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,970
traffic of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to be</font>

577
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of traffic until you listen so you</font>

578
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,129
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an easy one the second part</font>

579
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:09,529
is is that lot are we going to dismiss

580
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:10,610
the traffic the comment about the fact

581
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:13,730
that there's a fair amount of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

582
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,830
v6 traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a bad thing because</font>

583
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,440
it's being done between players that

584
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,449
both know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their v6 enabled and</font>

585
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,340
they've realized that that type of

586
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,019
traffic is perfectly acceptable its

587
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,320
replacement traffic it's not a new

588
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:29,240
application and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the simple simple</font>

589
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,250
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one replacement for existing port</font>

590
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,019
v4 traffic if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

591
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,129
ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing v6 then it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

592
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:36,019
you're going to lose revenue if your

593
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:38,178
business is based upon bandwidth it may

594
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:40,580
be that simple it just may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

595
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:41,990
simple and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really boils down to this</font>

596
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,539
last question<font color="#CCCCCC"> so does it really matter</font>

597
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,750
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> which protocol it uses now this has</font>

598
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:50,179
been another topic which came up and

599
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,500
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off of our</font>

600
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:54,200
backbone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example of a</font>

601
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,480
different talk there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been some</font>

602
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that said look if you've got v6</font>

603
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,610
you should use it now scratch my head on

604
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:05,178
this one a little bit because if you

605
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,428
have v6 yes use it but that if you have

606
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:09,950
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well and you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lack</font>

607
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,450
of v4 addresses of both<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends I don't</font>

608
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's a penalty and that's how we</font>

609
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,880
operate predominately today so if both

610
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,580
ends are v6 and b4 enabled

611
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,690
sometimes you get situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

612
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,280
someone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't say well you should</font>

613
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:27,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">have used v6 well not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know I</font>

614
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,720
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an enthusiastic about v6 but in</font>

615
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,760
reality the final point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you you</font>

616
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,160
know if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got applications that are</font>

617
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,320
available in both of them then it's not

618
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,230
the end of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we keep going in</font>

619
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,820
the b4 world for traffic it would be

620
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,190
good to see it would be good to see

621
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,919
everybody again from an advantage

622
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,570
evangelical points of pushing this but

623
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,780
it's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the world anyway</font>

624
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,760
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about today i</font>

625
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,310
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hit some traffic levels</font>

626
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,490
turn around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know that this</font>

627
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,050
is this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to 10 100 megabits</font>

628
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,640
around the world there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than</font>

629
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've only got the numbers off of</font>

630
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,150
our backbone so the theory is the

631
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,550
numbers can only be higher if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you</font>

632
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:11,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at everybody else's that's it</font>

633
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:13,760
that's what I want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

634
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously we'll take questions comments</font>

635
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,890
criticism except for

636
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:24,178
good morning Erin huge garden I'm

637
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:26,010
curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have split out tunnel</font>

638
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:33,360
traffic versus native connected traffic

639
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:36,000
to figure out percentage of usage on our

640
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:41,010
network very low in the backbone side of

641
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,830
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there are probably two maybe</font>

642
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:48,330
three major backbones that still need

643
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,649
need tunneled connections and and those

644
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that have pretty much the</font>

645
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:54,779
least amount of traffic anyway on the

646
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">end user the people using tunnel broker</font>

647
00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:00,720
type services then I know from our stats

648
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">there them they're very small compared</font>

649
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this I mean if it accounts for an</font>

650
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,899
average<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 well maybe a bit</font>

651
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:12,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">more maybe maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worst case about 40</font>

652
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:14,340
mags worth of end user traffic as

653
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:17,459
opposed to to back them but tunnels on

654
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,740
the backbone are really only they only

655
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,039
really exist as peering tunnels<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

656
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:26,700
back bones are still running tunnel

translator or something like that why

665
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,070
well this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all out of these</font>

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,350
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you're talking about yeah</font>

667
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,350
these are all out of DNS so somebody

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:10,889
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to type an FF FF address into a</font>

quad a that's what they've done it is

670
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:15,900
amazingly high number and and it may

671
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:20,030
just be complete misconception as to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

675
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:36,570
mean the numbers really high<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

676
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:38,850
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the only place that well yes</font>

677
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,490
there are places where we see clusters

678
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,590
of these and then we see there lots of

679
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,380
random ones and we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done any real</font>

680
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:49,139
cluster analysis on this yet but I will

681
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,150
tell you that yes there are a few domain

682
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,820
shops where we see large amounts of

683
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,860
domains registered and being held that

684
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,870
that have these these v4 mapped

685
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,270
addresses so it could simply be one

686
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,719
person making one mistake and therefore

687
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:07,320
generating a large number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> records</font>

688
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:11,060
it's quite quite possible yeah Jolie

689
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">egli I would look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you know auto</font>

690
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:18,270
configuring network appliances like

691
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Infoblox that I'm not infoblox</font>

692
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:22,330
specifically because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

693
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,820
does that at this point but

694
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:27,789
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple of those DNS</font>

695
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,789
appliances that have now supported v6 so

696
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can imagine one producing that for</font>

697
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:36,250
every record that I created yeah the

698
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,649
issue is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we have not done is</font>

699
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,570
done this whole cluster<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis to</font>

700
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:43,418
where it's coming from but but they're

701
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,769
out there but good or bad they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

702
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:48,909
the ones we really care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about to be</font>

703
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:50,679
honest hey Martin so um I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we at</font>

704
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:52,299
some point saw that that there are some

705
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,399
products that automatically populate had

706
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,899
to the gentleman's question or pointing

707
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,908
on the front so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's a big number</font>

708
00:29:55,899 --> 00:30:00,729
to be like user error or an accident<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

709
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:02,740
mean yeah yeah it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the point to</font>

710
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">your to your comment i mean frankly i</font>

711
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,820
think it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing to do if v6</font>

712
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,289
is available you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go with it</font>

713
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:13,539
right i mean that's kind of best way for

714
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:15,879
us to keep things evolving know the

715
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:18,970
answer to that is yes in other words the

716
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,460
more traffic there is the the more proof

717
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,350
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the community that we</font>

718
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:27,010
have to do something in your case<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

719
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:29,199
it's it's business case proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

720
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,539
you want for your particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> your access</font>

721
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,070
network so you want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um the</font>

722
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:35,769
subtle point is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually came out</font>

723
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a conversation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was I was always a</font>

724
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:40,870
hundred percent pro if you've got v4 and

725
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:43,799
v6 connectivity always used v6 and I

726
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:48,549
sent an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email to from our v6 enabled</font>

727
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:50,889
mail servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent an email to somebody</font>

728
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:53,559
else in the community here who promptly

729
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:55,049
in the in the end of the email after

730
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:57,460
addressing the subject said by the way

731
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've sent us an email on a default</font>

732
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,860
connection you didn't connect via v6 and

733
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,659
I said well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's wrong and I went</font>

734
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,789
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and looked at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said no there's an</font>

735
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:09,940
MX record for v6 as an MX record for v4

736
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:12,639
they're equal there's no reason I mean

737
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,220
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> artificial bias inside</font>

738
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:17,979
the code to actually have picked for you

739
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,169
know as simple as a transaction as smtp

740
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,149
to pick v6 and that sort of changed my

741
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,580
mind a little bit here as long as this

742
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:25,870
connectivity and

743
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,428
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm cheating because I'm only</font>

744
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,168
talking at the backbone level not at the

745
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:35,350
access level which you have much much

746
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:38,159
harder task with so all right I'm done

747
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,158
thank you
