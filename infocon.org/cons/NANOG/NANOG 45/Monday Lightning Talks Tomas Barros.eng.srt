CL and i'm here to present you one

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:40,850
dessert we have done using a simulator

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,559
to analyze our network so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our</font>

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,970
neighbor looks like we have several

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,669
resolvers around the world anyway most

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,559
of the resolver outside chillier they

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,520
are contract we have mainly little

13
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:59,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">tonometer i think they give us the</font>

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,109
service of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS resolver so we don't</font>

15
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:07,369
control that servers but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> chile way we</font>

16
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:09,890
have four servers and this is in 2007 I

17
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:13,789
you will see later why I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,789
2007 we have three servers in a cloud

19
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:18,890
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Santiago to coppell and</font>

20
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:20,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">Valparaiso which are different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cities in</font>

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chile and they are located</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in different</font>

22
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:27,080
cities and we have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> unica server its</font>

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">colonies and each one is connected to a</font>

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:35,179
different internet service provider in

25
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chile and we may have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions I mean</font>

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,820
we we always have questioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> like whole</font>

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:44,200
strength is our net I mean what will

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,059
have if a server crash or to surprise

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,610
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third question also is</font>

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,579
interesting that which combination is

31
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,920
best should we put more unica servers or

32
00:01:52,579 --> 00:02:00,199
solving<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS queries should we have more</font>

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:03,049
node to the actual a cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,460
there and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we cannot</font>

35
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,549
test that in the production

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:10,008
infrastructure because we just cannot

37
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:13,790
put down several servers at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

38
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:16,250
time without affecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service so we</font>

39
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">are proposing in the research lab and if</font>

40
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:23,570
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are proposing to use a simulator to</font>

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,570
do that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of analysis and this is how</font>

42
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,600
we did our simulation we make a big

43
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,670
abstraction of the net where

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,859
we put for autonomous system

45
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,500
representing<font color="#E5E5E5"> four different internet</font>

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,120
service provider each one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the node is</font>

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,540
connected to one of this autonomous

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,630
system for the simulation we use the

49
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,679
Georgia Tech network<font color="#E5E5E5"> simulator which is</font>

50
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,859
a real implementation of sight zebra

<font color="#E5E5E5">over an s2 that is the probably the most</font>

52
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,630
use it metal simulator in the academia

53
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,530
and is mainly used for testing new

54
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:02,980
protocols and we have programmed well

55
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,260
the dns server and also dns resolver or

56
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,540
client that use around robbing the

57
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:13,019
policy and choose the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> round trip</font>

tank to as the default dns server I

59
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:20,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna skip that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how it's done is</font>

60
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,549
is the simulation work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> c++ files</font>

61
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,799
here i have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> result for when</font>

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,400
experiment this is for validating the

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,520
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean in 2007 and that's why i</font>

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,920
was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 2007 network we</font>

65
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,410
did a real experiment in the real

66
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,339
network where we have two down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the node</font>

67
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:45,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">santiago in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> indicas cloud and we we</font>

68
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,010
have this data so we have making<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

69
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,440
simulation in the same settings to

70
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:54,149
validate that our simulation will will

71
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">be close to reality that's the result</font>

72
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,760
for the simulation way we have used<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,710
quarry right that is the average I don't

74
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,370
know if I haven't area that is the

75
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:09,280
average of the real case and as you can

76
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,260
see looks very very similar at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,350
distribution of the queries on the other

78
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,079
servers but since we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

79
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:20,290
how the redistribution of the chorus was

80
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:25,359
happening with just the percentage and

81
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:30,520
there he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more closer and after</font>

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,790
this first try we realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe it</font>

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,190
can be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean we we was it wasn't</font>

84
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,260
sure at the beginning but<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we run</font>

85
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sparing we see that the simulated</font>

86
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,719
case was really close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real</font>

87
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:47,289
so a simulation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net can be useful</font>

88
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:53,800
for for further analysis and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

89
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:57,279
did we sorry we were playing around with

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the simulator the last year at Nick</font>

91
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,680
chill we add a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> node to the to the</font>

92
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:06,400
cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is located in LA in the</font>

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,529
United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this what we took the</font>

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,210
bandwidth and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> round-trip data we put</font>

95
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:13,090
in the simulator we had the node and

96
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:18,909
this is our result so at<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

97
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:22,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client preferred the cloud</font>

98
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:24,669
and it specifically the LA node but

99
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">after a way because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the round trip</font>

100
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:30,758
I'm best broccoli because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the best</font>

101
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,710
front three they policy the happy client

102
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,289
they choose an asset I was closer was

103
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,359
its interior if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything this is a</font>

104
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:40,628
simulation case but if anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,589
does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in reality when they</font>

106
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:48,189
just like the LA not to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font>

107
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:50,169
all the charge went first to LA and then

108
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:52,210
to an essay was really close I don't

109
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:56,830
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data yet so i cannot connect</font>

110
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:59,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you bruh so again the model was</font>

111
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,680
validated again and we play a little bit

112
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,529
more so instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> having the delay node</font>

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,189
to the existing cloud we make we made a

114
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:11,800
new cloud putting together NS an LA and

115
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:13,930
there we have much<font color="#E5E5E5"> better result elite</font>

116
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,710
in the distribution of the of the

117
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,659
queries and as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> expected the LA node</font>

118
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,849
didn't receive any<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries which is</font>

119
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:23,349
normal because it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serve</font>

120
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:26,469
only the car is coming from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> states</font>

121
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:30,449
and not from Chile<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this is we</font>

122
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,449
have only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic coming from Chile</font>

123
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:38,500
so the conclusion are that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

124
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">result are promising in the in despair</font>

125
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,150
Amanda we compared with the with the

126
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,060
real case in 2007 we have only seven

127
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">person of difference so the the tool can</font>

128
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:54,130
be really useful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze further</font>

129
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:55,450
configurations this metallic we we

130
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,150
believe can be applied to other

applications by use the net special

132
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,659
distributed applications we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> for analyzed new new technologies</font>

134
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mentioned here like using DNS but</font>

and make more testing and analyzing we

simulation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're gonna provide some</font>

146
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of easy language to make change</font>

147
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,780
well we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding simulation of</font>

course to get closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reality and the</font>

last one is a bitch d subject in fact

150
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,780
beginning we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a simulator</font>

151
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:01,510
that can be dynamically updated and then

152
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,520
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can plug this dynamic update</font>

153
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,920
simulator to the real data in the

154
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,169
service so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have always the</font>

155
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,600
simulator up to date and we can

156
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything we want we can make some</font>

157
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,030
testing over the simulator to have a

158
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">lists a taste of what will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen if we</font>

159
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:22,409
do the same in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real network and</font>

160
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:26,239
that's all I know any question

161
