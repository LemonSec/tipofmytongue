00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">opinions after this presentation so</font>

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,210
let's go ahead this presentation

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,539
describes the recent experience i had my

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,480
at home myself what happened was<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,519
bought a new wireless router because it

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">had all sorts of new buttons tweaks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm a geek so I bought a new one and</font>

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,750
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dual band</font>

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:41,760
AVGN wireless for gigabit ports mass

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,250
storage firewall VPN<font color="#CCCCCC"> more everything but</font>

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,589
then it have the ipv6 well it wasn't in

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> manual and it wasn't in the web</font>

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,030
interface but good people at linksys or

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,930
linksys by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco as i should say as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,899
last week they had some good ideas at

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,229
least premises were good we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,330
deploy ipv6 worldwide a lot of ice bees

22
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,780
don't support it yet to the edge so

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:14,100
let's help out a little no mistakes

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:18,470
there so what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> they come up with and</font>

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:22,310
this is where it starts sliding a bit

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:25,830
that's when ipv6 on the local network

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,490
let's use 6 24 in the router firmware

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,820
and do routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertise a router</font>

29
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,460
advertisement<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the local network how</font>

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,270
did I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out I switched on v6 on</font>

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,009
my laptop and it worked where it wasn't

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:46,530
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to because i hadn't configured</font>

33
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:50,520
v6 anywhere yet so and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,909
had 64 and it was not firewall or VPN or

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,039
anything so basically everything behind

36
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,520
my Wi-Fi router and firewall was good

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,219
accessible from the outside world so

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,369
where did it go wrong this wasn't

39
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,190
documented anywhere it wasn't

40
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,878
configurable and it wasn't any way to

41
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,878
switch it up

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,549
yes I could switch the entire wireless

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,280
router off but that wasn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,140
point I really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 300 megabit of</font>

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,540
wireless and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the other duties that</font>

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,549
came with it so I had to live with these

47
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:35,010
packets on my local network and oh

48
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:38,880
here's a here's the wireshark capture so

49
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,829
v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> in consumer devices it's great but um</font>

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,980
how it really how do we do it I mean I

51
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:50,560
tried to to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to linksys customer</font>

52
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:55,268
support about this is a what native v6

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,160
and my house was broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried doing a</font>

54
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:01,299
tunnel proper native he<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 on my network</font>

55
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,700
but no and even though v6 can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug</font>

56
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:07,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and play in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 config please make it</font>

57
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,910
configurable so on there's a course an

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,840
additional slide since i'm a geek and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

59
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,430
couldn't live with this how I fixed it

60
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,940
this might actually be more interesting

61
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,739
even so how do you do this when it's not

62
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,370
documented anywhere well fortunately

63
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:28,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">linksys has open source software so use</font>

64
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,130
the source look there's a GPL<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

65
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">tree available if you look here look for</font>

66
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,390
it it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 max download then you</font>

67
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,390
document by using grep

68
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:44,750
and hidden in a web page on the web

69
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,660
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> called system dot ASP was an</font>

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,470
internal variable on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web page which</font>

71
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,390
had v6 in the name somewhere and the

72
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:59,359
actual physical man for that was vista

73
00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:04,820
premium so what you did was you disable

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:07,850
vista premium reboot problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve if</font>

75
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:11,390
this confuses you you are not alone but

76
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:14,390
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time this happens i think i</font>

77
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:17,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some food for thought so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

78
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,700
the proper way of doing p6 in devices

79
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,640
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I appreciate the effort</font>

80
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,570
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaks is put in but I don't</font>

81
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,310
appreciate them not finishing it so what

82
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,610
do you think how should we do this I

83
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,640
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> 624 as a feature in boxes like</font>

84
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:38,180
this is a nifty feature it does get in

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:42,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way if you start deploying v6 as an</font>

86
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:45,800
ISP and if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer is anybody but</font>

87
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,200
me you're likely to get calls from your

88
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers about wifey 6 is not working</font>

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,510
whereas you didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong so</font>

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,510
any thoughts on that

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:10,590
mark up all right next up next time if

92
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you buy a ruder gold me because I could</font>

93
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,780
have warned you buy this one and well

94
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:20,760
it's actually observation which you

95
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:23,700
already might and might break few a few

96
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,940
non-disclosure<font color="#CCCCCC"> share but somebody</font>

97
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,670
explain to me it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

98
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,700
requirement to boot that little ready

99
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:36,270
for vista sticker on the box to support

100
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:41,849
64 and that might explain why it's

101
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:44,090
called vista premium as an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

102
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,010
sure if it's true<font color="#CCCCCC"> that come from a</font>

103
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,619
well-known fender<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this was the guys</font>

104
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:53,190
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to put vista ready for vista</font>

105
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,600
on your box<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tooth support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 624 and</font>

106
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:00,870
that's why it's in there that is

107
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,060
interesting thank you hi i'm broke again

108
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,430

112
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:17,159
installed dd-wrt and and the thing is DD

113
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,940
our our<font color="#E5E5E5"> team the new version is has no</font>

119
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,289
know the image but and you and you have

120
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,020
to enable the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pv6 do a bunch of copy and</font>

paste etc find out said and I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

122
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,419
I realize you work but my isp has this

123
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,780
great idea of changing my IP address

124
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,150
every 12 hours so my 624 was working

125
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,099
great for a couple of hours then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

126
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,590
not working and actually it was terrible

127
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,740
because I see how they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised then</font>

128
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,260
you know for 2012 exam didn't match my

129

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:11,640
interface you see we were having issues

134
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,890
with the home devices yeah well that's

135
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly the road I didn't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,290
trying to recover so I didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

was shipped with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 function and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

146

<font color="#CCCCCC">Amy enabled by default on apart at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 43 it</font>

147
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:54,470
doesn't have a vb6 firewall and us home

148
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:59,120
run security complained about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that which</font>

149
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:03,260
is too Punk to do that and a couple

150
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,470
people came to IDF and they turned that

151
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:09,409
policy and change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that portion they I</font>

152
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:14,200
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are simply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the firewall</font>

153

<font color="#CCCCCC">IP based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 function enabled</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks</font>

154
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:22,520
Wes<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> occurs better I have bad news</font>

155
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:25,820
it's your fault every why is that well

156
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,370
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting there okay the problem is is</font>

157
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,409
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a market driven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Society pay</font>

158
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,539
for bells and whistles long before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

159
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,400
pay for management interfaces and

160
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,159
configurability and all sorts of other

161
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,468
stuff so you know when we have this

162
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,909
tendency and I fall into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camp but</font>

163
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:42,289
when we have the tendency to go buy all

164
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,360
the new features with the new bells and

165
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,040
whistles you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know somewhere marketing in</font>

166
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,220
all these companies make these decisions

167
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,380
of well should i deploy you know this

168
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,880
new option and it may not be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> option</font>

169
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,050
you wanted purchase you know you may

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,360
have purchased it for some other reason

171
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,150
but they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to market as many new</font>

172
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,460
features as they can get and so as we

173
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,770
all know the manageability of all those

174
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,060
features comes much much later

175
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,310
especially if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

176
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,010
management so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is the</font>

177
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:13,459
interesting bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree with you that</font>

178
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:17,240
we're as the consumers are at fault but

179
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,430
if if your tray default was correct then

180
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,470
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have expected fonts font size at</font>

181
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,390
least this tall on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said it</font>

182
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,700
would support ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it would have</font>

183
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,689
this size of phones in the manual about

184
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,540
how it supports v6 it is in crown

185
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,400
when it's new and it hadn't have it

186
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,990
doesn't have feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> six that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

187
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alat point you're absolutely right</font>

188
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:40,410
my second comment would be then<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

189
