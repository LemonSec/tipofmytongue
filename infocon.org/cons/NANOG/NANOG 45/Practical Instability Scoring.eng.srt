00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:09,680
so next is Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hoey with our Renesys up</font>

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,680
next

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,599
hey y'all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim Kelly for Renesys i'm</font>

4
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,040
here today to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,040
uncomfortable truths of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,320
it's been known<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some time it's</font>

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,329
caused some concern that a very small

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">minority of all the prefixes in a full</font>

9
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,780
DFC table<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually contribute a very</font>

10
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,399
large portion of the instability that we

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,420
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp updates that</font>

12
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,519
are exchanged it may be as small as<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,680
percent and then each day and they may

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,979
be contributing 50 or even sixty percent

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,910
of the total<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP traffic and it's been</font>

16
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,560
some speculation about where those are

17
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,910
what I'm gonna do today is show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,950
experiments that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing over</font>

19
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,369
the last couple of months looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

20
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">last year of traffic trying to figure</font>

21
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:31,080
out what these unstable prefixes have in

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,130
common and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to cut to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the chase we</font>

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,320
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not uniformly</font>

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,500
distributed and in fact what they have

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,598
in common<font color="#CCCCCC"> is their transit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Transit</font>

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,800
PATH both the origin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people</font>

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,360
upstream so what we're going to do is

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:48,630
propose some simple methods for scoring

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,259
any of your guesses according to the

30
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,580
stability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your customer cone and so</font>

31
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,679
you need to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because you may be in</font>

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk we're going to call you out</font>

33
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,940
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite XKCD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font>

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,200
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little Renesys guy</font>

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,539
stick figure is standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,810
blackboard he says our relationship

37
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:11,489
entered its decline at this point and

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,080
the nanog community<font color="#CCCCCC"> off-screen says</font>

39
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,330
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you started graphing</font>

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,900
everything and he says<font color="#CCCCCC"> well that's just</font>

41
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,220
a coincidence so<font color="#CCCCCC"> why do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care why do</font>

42
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,230
we care about route change maybe we've

43
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">been looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this for Renesys has</font>

44
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,099
been looking at it for eight years or

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,629
nine years here's why we care right

46
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,940
every time obviously you know this every

47
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:32,700
time a route changes you get the

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,280
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> for packet delay or reordering</font>

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,780
or even loss and if that<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes</font>

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,769
significant than users somewhere are

51
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,180
going to notice they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font>

52
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,260
trace routes and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,660
what users do they're going to blame you

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,390
even if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not at fault you're</font>

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,040
providing transit to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font>

56
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,768
not maintaining stable presence in

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,078
table if this gets really significant

58
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,390
and because you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's Dave Meyer</font>

59
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,700
pointed out earlier in the control plane

60
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,339
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in band so if routing</font>

61
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,409
change gets really bad your router's get

62
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,120
hot in sessions get reset and then it

63
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,489
gets worse if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets really really</font>

64
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,980
significant then we all get to discover

65
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,480
what a power saw power-law size

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,530
distribution needs for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet events</font>

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,090
right complex distributed highly

68
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,069
connected organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

69
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,170
failure modes that look like a bell

70
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,849
curve you know the probability of very

71
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,730
large events doesn't fall to zero very

72
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:27,000
rapidly you know the Roman Empire was

73
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:30,959
too big to fall too big to fail Lehman

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,609
Brothers was too big<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fail tier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

75
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,150
backbone providers routing

76
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,620
infrastructure is too big to fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

77
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,909
instead of focusing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP update rates</font>

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,139
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole table as we have before or</font>

79
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,388
less as I said let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

80
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:45,079
subset that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are consistently poor and as</font>

81
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:49,349
I say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look about 1%</font>

82
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:52,199
that's that's thousands of prefixes out

83
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,970
of 250 or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand break today are</font>

84
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,909
generating more than half the BGP update

85
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,290
traffic every day so what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do</font>

86
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,000
is we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna identify the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

87
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,739
are unstable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were stable if</font>

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,970
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the unstable people we</font>

89
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,620
claim that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability is kind of a</font>

90
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,299
surrogate measurement for the qualities

91
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,949
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would look for if you were</font>

choosing a customer or peer choosing me

93
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do business with you know people who</font>

94
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,668
are stable have good infrastructure they

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,829
have clue full admin's take care of

96

problems quickly they engineer in

97
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,560
advance of problems they give you quiet

<font color="#CCCCCC">enjoyment of your relationship with them</font>

99
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,650
now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the other</font>

100
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">people first of all you know I'm</font>

fundamental research on BGP and

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,680
stability as you know sessions go up and

105
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,199
down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and down because everything</font>

106
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,169
dies all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has this wonderful</font>

107
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,970
multiplicative property that one network

108
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,320
going out can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be perceived locally</font>

109
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,770
depending on how rich you're peering is

110
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,000
this hundreds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> echoes because not only</font>

111
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,109
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply getting the withdrawal</font>

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the network you're getting the path</font>

114
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,250
could have been going to that Network

115
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,599
are going to come back at you right it's

116
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,639
been thought for a while that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

117
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,330
be flapped Anthony it turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

118
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,870
harmful

119
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,758
mean sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it caused instability</font>

120
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,840
to get damp down quick but then in the

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,900
long run it really prolong the

122
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,619
convergence time so practically what

123
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,258
we're going to do is we're going to

124
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,509
assign scores and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propose</font>

125
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,520
one way y'all can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own thoughts</font>

126
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:19,259
on this and construct competing measures

127
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,419
but here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> strawman measure that we're</font>

128
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,949
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use we're actually going to</font>

129
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,688
score every a s what we're going to do

130
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,210
is take its customer cone everybody

131
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:30,960
who's on net with it measure their

132
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,729
instability calculator percentage assign

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,710
you a score<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

134
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,750
for bragging rights you can tease each

135
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:41,430
other you could issue new exotic

136
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:43,349
derivative securities based on them pays

137
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,889
off based on you you nuts instability in

138
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:49,469
February don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've had enough</font>

139
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:56,330
of that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually made that joke in in</font>

140
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:59,009
October it's not funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore so</font>

141
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">stability scoring is quite difficult it</font>

142
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,969
takes a large data set you've got to

143
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,409
look across a huge peer set everything

144
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:07,440
is non-stationary you have to look over

145
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:09,150
long periods of time the blame is<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

146
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,460
at the edge it could be here in the core

147
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,690
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be anywhere in between and and</font>

148
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,919
frankly everybody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

149
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,690
instability because the more prefixes

150
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> route the more instabilities you're</font>

151
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,580
going to see this is a good kind of a

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,849
difficult plot I'll take a second just

153
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">to to go over it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a</font>

154
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:27,120
probability distribution curve about

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,360
corner it says look a hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

157
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:33,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the routing table is going to have at</font>

158
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,940
least 0% instability that is it's going

159
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least not stable I mean not</font>

160
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,639
unstable and then this falls off right

161
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,680
this is a log-log plot that says that

162
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,440
maybe ten percent of the table the worst

163
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,949
ten percent is going to be unstable for

164
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,479
more than a hundred minutes in the

165
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,180
sample period here with october two

166
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,740
thousand eight and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just keeps falling</font>

167
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,379
right the worst one percent had a

168
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,599
thousand minutes of instability the

169
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,789
worst tenth of a percent head and so

170
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,940
forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

171
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:08,159
and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on and this is the bitterest</font>

172
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,180
part of the curve down here I take a

173
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,680
minute to explain that cuz we're going

174
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,240
to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> this apart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in two different</font>

175
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,620
subpopulations we're going to see if

176
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,580
they have sort of visibly this

177
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,639
same distribution so the theories we

178
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,469
looked at were age so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it true that</font>

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the longer prefix has been in the table</font>

180
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe prefixes that survive in the table</font>

181
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">get more stable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outsider length</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe /</font>

182
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:35,250
Bates maybe classful prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> flap less</font>

183
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,850
maybe they flap more geography or

184
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,460
transit so first of all just to rule it

185
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,169
out age does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not imply stability I</font>

apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the red green that the</font>

global table and various dates in time

190
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,720
the big outlier at the left is everybody

191
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,150
before 2002 and the curve down below is

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very end where you'll see only</font>

196
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,289

which is my seat<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pants way of</font>

telling you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same kind</font>

see that on the right side this just

keeps going right there are

223

there are significant numbers of

let's find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right here's my score</font>

230
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,800
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a definition of impacted</font>

231
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:54,220
so you take any prefix in the routing

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,748
table and<font color="#CCCCCC"> well come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a decision</font>

233
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,360
about whether it has been impacted in a

234
00:09:55,749 --> 00:10:01,180
given our here's my definition I say if

235
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,149
I saw that prefix get withdrawn at any

into some of these stories we're going

285
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,640
to tell as I say there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven day</font>

286
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:09,320
cycle here is that seven day cycle if

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,250
you take instability the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> series and</font>

288
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,240
you wrap it around seven day clock

the right we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue about whether</font>

295
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,729
that's traffic because it's the diurnal

296
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:34,250
cycle of traffic or whether it's your

297
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:36,470
working hours you'll see that if you

298
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,000
take the top 20 a esas worldwide the key

299
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,930
does not correspond to the height of the

300
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,060

of the top 20 it's pretty stable you

303
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,880
know for each provider there is a

305
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,220
it's not as if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you go up and down</font>

306
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,529
that's because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest a esas have</font>

307
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,540
very large customer bases and so if you

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:59,630
I've taken the percentage instability in

331
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,750
kind of a scatter plot and you see two

332
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,250
things pop out at you immediately one is

333

<font color="#CCCCCC">instability level for these providers</font>

335
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,209
towards the bottom and it's pretty low

336
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:22,070
right consistently under one percent

337
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:25,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the a ranking there's also</font>

moments of call them bursts of failure

339
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,430
right where instability can jump for

feature that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see here at the right</font>

of the cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut in the Mediterranean</font>

346
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,640
now this is again an important point to

347
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,110
realize I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying that teller globe</font>

348
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,640
caused this instability that would be

349
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,680
the farthest thing that I from what I

350
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,970
want you to conclude what I'm saying is

351
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:03,170
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> telugu observed some customers who</font>

352
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:05,240
had impact they became unstable now tell

353
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,459
a globe worked heroically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get those</font>

354
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,710
guys back on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their feet and to improve</font>

355
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,350
capacity and to make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be stable</font>

356
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in the future we can anticipate that</font>

357
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,750
their customer base will be more stable

358
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,400
but during this event as we measured<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

359
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,260
they and everybody else who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is upstream</font>

360
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,310
of those will have the same impact on

361
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,569
their stability score so if you compare

362
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,130
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you can claim a winner</font>

363
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really close I think there's only</font>

364
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,689
four tenths of a percent separating the

365
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,220
two and so you might almost give the win

366
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,040
to tell the globe Tata given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

367
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,260
have a more adventurous global customer

head-to-head battle between these two

373
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,640
which is artificial tilia would have 150

web 49.4 you know so very evenly matched

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:10,699
the next one up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up illustrate yes</font>

377
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:13,610
sir on a previous slide hadn't you said

378
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:15,439
the cable failures yes right so go back

379
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that site you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that oh yeah that big</font>

that disproportionately impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64-53 it</font>

382
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,129
did indeed so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were taken out</font>

383
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:26,990
what would those percentages be under

384
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:28,339
different the same the score here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

385
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,499
think I neglected to mention on the

386
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,149
slide where I proposed it we take all of

387
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:33,980
the instability scores for all of the

388
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:36,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the period and we do a 95 5</font>

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I forgot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually a</font>

390
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,040

understand bursting and you understand

making people pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their worst first</font>

393
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:50,029
we take 95 5 and so yes if this event

394
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">were out I'm not sure it was a pretty</font>

395
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,749
sharp event as you can see it's a pretty

396
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:56,748
<font color="#CCCCCC">short spiked and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes if you took that</font>

397

399
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:07,668
they could be wonderful thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

clarification so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is AT&T vs</font>

401
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,600

402
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,490
compare the two other than for

entertainment value mean they're both X

404

you see here<font color="#E5E5E5"> again lower is better and</font>

the brown is<font color="#CCCCCC"> China Telecom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> china telecom</font>

409
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,139
stable or I shouldn't say they are more

410
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,110
stable their customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're on net</font>

411
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,240
customers are more stable but they have

412
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">more sporadic failure so one of the</font>

413
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,549
interesting things that we as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

414
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,380
community have to work out is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

415
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,539
weight do we put on average our

instability versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> peak hour instability</font>

417
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:47,929
I give the win here to AT&T because in

418
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:52,220
the 95 5 measurement AT&T pulls in 99.1

<font color="#CCCCCC">6 which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an a china telecom in 98 11</font>

420
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,360
because they do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> bursts similar to</font>

421
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,980
what Todd was pointing out in the cable

<font color="#E5E5E5">cut slide china telecom is more stable</font>

423
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,590

<font color="#E5E5E5">get their share of the whoa yes sprint</font>

557
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,600

558
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:34,549
little spike there at the moment of the

big triple cable cut sprint being being

560
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:40,309
larger has a more diverse global

should you care about these numbers

572
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,350
uniformly distributed across everybody

573
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,970
and it's just a fact of life and you

574
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,770
have to get on with it no there are

575
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,530
actually providers in the world whose

576
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:23,139
prefixes contribute a disproportionate

577
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,360
share to the instability of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global</font>

578
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,730
table and every router in the world pays

579
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,469
that instability tax in terms of the

580
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,660
load<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the router and the time to</font>

581
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,460
convergence and everything else and so

582
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,140
as a community I would suggest that it's

583
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with some metrics if not</font>

these metrics than other ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

585
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,229
would propose go out take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

data sets go to go to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to route views</font>

587
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,480
go to write find find data sets that

00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,670
cover over long periods of time large

589
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,180
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of peers and figure out for</font>

590
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:53,140
yourself who you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on net customers are</font>

591
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,030
whether they're your customers

592
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,160
immediately or your customers customers

593
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,230
customers who are contributing

594
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,680
disproportionately to route instability

595
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,540
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this should be considered sort</font>

596
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,600
of a tragedy of the Commons that people

597
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:10,060
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pollute the daily table with</font>

with instability the only way<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

599
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to measure it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to manage it</font>

600
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,510
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it and I think that</font>

00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm really interested in hearing more</font>

602
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:23,200
people talk about identifying the people

603
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,940
who are doing good jobs at identifying

604
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,130
their customers who are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> unstable</font>

605
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,470
tracking them down and helping them

606
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,030
rising clue to the point where they

607
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,210
don't make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so miserable for</font>

608
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,860
everybody else we can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that if</font>

609
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,390
we start talking about it and we get

610
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,310
some concrete objective metrics out

611
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,050
there maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the point</font>

612
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:43,120
where an enlightened customer who comes

613
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you can say I took a look at your</font>

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,750
your network I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that with</font>

615
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,030
you because the people who you have on

616
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,820
net are significantly more<font color="#E5E5E5"> stable than</font>

617
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,139
the people who your competitors do even

618
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,899
though maybe they're charging a cheaper

619
00:26:53,140 --> 00:27:00,010
rate can we hope for that as a point of

620
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:02,820
differentiation so thanks that's all I

621
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,820
have I'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

622
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,600
controversy questions criticism

623
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:23,590
hoping this pointed sticks here that day

624
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:27,310
cycle thing those are days where is that

625
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">days UTC it was Daisy OTC on the plot</font>

626
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,310
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspect this at some length</font>

627
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,610
because these slides will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up later on</font>

628
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:36,159
the Renesys site<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

629
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,469
this the peaks of those sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

630
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,510

631
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,930
signal is really broad because you're

632
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:46,930
lumping together work days from from

633
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:50,230
Europe from Middle East from Asia from

634
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:52,870
North America it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in North America</font>

635
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:55,090
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what you'd expect but they</font>

636
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:58,000
always miss I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is UTC but</font>

637
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:00,820
there is it but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a genuine day</font>

638
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,400
of the week correlated instability cycle

639
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,679
that corresponds to the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

640
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,370
of stability being Friday Saturday

641
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,020
Sunday UTC it's actually it's late

642
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:15,639
Friday into Saturday Sunday and then

643
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:17,440
leaking into Monday UTC I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> as hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

644
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">me to explain i looked at that i thought</font>

645
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,130
maybe i calculated it wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did it six</font>

646
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:25,420
times maybe you guys you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> come to</font>

647
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">work on monday and you're like oh i</font>

648
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:32,920
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to touch routers</font>

649
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:34,840
today or don't know hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey Jim Donnie</font>

650
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:39,040
with peak web consulting thank you very

651
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,959
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> your if I'm reading this correctly</font>

652
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,850
you're holding the transit providers

653
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,010
accountable for the behavior of their

654
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:49,120
downstream customers that's unfair isn't

655
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:54,400
it is it unfair is it may be worst case

656
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:57,719
open to sabotage that's a nice point I

657
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,670
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has more to do with the</font>

658
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,940
blend of customers that you have right I

659
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:05,020
think even a single customer going bad

660
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,230
would it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hard to move the</font>

661
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,790
needle on a big carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I could be</font>

662
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,820
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fertile ground</font>

663
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,889
from sabotage their leader and rush<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

664
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">right then is it it's a is it is it</font>

665
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,130
immediate down<font color="#E5E5E5"> streams or is that all</font>

666
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,240
the downstream following<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all the</font>

667
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:23,710
way down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bitter end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it is</font>

668
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,540
fundamentally unfair on the face of it

669
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,280
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why if I haven't issued this</font>

670
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,409
disclaimer enough I'll do it three more

671
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,149
times I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the quality</font>

of backbone

quality of your gear or your people or

675
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,770
anything I'm just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">population of people that these guys</font>

00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:48,810

682
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,909
we doubt whether or not it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quality</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average closing customer next to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">average sprint customer and think of the</font>

expertise behind that network right to

00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,260
try to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey is this they don't</font>

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,790

690
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,170
they're more likely to take their target

00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,970
work offline for maintenance they don't

692
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:20,850
have any redundancy within their network

693
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:23,130
right versus a sprint customer who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

694
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:26,370
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely to and then when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that aside from normalizing the number</font>

697
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:34,500
such as you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amit in that case</font>

698
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,630
perhaps it's more a sprint problem than

699
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sprint problem and a downstream</font>

potentially be more downstream customer

problem right and there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

703
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,840
of a blame the victim quality smell to

704
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,970
these numbers right because you're

705
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,250
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh if you are not if</font>

have more instability which is it means

709
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,670
demonstrably true right you get the

710
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:01,290
little guys the people who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

seen as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many really unusual cases so</font>

714
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:13,050
they can't respond quickly so they make

<font color="#E5E5E5">things worse and it is your right and</font>

716
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:17,639
it's very much a function of the

717

picked the 95th percentile that's I

734

seeing that ninety percent flapping very

00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,350
very badly the one percent is just noise

744

right when you're at ninety percent

749

you're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending data out and not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're clueless yes doesn't affect that</font>

transit provider did you have lots of

763
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:54,899
caveats in the data but mostly I'm

764
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:56,998
wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> why did you pick night p 95 p</font>

765
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:58,289

said what I meant when I said 95 5

768
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:05,009
you're right I did not do systematic

769
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:08,639
exploration to find the sweet spot at

770
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:10,049
which it would make a difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> I by</font>

771
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:12,240
your intuition that ninety percent might

772
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:14,340
be a better cut off well actually I

773
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">think a better cut off is you know one</font>

774
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,269
hundred percent fine you know even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

775
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:19,499
they have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big spike that's very</font>

776
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:21,749
interesting because that's where the

777
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:24,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">global routing table isn't most impacted</font>

778
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,679
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> also be how much time it might</font>

779
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:27,119
be better actually to have multiple

780
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">numbers you know if we're working on</font>

781
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,168
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one number that it has a filter to</font>

782
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:33,418
take out the short spikes and another

783
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:36,149
filter which which allows the spikes to

784
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,470
stand because they're there are prefixes

785
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:39,418
that that you're right just they just

786
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,860
trip over a power cord and they're gone

787

<font color="#CCCCCC">and then they come back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they're</font>

788
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,389
fine for two years there's another

separate or maybe you have and I just

00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:48,190
you mentioned earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the sound of</font>

echo is worse right if they're well

819
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:04,569
situated let's say yeah I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

820
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,058
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> related to Patrick's question</font>

858
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,038

say that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm not saying it</font>

860
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,680

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there probably is a</font>

863
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,269
population of people out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

864
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,890
vulnerable and yet we're trying their

865
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:43,500
best and so very out-of-the-way places

866
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,808
to be on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet with diverse</font>

867
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,609
transit I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should be applauded</font>

868
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:49,470
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to recognize them and</font>

869
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:50,848
maybe get them some help well they want

870
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,200
to be GP because that's what all the big

871

872
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,019

they<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you their own players and</font>

875
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,490
other hand I think your numbers are

876
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,529
showing that some of the pretty bad job

877
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:03,000
of that what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> transit sun</font>

878
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:05,069
transits sales teams would love to sell

879
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,660
more sort of captive customers and say

880
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:08,190

wandered onto the net who did get bgp to

886
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,910
just get some advice and if these

887
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,220
numbers should let us identify these

888
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,200
sort of vulnerable populations and get

889
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,799
some word to them maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even get them to</font>

892
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:36,710
