I'm presenting on half of myself brew

from a router or other network equipment

buffering too much data so it's

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,009
basically we've got big buffers out

24
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:10,130
there on particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on end equipment</font>

25
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,810
and that's gonna as we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them as</font>

26
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,250
I'll discuss on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,620
lead to some interesting phenomena that

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,810
we want to try in not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:21,500
phenomena and we want to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> steps</font>

30
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to address it memory prices as we know</font>

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,530

<font color="#E5E5E5">dropping down significantly and uh we've</font>

33
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:35,030
been employing big buffers in our end

there and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a common theme for</font>

38
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,100
both vendors when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to sell</font>

39
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,900

as they're trying to make competitive

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,710
service offerings talking about try to

42
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,260
get the highest throughput you know we

whatever the number is going to be um

45
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,470
employing large buffer is particularly

46
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:06,169
in the end equipment helps to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

47
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,910
up so why do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to care about this</font>

48
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,120
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that throughput I</font>

49
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,010
mean that's you see it not every advert

50
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,180
for whoever your ISPs are providing

51
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,399
competitive service they're always

52
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,210

56
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,730
there on the commercials it it does get

57
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,070
you that number so you get to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

58
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,380
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> cutting ceiling where the you know</font>

59
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:37,850
best in the top line but it comes as a

60
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,799
cost because the additional latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

61
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,890
are introduced as packets are idling in

<font color="#CCCCCC">the buffer waiting for transmission so</font>

63
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,700
if you liked if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of say</font>

64
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,700
in the upstream direction we're doing a

got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these deep buffers that the file</font>

71
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,520
going to fill that<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna</font>

72
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,680
drop anything because we want to try and

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">maximize that throughput and keep that</font>

74

TCP window open but then the packets for

75
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,220
the interactive applications are sitting

76
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,859
there waiting their turn and

77
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,680
transmission that expresses itself is

78
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,420
latency to the end application and if

79
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,160
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that application that</font>

mitigation correction techniques out

82
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,000
there on that but there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

83
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,440
you can do on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time application</font>

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,940
before you start experiencing the

customer has bad experience whether it's

87
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,540
lags talk about a laggy game so you know

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,920
that's the drawback when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

89
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">having large buffers in the end device</font>

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,309
this phenomena can happen either in the

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:58,940
upstream direction or in the downstream

92
00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:00,800
direction or in both directions so back

93
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,380
in the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of residential</font>

94
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,410
residential internet usage is way way

95
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,600
back we now the typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up an</font>

96
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,020
experience was you've got your modem or

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,060
DSL cable modem dsl router just one port

98
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,760
coming off of that going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your one</font>

99

whatever activity was typically if it

102
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,610
was something throughput intensive we

103
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,030
got going for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best throughput</font>

highest throughput they have

good or good enough experience out there

they were the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was this</font>

107
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,799
you know about Internet experience well

that all was well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and good one was one</font>

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,599
over yeah that's breaks the mindset and

120
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,250
methodology that was sent in place when

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,240
we're doing these large buffers and the

122
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,830
end devices ah and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know when</font>

123
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,630
you're experiencing latency your gaming

124
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,609
lag that's really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know a</font>

125
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:24,820
bummer experience so what's been done

126
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the acronym ATM stands</font>

127
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,469
for adaptive queue management software

128
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:34,780
algorithms and they're basically trying

129
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:36,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop packets out of the buffer to</font>

130
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,250
minute to strike a balance while

131
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,010
minimizing latency but also still

132
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,010
maximizing throughput you could take it

133
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,500
to you know a tuning parameter to do it

134
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,330
and make things wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for latency</font>

135
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,720
but then you wind up taking a dramatic

136
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,789
hit and throughput again the situation

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,740
we're trying to correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISM get some</font>

138
00:05:54,789 --> 00:06:00,070
good experience on latency with

minimizing the the latency and trying to

140
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,630
get good throughput on that some of the

141
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,570

180
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,729
raw what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis so the acronym there</font>

181
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,930
is the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> over cable system interface</font>

182
00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:00,120
specification it's the set of interests

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,550
specifications from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable industry</font>

184
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,339
that finds the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 packet</font>

185
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,009
encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a layer 1 physical</font>

186
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:11,110
medium transmission over the coaxial

187
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:15,939
copper cable so that set of standards

188
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:18,729
covers that part of the stat the when

189
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:21,369
you're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis 20 docsis 30 doctors</font>

190
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:24,008
31 the key takeaway<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that is that</font>

191
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:27,789
increasing a higher transmission rates

192
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,769
when we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis 20 compared to</font>

193
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,839
doc says 10 they increase the channel

194
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:35,620
width they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a 3.2 mega hertz</font>

195
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:38,620
channel wide channel to a 6.4 megahertz

196
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,688
wide channel and then when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> docsis 30</font>

197
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,060
came out they<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced channel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bonding</font>

198
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">across the 6.4 megahertz channels so</font>

199
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,660
that you get again higher throughput

200
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,250
higher transmission rates and then

201
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,120
finally what's happening now with docsis

202
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,430
31

203
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,010
they're introducing OFDM technology

204
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,599
annals to again try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and increase the</font>

205
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,970
usage of the spectrum to get more

206
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,740
throughput um<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight UN's they're not</font>

207
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,450
particularly dependent on<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctors but in</font>

208
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of managing this through the</font>

209
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,190
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how to get it work with our</font>

210
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,110
vendors and get this deployed the cable

211
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,270
industry linked it up with the docsis

212
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,360
three one standard again there's nothing

213
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,860
that's you know it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> aqm and doc says</font>

214
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,210
31<font color="#CCCCCC"> or tied together but it was an</font>

inflection<font color="#CCCCCC"> point where we were doing</font>

216
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,710
changes to the requirements and change

217
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:28,690
the specifications so it was a good fit

218
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put that in there at that point so</font>

219
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:36,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">how do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this field trial so when we</font>

220
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,920
talk about I on a particular modem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

221
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:42,370
we have deployed in our network we were

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,240
able to adjust the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable modem buffer</font>

223
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,550
size in fixed values the only the

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,670
upstream buffer was able to be adjusted

225
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,880
and the default was from the vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

226
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:57,150
in 96 kilobyte deep buffer we have been

227
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,570
done in addition to taking baseline

228
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:03,970
measurements at the 96 k we kb we also

229
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,300
worked down to 48 kilobyte and eat

230
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,790
kilobyte buffer sizes to basically see

231
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,040
what the effects and impacts was this

232
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,260
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to mitigate the</font>

233
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,620
buffer bloatware we were having you good

234
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:20,170
throughput but not so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> latency we</font>

235
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,240
had enlisted whole bunch of our existing

236
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,000
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to host the modems in their</font>

237
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,050

<font color="#E5E5E5">their the modem they were using with a</font>

239
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,189
regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet service so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we sent them</font>

240
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,800
another modem and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a banana pie</font>

241
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,150
where we had to have them hook it up

242
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,719
through the ethernet port of that and

243
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,100
run testing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the banana pie and it</font>

244
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,930
was all automated they didn't have to do

245
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,060
anything they basically said it plug it

246
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:46,180
all in get it set up and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

247
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,529
lights came on we had a test<font color="#CCCCCC"> suite that</font>

248
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">would basically run and I'll talk about</font>

249
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,510
that in a moment and the results are

250
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:57,100
basically just uh SCPD back to our

251
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:58,930
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok wait a minute I was just</font>

252
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about ATMs and I was talking</font>

about pie and<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis</font>

254
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,519
everyone and added to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

255
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:06,380
true and that's all where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to go</font>

256
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,810
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time we were doing this</font>

257
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,149
experiment in the early part of the year

258
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:13,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">the docsis 31 modems were not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

259
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:16,459
yet so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do something</font>

260
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">and see if these buff in general if the</font>

261
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:21,138
buffer blog mitigation techniques would

262
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,209
work they hadn't been we haven't

263
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,250
received 31 modems and we hadn't done

264
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:27,529
any work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on the 30 modems for</font>

265
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,360
the atms and that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this I'll</font>

266
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,769
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a static buffer management we</font>

talking about adjusting the buffer<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

268
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:39,079
fixed size it so what do we do in the

269
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:42,500
field trial we're using a test<font color="#CCCCCC"> suite</font>

check so that's the wording behind our

280
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,860
rul I list the links there if you want

unidirectional latency checks while

287
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,610
doing the unidirectional throughput run

we've just set it off<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run at</font>

00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular times of the day that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

291
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,490
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we didn't</font>

292
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,670
have to intervene manually for the test

293
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:42,290
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it downstream latency under load</font>

294
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,000
separate from upstream latency under

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,189
load we were not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it all</font>

296
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,810
together we still don't see that model

297
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:50,300
where upstream and downstream are

298
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,099
utilized fully at the scene<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in our</font>

299
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,620
footprint so we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just kind</font>

300
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,850
of contain and bound some of the

301
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:01,819
variables that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at in this</font>

302
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:03,889
trial so we're how do we do this again

303
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:07,670
we're running three times a day we did

304
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:10,880
eight noon and 5pm all UTC time and

305
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,030
that's across<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the probes so</font>

306
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,040
regardless of geography where the

307
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,319
probe was in our network for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trial</font>

308
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,560
participant was running at the same time

309
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,650
of the day so in the east of the probes

310
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,189
that we had out there for example noon

311
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:31,240
is 7am because<font color="#E5E5E5"> East Coast is minus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 off</font>

312
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:35,410
at UTC while in the on the west coast it

313
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,940
was minus that 53 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the morning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

314
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,480
in the morning further I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're 8</font>

315
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,250
off of UTC I got the math right on that

316
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,870
but we're running them uniformly at the

317
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,000
same time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't we were not trying</font>

320
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,630
week we were changing the buffer size so

321
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:59,079
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about the three sizes of 96 kb</font>

322
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:00,370
48 kb and eight we'd set the modem reset

323
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,980
it you know set up with a particular

324
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,780
value make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the modem took the</font>

325
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,600
change and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then left it alone for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a week</font>

326
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,189
to run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> test then the second week</font>

327
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,620
would change down to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> buffer</font>

328
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,810
size same deal reset the modem make sure

329
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,460
it all took let that run for<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

330
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,979
week and then finally the third week of

331
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,720
the scene when we talk about these

332
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,970
throughput tests that were generated by

333
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,680
net perf they're all run into a

334
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,960
centrally located server in west chester

335
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,699
PA so again the East Coast and West

336
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,180
Coast and central part of the country

337
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,760
probes were all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same server</font>

338
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,530
we had worked with about 50 people but

339
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,730
due to some equipment problems and some

340
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,189

344
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what were the metrics we were looking</font>

00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:05,140
the mean of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the udm soon again UDP ping</font>

350
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,900
metrics we were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a statistical</font>

351

contract referred to as<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent Delta</font>

352
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:17,380
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means is that it is a and</font>

353
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:20,620

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:39,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Monday test run on week one we would</font>

361
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:42,379
compare that result against the average

362
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,389
of the entire for all the readings for

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,009
up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a percentage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difference on how</font>

366
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:59,329
reading was so how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go about</font>

367
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:01,969
analyzing this data we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> verified</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

368
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:03,949
the three weeks experiment we tried to

369
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,360
do a check that nothing else dramatic

370
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:07,670
was happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the network if there</font>

371
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,899
was any maintenance or anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

372
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,870
the way we do that is we had two

373
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:14,180
additional data sets to compare against

374
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,249
one was from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam news measuring</font>

376
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:21,079

377
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,089
FCC sponsored test where they put

378
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,370
basically a probe in a customer's home

379
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,860
and it's crossed multiple isps that are

380
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,679
doing that so we had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ones</font>

381
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,499
that the comcast customers were running

382
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:35,540
we also had access to the any<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

comcast speed test server customers that

385
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,819
we have that tool out there so customers

386
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:43,069
could take a look at their own data

387
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:44,839
throughput just for their own benefit we

388
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:47,420
looked at those two things and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

389
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:51,019
nothing nothing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were seeing on</font>

396
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:04,520
we did was we had each of the target

405
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,349
the model predictors were the week

406
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:28,669
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the test because we have the</font>

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

412

no differences among the three weeks

413
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,970
then the week should not be a predict

414
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,090
significant predictor for the percent

the downstream latency percent Delta and

427
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,310
one of the benefits of using percent

428

where we had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowest buffer size set</font>

at 8 kilobits<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kilobytes excuse me</font>

446
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,170
the middle blue is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 little bit</font>

kilobyte measurement when the buffer

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,490
size was that and then the ping

449
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,280
perfusion whatever although that is the

450
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,740
was the week<font color="#CCCCCC"> three with the 96 kilobyte</font>

you see that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> box plot there and I had</font>

see that with of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box what that</font>

that box is the 25th percentile reading

the upper box upper line is the 75th

460
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,210

thick black<font color="#CCCCCC"> line in the middle of that</font>

462
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,929

line and half were below when you look

465
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:56,820
at the throughput you see that that eep

466
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,219
for that week<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you see some deviation</font>

467
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,509
off there I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're bouncing between</font>

468
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,669
ranging between 0 and minus twenty

469
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:05,220

472
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:13,710
weeks when you look at the upstream

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,269
latency which is the lower left graph

474
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:20,460
again the right box the brown box shows

475
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:24,179
the range<font color="#CCCCCC"> of links and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that's</font>

476
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,850
down there minus minus 22 minus forty

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,709
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and saying the readings from</font>

479
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,990
that period were between twenty and

481
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,669
leave the probe of that three weeks so

482
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,199
it's kind of telling you something that

483
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:43,590
there's some impact out there on that

484
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,080
and you look at the again at the lower

485
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,418
left chart so with the week one result

486
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,570
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> below the percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> delta had a</font>

negative percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second week</font>

488
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,100
which is the 48 kilobyte buffer size was

489
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:58,139
right about the zero mark so there's it

490
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,480
was little to no deviation on there and

491
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:03,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the third week shows the positive</font>

492
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,190
percent delta which represents<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

493
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:10,250
changes over a latency compared to the

whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> average across the whole period</font>

495
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,850
then as you look at the downstream we

496
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,919
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of deviation across that</font>

497
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:21,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're pretty close to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the zero a</font>

498
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">lie so will this is looking to see we</font>

499
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,110
were starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see things we wanted to</font>

500
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:27,418
see we seeing impact on the upstream in

501
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,070
terms of throughput latency and no one

502
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,840
picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up no impact on the downstream</font>

503
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,439
because we're only making adjustments to

504
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:37,350
the upstream buffer size so what were

505
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,200
the results of this so in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

506
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,168
any form of significant predictor

507
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,059
searing the upload throughput the week

508
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:47,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">to was fourteen percent higher than week</font>

509
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:50,610
14 throughput in<font color="#CCCCCC"> week 3 was fourteen</font>

510
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,679
percent higher than week<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 also the</font>

511
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,510
download

512
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,760
what you saw was just a you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

513
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,470
percent lower than week 1 and week 3 was

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,350
three percent lower than week<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

515
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,090
negligible impact there but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

516
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom line latency which is what we</font>

517
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,070
were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we see week 2 was</font>

518
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,320
twenty-seven percent higher than week 1

519
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,960
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had more latency than</font>

520
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,870
than week<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and then week 3 was</font>

521
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,820
sixty-three percent higher then we want

522
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,000
so the trend<font color="#E5E5E5"> line as you see it is that</font>

523
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:26,990
lower to higher buffer size is trending

524
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,380
an impact on lower to higher latency so

525
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,170
what we were the results of this so none

526
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,910
of the predictors and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> download or</font>

527
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,240
significant for download latency really

528
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,010
no impact on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their we also were able to</font>

529
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,500
see that the day of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the week and the</font>

530
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,550
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the week</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were really not</font>

531
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,980
significant predictors on any of these

532
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,139
as we did the analysis on any of this so

533
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,270
that really just left us with the weeks

534
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,460
the difference between week 1 and week 2

535
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,650
and week 2 and week 3 and comparing

536
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,600
those against each other that's where we

537
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,100
saw the difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that aligns with</font>

538
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,899
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> expectations because again we were</font>

539
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:05,209
changing the buffer size across each of

540
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:07,880
those weeks so what does this tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so</font>

541
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,310
this the upload latency did show the

542
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,790
expected patterns that the increased

543
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:16,490
buffer size was showing higher average

544
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,020
percent delta latency the same numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

545
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,890
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> went through on the prior chart and</font>

546
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,420
that the upload throughput with the week

547
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,520
with the lowest buffer side has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

548
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,760
lowest average percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> delta and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

549
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,500
expect to have some impact in the

550
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,300
upstream throughput is again we're we're

551
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,580
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a trade-off between you</font>

552
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,470
know this fulcrum between throughput and

553
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,110
latency it's kind of like two sides of a

554
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:42,140
seesaw we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit a ideal point</font>

555
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,429
on that and so are the fact that we saw

556
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,350
some impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the throughput in the</font>

557
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:50,180
upstream direction is in line with our

558
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:53,120
expectations so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this all telling</font>

559
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,640
us um so there's there may be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trip</font>

560
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,919
trade-off there but it also doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font>

561
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be linear so if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were to go ahead</font>

562
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do the deployment of this we're kind</font>

563
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,140
of looking at

564
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,890
and say you know really that sweet spot

565
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,680
is that 48 killed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> size so you</font>

566
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">get improvement in the latency but less</font>

567
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,360
of a hit on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the throughput as you would</font>

568
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:18,350
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ek but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again seeing improvement</font>

569
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,850
over the 96 k<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay buffer size so uh you</font>

570
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">know going at that if we're to try and</font>

571
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:27,770
do a large-scale deployment that kind of

572
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:30,440
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be our sweet spot okay so what</font>

573
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,110
happens next we talked about this was

574
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,470
the static buffer size control<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,389
we're going after<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATM which the adaptive</font>

unfortunately the fixed buffer size

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,560
setting the work that we did it's kind

of impractical to do it scaled using if

589
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,970
we had to scale that up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the millions</font>

590
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,189
of subscribers that we had it really

<font color="#E5E5E5">would be impractical impractical because</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a burdensome and had to be done manually</font>

595
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,540
immuno yeah we could automate some of it

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,760
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it still would break some of our</font>

that the CM side is a must<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the CMT s</font>

00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:24,229
we can get somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that because we</font>

620
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,600
do have a large employee base of them

00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:29,499
and maybe there's some impact we can

pretty good on this whole trial and what

00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,700
thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> though is that the buffers</font>

networks interact with the end-to-end

649
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,699
protocol behavior and the early work

650
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:44,700
done on buffer behavior was all about

651
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,200
TCP Reno this holiday<font color="#CCCCCC"> or if most of your</font>

658
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,909
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80s and this was the accepted theory</font>

659
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:05,220
since then<font color="#CCCCCC"> reno is dying a death we've</font>

660
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:08,429
noticed and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's an awful</font>

661
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:11,580
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things like cubic and even other</font>

662
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:14,820
columns of<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP flow control which tend</font>

663
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,699
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be highly delay variation sensitive</font>

664
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,889
and what happens then<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course is when</font>

665
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,659
the buffers start to fill they

00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:24,508
immediately back off in there pacing

quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just change buffer sizes and</font>

00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">the world will alter because the world</font>

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,389
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever thought about instrumenting</font>

into what we do as customers on your

683
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:09,929
we've been looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our along with</font>

we don't have that metric available as

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce that pie we're at you know</font>

689
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,489
we're asking the vendors to give us that

690

and see

692

what how much sizing what's going on in

00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:32,668
there and that use that is you know

on that doing its sender to client

00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:04,109
even worry about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> size of your buffer</font>

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,759
up a an experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the comcast</font>

719
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:31,559
network to see the impact of<font color="#CCCCCC"> vbr one</font>

720
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,129
outcome might be that on the server side

721
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:37,529
that we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP bbr but then still do to</font>

722
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:39,389
cover the down stream buffer blow

723
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:41,249
mitigation while still running some form

724
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:42,959
of eq m on the modem for the upstream

725
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:47,220
and kind of use those two pieces as an

726
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,840
overall solution thank you welcome time

727
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:53,970
but let's go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have one or two</font>

728
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:56,220
questions right continue oh I'm gonna

729
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:59,539
I'm gonna enjoy those Mike<font color="#CCCCCC"> us miss</font>

we're deep deep<font color="#CCCCCC"> Q here so thanks for</font>

734
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:15,840
capella five nines I'm curious for the

735
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,428
speaker what interactions have you may

736
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,009
be seen in your experience or have you

737
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:22,440
specifically looked at interactions of

738
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:24,570
color loss rates that are not queuing

739
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,419

on cue control specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis up</font>

741
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,840

742
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:34,289
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar 3.1 but I don't suspect</font>

743
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,320
you've added a sequencing or hybrid a RQ

744
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:38,360
layer magically in there so we can

745
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,770
transmit from the motor

746
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,870
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's going to get to</font>

747
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,420
the CMT s and it doesn't go back up the

748
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,340
wire out the other end just fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

749
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,530
something impulse noise or ingress or

750
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,750
otherwise knocked it out right but we're

751
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:53,090
counting against those entries<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if</font>

752
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,680
they got successfully transmitted so we

753
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,090
have a cue that does have a note loss

754
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,830
rate if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> over subscribe it as the</font>

756

things seek to minimize that effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

757
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,980
then we have this other loss process

758
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:05,929
that is not the stochastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> randomized</font>

759
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,490
process it can be very much na

00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">stochastic as we know in the physical</font>

762
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,930
there's anything considering that call

of the boxes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately that's</font>

769

still the case are really not aware of

wall straight back on the CMT s or that

772

measurement point so that's an excellent

point taken that something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can bring</font>

invite you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that because we have</font>

look I take all our operators would

783
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,450
thank you sure thank you let's shake up

784
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:01,669
afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get your contacted oh</font>

hi rob c strim have my badge off to

786
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:07,610
remind<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to say charter communications</font>

787
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:09,350
ah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> noticing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

788
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,899
times that you stated that you did the

789
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:15,020
tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh tended to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm either</font>

790
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:17,030
in bed or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the house did you do</font>

791
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,379
any testing at peak hour where there

792
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,190
might be more contentious for upstream

793
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,120
transmission slots and what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

794
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,700
unfortunately we didn't do any testing

795
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,929
at peak times we kind of that part i'd

796
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,600
say we could probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a better</font>

797
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,700
experiment design on our next go through

798
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,350
but unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we didn't we know</font>

799
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,850
that peak times obviously you know right

800
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">after work when people get home that</font>

801
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,300
window<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it changes over the</font>

802
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,429
weekend unfortunately for this

803
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,620
experiment we really didn't get a view

804
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:44,600
into that when we go out in two

805
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:47,979
experiments with<font color="#CCCCCC"> pi aqm i want to do a</font>

806
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">better comparison on peaked on</font>

807
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,669
because we have the data on when the

808
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,840
peak Thompson you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys know too but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

809
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:55,679
has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another experiment</font>

810
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,659
unfortunately didn't get that thank you

811
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,059
guys thank the speaker Carl again<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

812
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,600
great talk on experiments in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their real</font>

813
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,600
knife network

814
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,918
alright next speaker up is Ron would

815
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,919
work
