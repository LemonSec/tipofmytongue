00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,529
and prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to joining rad where I was at</font>

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,840
server central an end layer for a very

7
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,029
long time where I learned a whole lot

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how to handle volumetric DDoS</font>

9
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,660
attacks I learned a whole lot from this

10
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,500
Community I've been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> member of the</font>

mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> for eight or nine years now</font>

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,289
it's an honor to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here and to talk</font>

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,120
with all you today so thank you at

14
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,469
server central as I said and an end

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,718
<font color="#E5E5E5">layer we were really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good at being</font>

16
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,489
creative about handling volumetric

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,340
attacks and how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle big attacks</font>

18
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,820
inside of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network but there were</font>

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,260
other needs that we had and why we

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,450
looked at some solutions out there and

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,579
ultimately chose radware to help with

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,329
some of those and specific examples of

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,280
attacks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Here I am almost almost a</font>

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,810
year now at radware so what we're going

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
to talk about today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D dots</font>

marketplace we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a little</font>

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,000
story to kind of set a framework for us

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,890
and I'm we're going to talk about this

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,649
hacking pay we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present both</font>

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,139
sides of that does it pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to</font>

32
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:23,399
attack our networks how are they

33
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:25,649
attacking our networks what are the

34
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,869
tools that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using how are these</font>

35
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,009
available to them there's a whole

36
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,779
marketplace that we're going to talk

37
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,389
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its dark net some of its</font>

38
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:36,810
clear net and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap up</font>

39
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:39,089
within and a review<font color="#E5E5E5"> of maybe a different</font>

40
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">look on the ROI on protecting our</font>

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:47,399

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,670
story in 1886 a gentleman named<font color="#E5E5E5"> Frank</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Doria attended a oh hi oh state fair and</font>

44
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,709
he found a one cylinder force four

45
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:57,149
horsepower motor that he thought you

46
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:01,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what this is probably strong enough</font>

47
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,779
to power my horseless carriage so

48
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,340
Charles<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doria was an accomplished</font>

bicycle mechanic with his brother Frank

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,679
and they went to work and in five years

51
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,989
after five years of work they came up

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their first version of the</font>

55
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,880
then advanced five more years by 1896

56
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,640
they became<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first commercially</font>

produced automobile manufacturer in the

United

59
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:34,390
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a for 1,900 I didn't know that</font>

60
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,860
didn't many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably didn't know</font>

61
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of us think that Henry</font>

62
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,080
Ford is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who who we attribute</font>

63
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the automobile but Henry Ford didn't</font>

64
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,460
even actually get into manufacturing

65
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,410
automobiles until<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1901 and the ford</font>

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">motor company didn't start till 1903 so</font>

67
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,000
we've got a couple years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good you</font>

68
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,850
know maybe 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good experience</font>

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,920
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the market and developing cars and</font>

70
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,680
but Henry<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford is the guy who we think</font>

71
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,089
of right and so we attributed that to a

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,660
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we attribute</font>

73
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,390
that to advancements in manufacturing

74
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,060
and Henry Ford is attributed to really

75
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,290
economizing on the assembly line we have

76
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:16,240
advancements in infrastructure roads

77
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,120
Henry Ford made took their other that

78
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,390
recipe and took the recipe of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,280
price and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right product and combine</font>

80
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">that with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right economic situation</font>

81
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,020
we had the roaring 20s world where one

82
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,930
had ended and and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the right</font>

83
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,200
recipe for Henry Ford to be the guy who

84
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,250
we think of with with automobiles right

85
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,869
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> story is a little bit familiar</font>

86
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:43,120
we kind of see us in a similar type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

87
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,610
situation happening right now with how

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,930
people attack us we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

89
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">of examples today we're going to show</font>

90
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,750
you real examples of how the data that

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,660
is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there screenshots of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

92
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,280
sale everybody in this room knows what's

93
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,290
happened in the last month in terms of

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume of the you know the</font>

95
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,100
volumetric attributes of attacks we are

96
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,320
seeing things change very very fast

97
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:09,040
right and we are at this tipping point

98
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,079
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security or cyber attacks in</font>

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,359
our networks and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

100
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,790
three interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects that make this</font>

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,650
up we have more resources so the people

102
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,570
who are attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> us have access to</font>

103
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:25,539
better tools many many options for tools

104
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,210
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more targets for us as people</font>

105
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,740
who operate networks we have a lot of

106
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,859
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are valuable on our network</font>

107
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,810
maybe it's you know digital assets maybe

108
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,100
its intellectual property maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

109
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,650
customer records we're going to talk

110
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,990
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and we have more</font>

111
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,789
maturity we have

112
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,040
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been dealing with DDoS attacks</font>

113
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,500
for a very long time the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

114
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">been doing DDoS attacks have been had a</font>

115
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,310
lot of years for for getting better<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

116
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:56,610
it so it's it's a pretty similar recipe

117
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:01,860
I think so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that hacking has has</font>

118
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:05,310
turned the<font color="#CCCCCC"> corner right so take a kind</font>

119
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a step back here Hollywood</font>

120
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,170
romanticize is hacking and hacking is

121
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,460
there is an interesting attribute to it

122
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,560
to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's somewhat of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

123
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,359
romantic attribute to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to</font>

124
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,800
watch these are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of movies that</font>

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,070
happen to watch sneakers again this

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,530
weekend and I've gone through some you

127
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,300
know some some interesting things there

128
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,820
swordfish is the movie where the

129
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,340
reference a ds3 connected to a computer

130
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,770
that allowed seven network set wants to

131
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,690
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> accessed and that was just amazing we</font>

132
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,549
joke about the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being wrong</font>

133
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,790
in this stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to us this is kind</font>

134
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of funny and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in jest but it's also</font>

135
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,450
Hollywood sets a picture of hackers for

136
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,520
us this<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are legion if you</font>

137
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,099
haven't seen it it's on netflix and

138
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,479
youtube and yeah it's a good one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

139
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,690
see because it's more of a realistic

140
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,180
documentary of of what is what was

141
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,190
happening with anonymous recently but

142
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,920
the reality is that the people attacking

143
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,080
us probably look more like the team on

146
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,130
put out there but the reality is that

the gentleman on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right is probably</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the cold air blasting on to him there</font>

151
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,600
but the point of this is that there is

152
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:23,570
organization in the network and the

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,570
people that are attacking us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,109
let's talk about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> set this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,979
right we have employees we have paid

do recon in a network we have bonuses

163
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:54,840
for good work we have obviously a big

164
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,740
take on bounty or things that were taken

165
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,508
out of a network here we see different

166
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,310
these this graphic shows different

167
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,659
functions that a person might play in an

168
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,270
organization that is that is

169
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:08,190
perpetuating crime and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

170
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,219
because increasingly the answer is that

171
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,310
crime is paying right let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take another</font>

172
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:16,500
look at this dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Larry Ponemon in his</font>

173
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:22,400
group the Ponemon Institute has done

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:25,259
some of the best work on quantifying the

175
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,859
impact of attacks on two networks this

176
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,569
is very hard thing to do and and they've

177
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,340
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great job with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it this is a</font>

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,039
report that ponymon<font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute has done</font>

179
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,568
with palo alto networks and there were a

180
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,150
couple good bullet points that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font>

181
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pull out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of here most interesting to</font>

182
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,580
me the their study says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the average</font>

183
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,919
hacker or attacker earns approximately

184
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,430
one-quarter of the salary of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average</font>

185
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:54,870
IT employee so that swings the pendulum

186
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,810
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way right part of that what</font>

187
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,089
they found is that the cost and time to

188
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,430
to complete attacks has decreased

189
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:05,550
because of better access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to better tools</font>

190
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,949
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> better things out there but</font>

191
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,839
the one point that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would make is that</font>

192
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,729
in contrast<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that first point nobody</font>

193
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,909
goes into this being average wanting to

194
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:16,650
be average nobody plays high school you

195

know plays football wanting to stop in

as users that we have to use diverse

frequently I think we're although it's

still a problem we're more and more

not become a an increasing or decreasing

called zero diem who was offering a 1.5

first a million-dollar bounty for

239

read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was increased to 1.5</font>

hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see this in the back</font>

290
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,510
this is a 30 day view of the value of

291
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,940
Bitcoin there was a twenty percent

292
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,530
decrease in the value of Bitcoin the day

293

don't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that it's simple but</font>

297
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:53,050
from a hack a twenty percent decrease in

298
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,610
the value of a legitimate currency and

299
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,258
now there's a new attribute to that

300
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,720
there's a 3.5 million dollar

reward for<font color="#CCCCCC"> information leading to the</font>

recovery of these bitcoins so you know

303
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:09,429
you could pay to steal that and it could

304
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:12,608
pay to return it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this graph</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may look</font>

right here's the another similarity

could go and buy an attack for very

serious here comes an attack and forward

this to any decision maker in your

<font color="#E5E5E5">good amount of money for a long time we</font>

showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one in seven people have say</font>

they have been ransomed in the past year

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,480
really big distribution a difference in

362
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,030
in what we've seen but in the US 75

363
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,910
hundred dollars was the average ransom

364

paid in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United Kingdom 22,000 pounds</font>

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:50,230
was the was the average ransom that was

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:53,610
paid that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money though</font>

367
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:57,370
on the success of these bought of these

368
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,250
ransom attacks we have copycats right so

369
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,250
this was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty clever those</font>

370
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,320
ransom emails were sent some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it had</font>

371
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:09,690
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of went quiet for a while and then</font>

372
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,160
it earlier this year we saw copycats

373
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,930
people sending very similar type of

374
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">messages sometimes from domains that</font>

375
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,359
were registered that same day and most

376
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,280
of these did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not include the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> letter</font>

377
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,420
more or<font color="#CCCCCC"> less most of them did not</font>

378
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">include the volumetric attack that is</font>

379
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,750
the what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> call a warning shot but</font>

380
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,270
think back to those stressors those

381
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,120
booters and stressors for six dollars or

382
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,220
whatever you can send that warning shot

383
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,610
for very little investment here so think

384
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,010
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the economics of this</font>

385
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,660
now right I've got maybe a VPS somewhere

386
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:46,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get for a couple dollars for a</font>

387
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,209
month I send an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and register a</font>

388
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,860
domain name and I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font>

389
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,870
administrative work and maybe if I want

390
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,420
to I add another six-dollar attack but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

391
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,800
send these fake emails going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

392
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,020
coattails of what had happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

393
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,640
community and these guys reportedly made

a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in about six</font>

395
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:11,290
weeks of of work for just sending email

396
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:14,589
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy a different aspect of the</font>

397
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:16,839
economics of attacks so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recent</font>

398
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,419
one there are new updates to this just

399
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">as recently as this weekend but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

400
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the NSA hack that we know about the</font>

401
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,209
shadow brokers an actor

402
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:28,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">said we have breached the equation group</font>

403
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:32,720
the equation group being associated as

404
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:35,240
the elite hacking team for the NSA the

405
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,670
same team that did the Stuxnet attack on

406
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,090
Iran to dismantle or you know attack

407
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:44,000
their nuclear program so there was a

408
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,350
breach of their attack tools and the

409
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,660
shadow brokers released it to the public

410
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,699
and they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up for auction and they</font>

411
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:53,059
said the highest bidder will win the

412
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,340
tools but anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else who bids is lose</font>

413
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,629
lose they lose the bid they don't win

414
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,970
the auction and they lose their money

415
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,980
you don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your money back and then</font>

416
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">they said if a hundred RF 1 million</font>

417
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,600
Bitcoin were raised which is seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> 572</font>

418
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,700
million dollars they would release all

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,699
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the public that's a</font>

420
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,790
that's a that's a big that's a big hack

421
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,740
that's a big take and takes a little

422
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:19,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">huts but I kind of go out and do that</font>

423
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,570
one to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> update to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this since the</font>

424
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,879
slides were submitted was over the

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,340
weekend they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> canceled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the auction</font>

426
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,290
and now they are crowdfunding is so to

427
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,199
the tune of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 bitcoins which is</font>

428
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,790
about six<font color="#E5E5E5"> million dollars so hopefully</font>

429
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,280
there they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are hoping that they're going</font>

about how people attack us and how

what's there how they get access to it

464

and what we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do about it so this is</font>

mostly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the darknet some of it is on</font>

00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:23,990
the clarinet most places are available

472
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:27,529
for everybody but some places require

473
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:32,029
that you commit a crime to gain access

474
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:33,980
to them and some of them quite

475
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,720
interestingly show you you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

476

they'll give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> target that you have</font>

477
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,620
to hack and if you are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

478
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:43,580
then you gain access to their

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:46,070
marketplace if not sorry the most common

480
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,370
current the you know bitcoin is the

481
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,350
other attribute to this you know I think

482
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin has really driven the</font>

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,389
success of these marketplaces as well

484
00:20:53,029 --> 00:21:01,399
bitcoin is largely anonymous largely lon

485
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:02,840
durable largely easy to to to make this

486
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:04,729
all happen right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not completely</font>

487

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:11,840
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fluidity has made this</font>

489
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:14,000
stuff more successful I think so they

490
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,129
have a fully a full marketplace<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:48,080
targeting our network but here in this

574
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,480
example they've got eight different

575
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,580
price points<font color="#E5E5E5"> for different services that</font>

576
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can buy and these guys were were</font>

577
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,250
recently and again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tent ten days</font>

578
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:04,070
or so ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame these guys were</font>

579
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:09,320
arrested now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting point here</font>

580
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:10,939
is that these guys 19 year old men the

581
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,460
men who were taken into custody for this

582
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:16,760
19 year old men and had been operating

583
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,220
one of the best most well-known stress

584
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,809
for services at out there so don't make

585
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,120
the mistake that somebody who might be

586
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,520
that age has any correlation into

587
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,389
sophistication with this stuff and I

588
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,720
think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a mistake to do that</font>

589
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:35,600
but so they were recently taken offline

590
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">vidas maybe about two weeks ago had some</font>

591
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,549
maybe two to three<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago had some</font>

592
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:44,150
attention these are 18 year old men from

593
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:46,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Israel who were operating this site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 13</font>

594
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:49,160
different attack vectors we

595
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,860
are available for 1999 you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you can</font>

596
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">launch a big attack it was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

597
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,780
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular tools they had customer</font>

598
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,760
service they had like if somebody needed

599
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,149
a question it would send messages text

600
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,760
messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their cell phones and it was</font>

601
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:07,430
really run like a real business right 18

602
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,250
year old men this site was running for

603
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,990
four years so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the media says that the</font>

604
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,780
first two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years they cleared six hundred</font>

605
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:16,610
thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so we can deduce</font>

606
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,889
that in the four years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation</font>

607
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,409
these 18 year old men<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably cleared a</font>

608
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:26,120
million dollars attacking us and beating

609
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:29,210
up our networks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get anything</font>

610
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,699
right here's somebody advertising email

611

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,140
potentially change your grade right I

618
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,360
think that we're going to see people

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:51,199
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example from the real deal bot net</font>

640
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:57,080
rental here's another example somebody

641
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,960
offering the pc machines mobile android

642
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,330
phones like a botnet of 40,000 devices

643
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,760
you know that can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to i said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

644
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,760
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 500 SMS attacks per second</font>

645
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,840
that would be a bad day for somebody who

646
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:14,330
had to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that here's a male of</font>

647
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,060
malware ransom<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad from alpha bay one of</font>

648
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:21,080
the other marketplaces where somebody

649
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:24,139
can can buy a malware to attack your

650
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,689
network right these marketplaces are so

651
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,780
legitimate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they offer escrow</font>

652
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,700
services for payment though I want to

653
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,820
buy something I put money into escrow a

654
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,370
third-party escrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I receive the service</font>

655
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,470
and then the payment is released as to

656
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:44,239
add legitimacy to the service that's how

657
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:46,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">I advanced this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this I thought was</font>

658
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,800
very interesting here's a company called

659
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">serve net networks that there is another</font>

660
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,700
server networks I don't believe it's the

661
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,740
same as on the clear net but this is

662
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,030
dark net hosting right this is for

663
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,390
eighty nine dollars you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

unmetered one gig server up completely

665
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,800
on the dark net right and up to this

666
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:06,440
example there's more there but up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 120</font>

667
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,200
dollars and it's priced just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like every</font>

668
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,460
other legitimate service anyway very

669
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,750
well might be legitimate you know it

670
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,170
does just because you're on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dark net</font>

671
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,630
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that you're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nefarious</font>

672
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,700
things but it's interesting legitimate

673
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,970
business on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark net here's somebody</font>

679
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,418
one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font>

680
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,909
here is somebody advertising a

683
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:58,480
routers out there there are ce8 capable

684
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,600
so i can do remote code exploits an

685
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,039
execution on them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in the notes here</font>

686
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,830
they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you certainly can't see</font>

687
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,908
there are 250,000 of these available in

690
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:24,428
these machines so the economics of you

691
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,350
know what can we do moving forward all

692
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:28,119
of this and all of us us having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

693
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,488
defend this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network has really</font>

694
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:33,249
created a point of we have a lot of

695
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:35,769
spending right and and things change and

696
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:37,929
so we technologies change and and we

697
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:40,149
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent a lot of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to helping</font>

698
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:43,269
protect our networks right we have the

699
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:44,949
traditional stuff the firewalls web

700
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,440
application firewalls we buy more

701
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,659
servers and load balancers and ddos

702
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,590
protection and then on the cloud side of

703
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:56,259
things we buy cloud yeah instances for

704
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:59,949
replication or disaster recovery and we

705
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:01,480
buy dedicated links to our cloud and you

706
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,730
know we have business implications we

707
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> SL a's for customers that we have</font>

708
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,359
to meet if our service<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

709
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,809
we have profits we have cyber insurance

710
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:13,449
that we buy for the people side we train

711
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:15,158
people we hire people we hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

712
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,070
do audits of our networks and pen

713
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,739
testing right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very expensive here</font>

714
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,889
so a lot of people we grunt when it's

715
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:28,600
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I gotta spend more money on</font>

716
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:31,330
my or my security so the ROI for

717
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,879
security is really the holy grail for

718
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,350
for IT right if you can find the right

719
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:36,730
thing that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right price point and</font>

720
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,498
does everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need if that</font>

721
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,549
exists that's our<font color="#E5E5E5"> holy grail right</font>

722
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:45,190
things have stood in our way of that

723
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:47,230
right so the definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of return varies</font>

724
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,779
greatly by our role<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another slide</font>

725
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:53,559
that will talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how certain people</font>

726
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:55,960
define the return differently right poor

727
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:57,830
visibility into our into an<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

728
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,929
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> until it's too late</font>

729
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:02,809
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times we get attacked and then</font>

730
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:05,090
we we're reactive than we say oh I need

731
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:07,340
to I need to prepare for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

732
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,799
it happens you know if it happens again

733
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,209
I'm prepared I need the right tools I

734
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,950
need the right tools to dissect the

735
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,279
information that happened I need the

736
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,899
right tools to protect my network a lack

737
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:21,350
of understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether or not you</font>

738
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:22,580
fit in attackers profile if not knowing

739
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,760
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

740
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking we're worth attacking you for is</font>

741
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,580
is one reason people don't understand

742
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:35,720
this overlooking the actual cost of

743
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:37,158
manual manual mitigation we'll talk

744
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that I personally have done a</font>

745
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,720
whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that and then the hidden</font>

746
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs of processing this attack traffic</font>

747
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example of this</font>

748
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:51,019
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business managers is going to</font>

749
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:53,240
define the return very differently than

750
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:55,880
a risk manager will or a compliance

751
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,590
manager or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I who are actually</font>

752
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,710
driving the network and having to handle

753
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:05,090
what has happened right so we have

754
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">things right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now that we think you know</font>

755
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,918
it's maybe an even scale right I've got

756
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:12,320
compliance I've got revenue and brand

757
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,809
assurance and I've got job security but

758
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,210
I the investment I get security budget

759
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:21,529
is staff and management and operational

760
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:27,169
risk but if I can look at other things I

761
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:28,429
can maybe help help look at the cost of

762
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:32,059
this differently right and that's kind

763
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:36,110
of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about as somebody</font>

764
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:38,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">who handled attacks we had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very big</font>

765
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,699
network we had at server<font color="#E5E5E5"> central and end</font>

766
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,500
layer we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good at handling</font>

767
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,980
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> volumetric attacks we had great</font>

768
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,269
mx-9 60s that we could quickly do

769
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,940
firewall filters and fingerprints and

770
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:51,769
log traffic and very quickly identify

771
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,320
and then block an attack sometimes it

772
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:56,240
was flows back there to block traffic

773
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,418
transiting you know from from peering

774
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,220
ports in San Jose<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something but we</font>

775
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:03,710
were good at it but that's the

776
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,740
volumetric<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of things and it's so</font>

777
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,629
its network layer stuff and it's

778
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,849
reactive right I've got a fingerprint my

779
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,279
attack maybe I have some tools with net

780
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:13,200
flow

781
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,630
but I've got a fingerprint my attack and

782
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:20,158
then make their deploy the solution that

783
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">can take some time especially if it's</font>

784
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,390
the middle of the night you're on call

785
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,429
right so we look to automation sometimes

786
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,989
to say well what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do to make this</font>

787
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,610
easier right maybe it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

788
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:31,379
fingerprinting of the attack that that

789
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:34,080
is a little bit easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's the</font>

790
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:37,950
whole bit right so as engineers we

791
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,480
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking of automation how</font>

792
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,939
much do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we spend about over-provisioning</font>

793
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,980
for bad traffic at our networks at

794
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,840
server central<font color="#CCCCCC"> and end layer we spent a</font>

795
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,659
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money intentionally to be able to</font>

796
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,820
carry traffic right and that was our

797
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:54,210
business model and and we were good at

798
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,370
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not everybody has that you know</font>

799
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,650
that came with a lot of optic costs and

800
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:02,400
dark fiber costs and cross connect to mr

801
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,930
c's and a lot of router real estate you

802
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,900
know the it was not it was not

803
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,580
inexpensive to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that not</font>

804
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,980
everybody can do that and then everybody

805
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,500
has that ability within their business

806
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,870
right and that's not their job to be

807
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:20,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to over provision for us a huge</font>

808
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:24,210
attack right so one example of a

809
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:26,400
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have gave they took</font>

810
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,750
attack traffic a bogus garbage traffic

811
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was coming into their network and</font>

812
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:33,660
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce 100 terabytes</font>

813
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:35,010
of traffic traversing their network when

814
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,259
is an operational cost of a million

815
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,900
dollars a year oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

816
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we are the only ones you</font>

817
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,460
know that this is not a product pitch

818
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:47,880
it'sit's to make you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about if you</font>

819
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,350
can maybe reallocate certain money or

820
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,390
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it differently maybe you</font>

821
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,190
don't have to have have to carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

822
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:58,109
traffic in your network right just as

823
00:35:53,190 --> 00:36:01,530
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider so let's bring it</font>

824
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:05,090
home again with Henry Ford Henry Ford

825
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:07,140
great man took advantage of the right

826
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:10,170
environmental conditions his own

827
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:13,410
ingenuity his own thinking of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

828
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,030
things differently and made a great

829
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:17,700
success<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the automobile industry I</font>

830
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:20,340
do not draw a comparison between Henry

831
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,770
Ford and cyber attack criminals one is a

832
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">great man one or felons and criminals</font>

833
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,940
and

834
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:30,780
that's not what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say but the</font>

835
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,880
similarity is is there right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

836
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,560
security posture has to has to change

837
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,420
right we have more resources available

838
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and they don't all have to be paid</font>

839
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,010
right they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't often there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty</font>

840
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of good tricks and free ways to help</font>

841
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,960
protect yourself there are more targets

842
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,810
we're putting more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

843
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,360
that needs to be protected and the

844
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,730
protections are more mature right so we

845
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,380
have advancements in an AI for

846
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,630
automation for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection and</font>

847
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,930
algorithms and protecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in algorithms</font>

848
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,400
and people who are aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and who</font>

849
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,399
have dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the tax for a long time</font>

850
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:12,680
so it might be tipping in our direction

851
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:15,570
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as Network people so last slide</font>

852
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,600
personally I<font color="#E5E5E5"> love the idea of automation</font>

853
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:21,420
it can help me either identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> an attack</font>

854
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,819
or let me know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it before my</font>

855
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,970
customer calls about it consider

856
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,680
automation<font color="#CCCCCC"> simplify with services maybe</font>

857
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:32,189
you don't have the staff who who wants

858
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,899
to go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do this or you know</font>

859
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:36,090
sometimes these things plug along doing

860
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">their job and then you only have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>
