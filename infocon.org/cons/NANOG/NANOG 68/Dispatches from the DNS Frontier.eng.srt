00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,920

detail it's more gift to give you an

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,970
idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the incredible range of things</font>

that we are doing within<font color="#E5E5E5"> two dns um and</font>

how these folks deep dive<font color="#CCCCCC"> into it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,110

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,629
our website where there are videos and

slides for all of these talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

13

actually get a useful level of detail on

them so first a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about arc it</font>

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:50,729
is essentially an attempt to have a

00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,799
place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who spit go into DNS</font>

where we do a two-day set of talks

21
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:09,759
usually concurrent with nanog or right

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,990
forensics and there are mailing lists

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,570
and other places where the various

42
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,089
engineers can talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things</font>

43
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,128
and share in a somewhat more closed

44
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,099
environment in much the same way that

45
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:13,870
there are other vetted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust groups</font>

46
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,018
for other forms of security and

47
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,629
computers so the conference that we just

<font color="#E5E5E5">had finished yesterday I'm still a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">little toasty to day is full of</font>

50
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:30,119
presentations and we had 130 attendees

51
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,280
and that covered 68 different

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,500
organizations that sent their engineers

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,129
to that talk and we've been averaging

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,220
about 100 220 attendees / for the

55
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:44,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">conferences and now it's I'm going to</font>

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,400
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through some of the talks so</font>

57
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,560
one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very prevalent</font>

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,849
in DNS right now is DNS sex secure dns

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,980
where you have cryptographic signatures

60
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,260
of DNS data so that you can validate

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,319
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS answer you got was what the</font>

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,420
zone owner wanted and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

63
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,700
crypto and and we are now worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

64
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like DNS response sizes as a as a</font>

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,720
DNS amplification vector people are

66
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,760
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all the crypto algorithms</font>

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,959
because like all algorithms there are

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,120
trade-offs you can possibly crunch

69
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,269
something were encrypted faster but it

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">might either be bigger or decrypting it</font>

71
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,239
might be slower you know they're all the

72
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,089
knobs and you have to decide which<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font>

73
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,290
there are there is one called elliptic

74
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,250
curve that's getting a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest</font>

75
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,069
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now because it's fairly cheap to</font>

76
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,560
compute and it has significantly smaller

77
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,358
signatures so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS responses can have</font>

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,549
many bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be cryptographically</font>

79
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:46,650
secure without having to have quite that

80
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:48,120
much of a DNS payload so problem is that

81
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,350
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to do that you</font>

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,989
have to be able to use that algorithm

83
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,200
all the way from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route through the</font>

84
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:58,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">tlds like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calm or net or org to your</font>

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,858
second-level domain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> beyond and if</font>

86
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,069
your algorithm is not supported by

87
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:06,269
whoever is signing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone at that hop</font>

88
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,888
and where it's not supported<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

89
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,500
folks that are running the recursive

90
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,420
servers your crypto doesn't decrypt and

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,239
you either get the choice of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

92
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,719
downgrade attack or not giving an answer

93
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,970
for that DNS so they have been looking

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,349
at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately the</font>

95
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,190
short<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer on this particular one is</font>

96
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:29,219
right now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds and the root servers</font>

97
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,610
are not supporting this algorithm and so

98
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was really sort of a to you know</font>

99
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,880
hey can we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this moving there's an</font>

100
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,000
awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks that really aren't</font>

101
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,860
supporting it yet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that seems</font>

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,699
suboptimal and

103
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,069
so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to proselytize for that</font>

104
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:49,289
another interesting challenge is when

105
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,330
you do DNS SEC you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to put a key</font>

106
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,938
into the parent zone of yours so if i

107
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,310
get register example.com<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to</font>

108
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:59,939
actually put records<font color="#E5E5E5"> into com that you</font>

109
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,830
can use as a hash of my public key so

110
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,550
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at my data in an example</font>

111
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:09,210
com you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through and</font>

112
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:11,550
correctly on validate that does mean

113
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,229
that you need to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> things into the</font>

114
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:17,729
registrar for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> account so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I move</font>

115
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:20,520
from godaddy to dine I have to move

116
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:23,460
stuff in<font color="#CCCCCC"> com by whatever interface they</font>

117
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,620
have and there is no standard API for

118
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:30,599
doing that so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a whole series of</font>

119
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,710
experiences and a recommended RFC for

120
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:37,438
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you either don't have to</font>

121
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,818
take off DNS SEC from your zone or break

122
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:44,550
it while you move it from registrar

123
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:48,089
registrar<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre deployment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of dns and and</font>

124
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,330
testing I love testing there is a tool

125
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:54,319
called DNS biz and the URL for destinos

126
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,750
vis net and it is essentially a

127
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,819
graphical display of all of the steps in

128
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,889
validation and whether they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

129
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,960
or not in nice pretty colors with cute

130
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:08,219
little circles and lines and and graphs

131
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:12,000
just like alice's restaurant it's now

132
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:14,430
being used offline where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

been<font color="#E5E5E5"> released so what you can actually</font>

135
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,250
do is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can point it at your stuff in</font>

your lab before you roll it out into

137
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,150
production so for a change we are not

it's very interesting to debug because

gave you an answer but which version of

166
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,250
one dot to dot 3 dot 4 was it the one in

to see if it really worked well and what

was excellent presentation but someone

also one of the TLD operators and ccTLD

216

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:36,230
so they went through and did more or

less big data crunching and statistical

227

and through some machine learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

some some other lines in this was one

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,890
where I certainly didn't do terribly

well in stats in college but learned a

235
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:05,209
more DNS SEC so DNS SEC works by having

236
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,310
what's called a key signing key which

237
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:10,250
its purpose in life is indeed to sign

238
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,900
keys so what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signs the</font>

and it's a whole chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those so the</font>

242
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:23,040
key signing key gets hashed in

the zone signing key works then you can

250

there's no parent zone for because it's

how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get it to other people</font>

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we test the root servers and so at</font>

288
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,760
this point there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a huge number of</font>

289
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,620
nameservers doing all of this a bit of

<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS esoterica glue records are things</font>

291
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,990
that is in the parent because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,990
referred to<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the child so if i do NS 1</font>

293
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,029
example.com is my name server and you go

294
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm and say what's the IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

295
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:46,899
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> com you have no way to get</font>

296
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,420
there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> glue records allow you to</font>

297
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:52,450
duplicate and put ms one example<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm</font>

298
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,680
into the comm domain as an a record so

299
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,180
you actually get an IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

300
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,010
can then go and ask what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name</font>

301
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:02,770

304
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,979
interesting analysis of what kind of

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,130
legitimate stuff was in there and what

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:20,189
kinds of things were being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used commonly</font>

and less commonly hunger for<font color="#CCCCCC"> qua days</font>

an awful lot of V for transport answers

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little early the problem was that</font>

00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,418
there are whole series of these boxes

365
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,279
that apparently even if you don't sign

366
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:18,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">up for the cloud service they will still</font>

do a health check<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever and you cannot</font>

368
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:23,000
disable this and they apparently did a

369
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,859
really bad job at engineering their name

370
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,829

371
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:29,830
all of them off the internet what that

372
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:32,090
means is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the recursive servers</font>

suddenly get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> surf fail it's the</font>

00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:39,559
an answer that's all I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell you it</font>

376
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,710
became enough of a load that it

377
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:45,490
basically became almost half of their

378
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:48,080

382
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,270
so they don't cash the fact that oh I'm

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait some period of time before</font>

are not a lot

resolvers that are overly helpful and it

387
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:11,750
puts a huge strain on the infrastructure

388
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,150
Yeti is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> project that is interesting</font>

389
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,040
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking the root servers is a</font>

390
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,570
bad thing but there's a lot of stuff

391
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd really like to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to know</font>

392
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,470
about the root servers it's hard to do

393
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,820
in the labs because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be</font>

394
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,490
widely distributed you need to have a

395
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,429
very wide<font color="#E5E5E5"> client base so essentially</font>

396
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it came down to is how do we have</font>

397
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,190
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks and smells and acts</font>

398
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,140
more or less like the root server

399
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,320
infrastructure without having to break

400
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,200
the infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and the Yeti</font>

401
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,370
project was spun up to do that and so

402
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,190
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have is they have the</font>

403
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,689
root zone but they change the IP

404
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,840
addresses of the service to their own

405
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:50,570
servers and then leave everything else

406
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,070
within the zone data alone and then they

407
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,389
run experiments and in this case what

408
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,850
they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> was they were doing what</font>

409
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,980
happens if the zone signing key for the

410
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,139
root zone if we have multiples of them

411
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,000
does it break anything what happens if

412
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,360
we put out a big zone signing key

413
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,240
because recently we we up the size of

414
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,790
the keys how many bits we use to encrypt

415
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">with our key sonic Ian's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own signing key</font>

416
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:16,070
and what happens with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the KS k and a</font>

417
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:21,550
rollover and this was this experiment

418
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:27,439
and the results and lessons learned any

419
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:29,180
cast and ddos<font color="#E5E5E5"> any cast is a very good</font>

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">defense in a lot of ways like I said it</font>

421
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,640
increases<font color="#CCCCCC"> your attack surface if they</font>

422
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:38,650
have to have bots in multiple a esas to

attack you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in multiple a esas</font>

424
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,490
at this point all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root servers</font>

425
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,060

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,910
that's actually every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

429
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:58,310
those which gets down to an IP address

430
00:19:52,910 --> 00:20:01,420
before and b6 is a few to dozens of any

431
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:04,250
cast cluster scattered around the world

432
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:07,930
however there was an attack on it last

433
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:10,340
year that hit one of the root servers

434
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,410
this is normally not a problem because

435
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,300
that's why we have 13 letters so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

436
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,670
you know if you can't reach one you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

437
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to another</font>

438
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:22,120
and we have fairly long<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttls a couple of</font>

439
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">days as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I recall once you get an answer</font>

440
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,610
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ask again but when you start</font>

441
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,050
having that when you are any casted and

442
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,899
you're noticing that you're under attack

443
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,629
what do you do you know do you try and

444
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,200
shift traffic how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you decide where to</font>

445
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,540
ship traffic do you leave it alone do

446
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliberately decide that this small</font>

447
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,399
hub with a small number of customers get

448
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,060
sacrificed so that you don't completely

449
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,600
lose all capability and so this paper

450
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:56,440
was a breakdown<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the choices the</font>

451
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,060
issues and what you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to</font>

452
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,340
intelligently make that kind of decision

453
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,340
for your infrastructure in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast</font>

454
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:12,399
so this was another in the how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we</font>

455
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:17,260
get on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route trust anchor the key</font>

456
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,020
signing key key key securely and this

457
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,840
was someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who decided to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write it in</font>

458
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python and do all of the various steps</font>

459
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they broke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down you know how do you</font>

460
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,899
know where to get it securely how do you

461
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,670
know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is the correct key how do</font>

462
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,830
you ram it into your automation and and

463
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:38,010
go through and they have code as a

464
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:41,560
sample all right and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

465

esoterica alert ENT is not ear nose and

466
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:48,600
throat it is something called an empty

467
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:53,050
non-terminal so if i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dot B</font>

468
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">example.com</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i am doing dns correctly</font>

469
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:59,639
and following all the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

470
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:03,660
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zone b dot example.com and</font>

471
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:08,580
within that is some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns label a</font>

472
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:12,340
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> RR set that record to that</font>

473
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:15,070
however we have been allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be lazy</font>

474
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and sloppy for decades now and and</font>

475
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,389
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the authoritative</font>

00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:23,949
name server software allows me to put a

477
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:26,470
dot B into the example.com zone you

478
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,230
don't know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not aww example</font>

479
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm is a correct set of threes</font>

480
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:36,280
and one single<font color="#E5E5E5"> label or if it is what's</font>

481
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:41,830
called an empty non-terminal because b

482

483
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:48,689
terminal because their stuff that should

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:52,840
have been in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone be the label a</font>

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:56,440
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an empty non-terminal DNS SEC is</font>

486
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,059
an interesting exercise because many of

487
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,169
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we got away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with in</font>

488
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:05,710
breaking the rules for decades are wrong

489
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,120
and are insecure because one of the

490
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,120
things that should happen is there

491
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,699
should be that zone be example.com which

492
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,659
should include key signing keys and zone

493
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:20,410
signing keys and should have a hash of

494
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:22,150
that in the example com file so if I'm

495
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,370
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate that a dot B dot</font>

496
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,559
example.com works and is

497
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,689
cryptographically correct I have to

498
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,418
actually do all of that work because

499
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:35,080
there is no be example calm and none of

500
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:37,840
the labels with that all sorts of other

501
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> including proof of non-existence</font>

502
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,850
and saccharine sec 3 records all break

503
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,040
there is also as we're going through and

504
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,689
now trying to clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up code all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of</font>

505
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,700
other side effects of various things

506
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:53,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that go through and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

507
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:55,990
breakdown<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what a French agency found</font>

508
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,449
out including some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

509
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,070
Google had actually done what they were

510
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,840
supposed to involve the rules and

511
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:05,770
because the way they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

512
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:09,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">just broke and Google validates so that</font>

513
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:12,340
label was unusable and they came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

514
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,130
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting hack which is putting in</font>

515
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,199
it a txt record in the right place to

516
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,470
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mask the fact that there's an</font>

517
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,299
empty non-terminal and that allowed the

518
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,000
signatures of non-existence or the you

519
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:30,309
know the N SEC records to do more the

520
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,179
right thing there was a very interesting

521
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:36,129
presentation on what happens when you

522
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:37,120
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to decide for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

523
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,000
whether you want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain</font>

524
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,320
provider as the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person to own the</font>

525
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,720
zone files for you and do your

526
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,899
authoritative<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

527
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,950
or you are running authoritative DNS and

528
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,960
someone wants a disinterested third

529
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,930
party or third parties to actually watch

530
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,420
and so what this was was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown of</font>

531
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,550
a whole series of how do you measure

532
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,710
what do you measure what are the

533
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:02,020
trade-offs who do you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at who do you</font>

534
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,750
compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how can you come up with</font>

535
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:08,590
essentially being an informed consumer

536
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,120
or be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say to your customers you</font>

537
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,850
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen something weird but here's</font>

538
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,370
what not only me but everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else who</font>

539
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:20,649
measures and watches me saw so it's

540
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:24,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably something else so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is in a</font>

541
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:26,650
nutshell what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered as I said that</font>

542
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,860
that is now two days worth of detailed

543
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,570
talk so please go to this website it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

544
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,540
a link to the conference which has

545
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,879
videos it has slides the other is that

546
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,399
has information on future conferences

547
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,140
and on membership if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide that DNS</font>

548
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,820

555
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,080
will dig into the site to see all the

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,020
detailed data but one thing that seemed

557

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be relevant to this crowd out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

briefly say whether or not the

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,900
discussion of status notifications or

561
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,409
otherwise getting information out to the

562
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,030
affected population was covered we

563
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,040
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about notification</font>

564

and that is definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult because</font>

565
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,050
one of the problems is that if you any

<font color="#E5E5E5">cast you are peering with people with</font>

which in many cases you have no existing
