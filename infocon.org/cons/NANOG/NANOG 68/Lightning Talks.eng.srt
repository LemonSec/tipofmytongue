1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:14,559
right hey guys good morning so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

2
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:16,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hoping that this lightning talk</font>

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">hook kit approve I was hoping it will</font>

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,410
get approved for Tuesday session but it

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:25,270
can't proof of a mistake but anyway it's

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:28,090
good and talk to you folks environment

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,180
most of us are used to like pressure out

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,010
paying for troubleshooting purposes we

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,710
know how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use those tools but there's</font>

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,570
a lot of other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should we</font>

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,110
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember and now while we are</font>

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,710
troubleshooting so we'll see how mpls<font color="#E5E5E5"> om</font>

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,210
worked so the packet format the three or

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,720
four components that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look for</font>

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:53,640
is the version number message type and I

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,379
focus more likely on the reply code in

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,030
this we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the message type as the</font>

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">mpls equal request or they could reply</font>

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:05,349
and on the reply mode you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> options</font>

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,439
like do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not apply with a reply with UDP</font>

21
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:10,960
packet or UDP with router alert we're in

22
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,399
the process is not our the back it is

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,009
not hardware switch and said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,560
processed by the software and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

25
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,540
have the reply with the application

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,800
level control so if you have an

27
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,200
application that understands<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:28,298
packets it will use those and to respond

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,490
the important things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

30
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:34,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand from the t.o perspective for</font>

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,100
mpls packets is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a TD packet</font>

32
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,940
if you're an IP packet is coming in<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:42,130
the TTL value of x the path the TD value

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,200
will be copied<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next or the MPLS</font>

35
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:48,130
packet itself with one value less than

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 X that is X minus 1 if the TD value</font>

37
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:54,100
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 then it does not forward the packet</font>

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,869
it neither strips off the label or

39
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,520
neither forwards at an IP packet so

40
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,130
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you</font>

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,780
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember while you're using mpls</font>

42
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:07,298
trace or mpls<font color="#E5E5E5"> om packets now how do you</font>

43
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,260
use it you can use on this is a example

44
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:14,049
on cisco platforms using ping mpls ipv4

45
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,239
and you're done well you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> verbose</font>

46
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,849
and different other options to see how

47
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,750
the MPLS work this will verify your LSP

48
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,239
is completed

49
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're LSP is complete throughout the</font>

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,060
where your thing if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you will</font>

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,359
see failures and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different return</font>

53
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:36,940
codes at different hops but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this not it</font>

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,830
it will see an example women<font color="#CCCCCC"> with big</font>

55
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,540
you actually check if your fake is

56
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,910
working fine or not but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tracy I'll do</font>

57
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,250
you actually go hop by hop and see how

58
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,480
it's working or if mpls enable or not

59
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,590
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything is blocking or not so</font>

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,590
we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick example of this</font>

61
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:57,730
topology where we have to 2p routers p1

62
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:01,870
and p2 IP 11 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 1 dot one dot one</font>

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:04,000
dot two and you have seen routers you

64
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,670
have VPN labels on both the PE routers

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,890
and the core having the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP labels for</font>

66
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,010
both the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P notes for the forwarding</font>

67
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,579
perspective what happens when you trace

68
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">route in the MPLS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network first the IP</font>

69
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,770
packet comes in with TTL value<font color="#E5E5E5"> one first</font>

70
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,080
time it'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropped then the next</font>

71
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's detail value of to that TQ</font>

72
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,230
value is copied to the MPLS label and

73
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,030
with one subtracted that is legal value

74
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of one but now when the packet moves</font>

75
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,920
forward off to the P router it will be

76
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,958
TTL value<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

77
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,380
forward so what happens is the Teague a

78
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,150
value for the next label goes to 255 but

79
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,579
at this time it's a Stiga<font color="#CCCCCC"> Valley</font>

80
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,400
exceeded because the TD value was one

81
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,260
and now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to 255 back is then</font>

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,730
forwarded now remember usually what

83
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,500
happens when you have a TD value

84
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,630
exceeded it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the source but</font>

85
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,880
the ping was initiated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sea router</font>

86
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,579
so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sending it back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

87
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,190
source it will be forwarded across so

88
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,410
that it can be folded back from the

89
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,540
remote see router the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> being you</font>

90
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,780
do not know or you do not have control

91
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,200
or access to the prefixes in the service

92
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,649
provider core network so outgoing lab

93
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,519
label you have aggregate and IP lookup

94
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:25,630
is done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vrf on the turn side the</font>

95
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,430
tto guys decremented to 50 52 to 54 the

96
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,020
same as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next top but remember the</font>

97
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,910
packet at the underlying packet was

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,140
initially UDP packet and

99
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:37,420
it's just icmp<font color="#CCCCCC"> TDL exceeded and there's</font>

100
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,210
return goes back to the originating

101
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:44,770
router or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> C router where the ping or</font>

109
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,010
all the traceroute initiated and the

110
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,290
message is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being forwarded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the sea</font>

router<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the TTL value exceeds now</font>

112
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,680
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens is when you trace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the route</font>

113
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,150
you do not want from your service

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,210
provider perspective you do not want

115
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,280
those nodes in the middle of your

116
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,780
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be shown to the external CD</font>

117
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,789
routers so what do you do you can

118
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually hide them using one single</font>

119
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,370
command that is do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not propagate the TTL</font>

120
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,380
to the sea doubters and you can

121
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,020
configure this on the P side what

122
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,900
happens is if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the normal</font>

123
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">trace route you will see that the packet</font>

124
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,440
travel to trace off traverses through

125
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,530
the local<font color="#CCCCCC"> PD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the core router and</font>

126
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,990
their mode p and then the remote see but

127
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,849
if you configure this command you will

128
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,180
see that the core router is missing from

129
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,560
the trash out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what you want</font>

130
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this is an example where you</font>

131
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,410
have just one code node but you might

132
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,979
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> or tens and multiple nodes which</font>

133
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:05,800
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide from the external users</font>

134
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:08,710
how this work so in this when you send a

135
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,810
packet you have the same VPN label and I

136
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep it label but this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time instead of</font>

137
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,490
copying the TTL value from the IP packet

138
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:20,740
and reducing it by one it just says<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

139
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">TV value to 255 now the next packet when</font>

140
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,880
it moves further forward and strips off

141
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP label because of the PHP it</font>

142
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,060
copies<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TTL value one subtracted 2 54</font>

143
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now look at this the funny thing is</font>

144
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,830

the state of the DNS libraries they said

288
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,100
does the nez libraries are made by for

<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS people and not for application</font>

290
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:43,720
developers so they decided we create our

291
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,640
own specification and that became the

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,070

359

unserer which is not in a sec<font color="#CCCCCC"> pellet</font>

360
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:54,689
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not authentic so get eNOS can</font>

361
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,270
work around that by doing its own

362
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:00,670
synthesis so get eNOS also has many

363
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:04,780
features and is actually developed

364
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:10,930
alongside the development of privacy for

368
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:26,379
been many improvements to do dienes

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:30,419
alpha state for transport for example a

to put time out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they also draft</font>

373
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:46,870
about ways to authenticate the TLS

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:50,080
session and also eating a share of

375
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,780
padding so she'll get eNOS has lots and

376
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,550
lots and lots of more features which are

377
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,879
not going to talk about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

378
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,280
features are actually interesting for

379
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,520
for any application right it would be

380
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:08,139
nice if any application on your system

381
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:13,900
could use get eNOS as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a resolve a stub</font>

382
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:16,690
resolver with these features so while

383
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,210
developing getting as we we use it have

384
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,820
this tool getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> as query which can use</font>

385
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:26,710
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the features that are available in</font>

386
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:34,270
get eNOS is also used in creating unit

387
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:36,430
tests and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the one dot one or</font>

388
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:39,280
the first offer relief for<font color="#E5E5E5"> bundled one</font>

389
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:42,720
getting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan the request handling so</font>

390
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:47,980
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually act as a little server</font>

391
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,870
so this was the state of get eNOS<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

392
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,610
have all these nice features that are

393
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,219
very nice to have for for any

394
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:58,090
application there was this getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font>

395
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,400
Larry tool that can use them all getting

396
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:04,379
square you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also do request handling</font>

397
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,990
which is new in getting as one was 101

398
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:11,590
so getting in square it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> our act as</font>

399
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,530
a lab local step resolver to provide

400
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:18,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">others things for for any application on</font>

401
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:22,080
our system so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step</font>

402
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:24,310
study<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just getting this query but</font>

403
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,260
with a different name it's actually

404
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,780
installed with a different name<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and</font>

405
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:33,520
it behaves a little bit different than

406
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:38,399
the default getting is<font color="#E5E5E5"> caring so this is</font>

can be altered by config files but here

421
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:41,320
are a few example configuration file the

422
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,320
the first one is an example of how to

configure dns alpha TLS opportunistic

424
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,710
that means that the TLS connection is

<font color="#CCCCCC">not actually authenticated but let's</font>

authenticate by certificate

441
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,850
but by the public key used instead of

00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:03,730
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is signed and watch what name it</font>

443
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:05,949
uses so study actually has since it is

<font color="#E5E5E5">getting a square it has all the command</font>

line options getting as query also heads

446
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:19,209
which are many so you could simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:23,250
study with Dina<font color="#CCCCCC"> shake validation enabled</font>

448
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:28,240
as well by providing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus T in a sec</font>

453
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:43,719
the validate that it works by sending it

454

458
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:06,840
still alpha we will have a stable

459
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:11,080
release for getting as one not one

460
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:14,320
before the end of the year though it

461
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,169
will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> also release more stables</font>

462
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,750
to be but whatever i've been using

463
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:22,420
stable now since the dinosaur this

464
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:27,130
weekend without any problems with the

465
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:29,350
opportunistic TLS so with with

466
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,870
authenticators or strict t less than you

467
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,929
might encounter some problems still but

468
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,969
we will work on that and we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

469
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,730
new version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cattiness with a fixed</font>

470
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:42,010
stable so we we came up with the name

471
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,440
stubby because it's sort of catchy and

472
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,900
then John Dickerson one of the

473
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,279
developers of cattiness discovered that

474
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:54,440
there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

questions for our speakers mat pita

481
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:36,570
yahoo for the person doing the peering

482
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:39,090
tool looks awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a little</font>

483
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:42,480
curious so if your router is your

484
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:44,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">back-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you put in an md5 password for</font>

somebody's appearing session it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

486
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router it looks like when you</font>

487
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,350
pulled it back up all you have access to

488
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,658
at that point is the encrypted string

489
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:55,320
you lose access to what the unencrypted

490
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:58,470
md5 string in is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> correct you might</font>

00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,149
be right<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you run into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation</font>

492
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,590
where they say can you apply the same

493
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:03,238
string that we had on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that other router</font>

494
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,769
over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're kind of going I</font>

495
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:07,789
don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that string was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore</font>

496
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:10,289
usually when we augment to pierce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

497

<font color="#E5E5E5">good in google also for the pairing</font>

502
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,129
automation question interesting that you

503
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,950
looked at it appears you configure

504
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:31,980
individual sessions individually not

505
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:35,279
d foot have a standard configuration

506
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:38,580
most networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fear with as Google seem</font>

507
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,380
to have consistency and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally</font>

508
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:45,750
find that where there's exceptions

509
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:47,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're usually errors I'm not sure I</font>

510
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,710
understand what you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean so you</font>

511
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,899
had the prefix limit listed for each

512
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,210
individual session instead of just the

513
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:57,500
prefix limit for the pier yeah well what

514
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,539
we personally do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we set prefix limits on</font>

515
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,880
on the entire prayer group and then for

516
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:05,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">every individual peer who who wants</font>

517
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,510
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> different we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alternate period</font>

518
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:12,899
i'm prepared by pair basis and this is

519
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:14,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool we built it works but we can</font>

520
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:16,799
also add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> features so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font>

521
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:20,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">i want to encourage you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

and that would be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice feature that I</font>

so thank you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of our speakers</font>
