1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright good afternoon all it's really</font>

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">good to stand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk about</font>

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the data we have so just to</font>

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,598
clear the air a little bit unlike a lot

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,110
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this audience or background</font>

6
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,450
we are not actually building large-scale

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,759
high-capacity networks at scale but

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,220
we're pretty good at finding faults in

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,890
them and that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this talk is</font>

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,579
about it's about some interesting events

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,289
that we've seen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past and I wanted</font>

12
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">to share with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the audience here some of</font>

13
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:45,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be affected by these as well</font>

14
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:48,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">so would be good to get some perspective</font>

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:53,539
on what you guys saw during these events

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:56,089
as well so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave this workshop real</font>

17
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,649
quick before I get into the details of

18
00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:00,140
this I wanted to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second just</font>

19
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,719
talking about the data set that we're

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,059
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on here so at a high level this</font>

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,460
is a combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two different kinds</font>

22
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:09,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data so if you look at the first set</font>

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data it's what we call as active</font>

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:16,700
probing so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we use about</font>

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:19,610
you know 120 130 140 sites that are

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,740
geographically dispersed to test

27
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,440
performance at various layers at the

28
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,350
application layer at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network layer</font>

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,050
including the hop by hop that's etc from

30
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,880
from these sites to specific targets so

31
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,190
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would be looking at</font>

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,649
connectivity and performance to to

33
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,630
facebook to twitter to google to all of

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,310
the popular sites and then dish in

35
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this we also have the data</font>

36
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> collect from a bunch of our</font>

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,210
users on the routing side and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

38
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,450
where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets a bit more interesting as</font>

39
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">well to this audience we do ingest data</font>

40
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,130
from the BGP feeds such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> route fuse</font>

41
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,320
and right piece right and what is

42
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting there is again correlating</font>

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,759
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP data with layer 3 information</font>

44
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,590
that we have so at a higher level that's

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,470
the data set that we're talking about

46
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the talk and I'll go</font>

47
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">through details as we come across them</font>

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,430
so one of the things we noticed when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,440
started collecting it and really looking

50
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this data at a larger scale is that</font>

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">outage is happening all the time and if</font>

52
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,859
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> cared about every single out</font>

53
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,960
then we would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> busy all the time we</font>

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,850
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some sleep so what we've</font>

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,060
seen is lots of outages going on all the

56
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,040
time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not every outage is affecting</font>

57
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,930
the vast majority so what I'm going to

58
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,510
focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the talk here</font>

59
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:40,950
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 outages that were fairly</font>

60
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:44,160
significant fairly wide in terms of the

61
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,339
impact and we will dive a little bit

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,440
deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> into what happened there so the</font>

63
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,190
three events that i mentioned they start

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,280
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most recent being the dns root</font>

65
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,870
server attack how many folks were aware

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,200
of this in the room just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show our</font>

67
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,480
fans the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS root server attack so there</font>

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,670
was another one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> December which got a</font>

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,280
lot of publicity and was was much worse

70
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,049
and so I'm guessing there were more

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,150
folks that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of that the</font>

72
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,210
submarine cable fault books that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

73
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,030
aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this or were impacted by this</font>

74
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:21,870
anyone in the room to a few hands and

75
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:25,430
then the AWS route leak how many people

76
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">were impacted by that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or well ok good so</font>

77
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,920
so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three events and</font>

78
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,150
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very very</font>

79
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,829
different events so we'll go into that

80
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">one by one I know I'm standing between</font>

81
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,760
you and a break so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,820
good pace here to keep moving so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">root DDoS attack this happened on jun</font>

84
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:45,299
25th it started at about 2 45 p.m.

85
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,140
pacific about 2145 you TC it lasted for

86
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,990
about two hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and change actually</font>

87
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,820
three hours if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do the math there and</font>

88
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,220
what we saw was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting is</font>

89
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,900
you saw the impact across all all the

90
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,460
root servers so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one root</font>

91
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,890
server or two root servers it was

92
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,780
impacting all the root servers from what

93
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,109
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was a sin and ICMP flood</font>

94
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,380
that came through and the volumes are

95
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,150
pretty high at about 15 to 17 gigs per

96
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,859
second so that's what we know about the

97
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,930
attack now what you see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the graph</font>

98
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,549
here is showing the availability of the

99
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,709
root servers across all the servers and

100
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,209
you can see a dip and it's gradually

101
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,260
starting to come together as people are

102
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to grapple with the attack but</font>

103
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to keep in mind for this</font>

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,330
is just the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> availability</font>

105
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,380
issues we also saw fairly

106
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,359
barely noticeable change on the average

107
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,580
response times now this doesn't seem

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a huge change is 230 milliseconds</font>

109
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,080
average across all the different sites

110
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,849
but this is because a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites</font>

111
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,690
are any casted so they're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> close</font>

112
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to where the probing points are and then</font>

113
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,750
this graph which is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,429
shows you the impact that was on each

115
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,220
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> root server now what you</font>

116
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice here from the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bottom we've</font>

117
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,700
started it based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of errors</font>

118
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,460
we've seen and the errors being the

119
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,950
availability errors in this case so we

120
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,930
we see each root server and be root

121
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,270
server in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular taking a pretty big</font>

122
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,280
hit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> availability and on the bottom</font>

123
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,560
end of the spectrum are the ones like a

124
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,719
J and L that are doing fairly well

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,790
compared to the volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attack and</font>

126
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the disruption we saw across the rest of</font>

127
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,110
the root servers so we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was</font>

128
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,490
really interesting that it's impacting

129
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,350
different route service differently and

130
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,300
there's a whole lot of factors that go

131
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,220
into why this happens with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

132
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,780
one particular pattern that we saw that

133
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,390
that I thought was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

134
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,090
and what sharing so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

135
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:42,719
servers again we'll focus on this but as

136
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,570
a side note just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a similar behavior was</font>

137
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,480
up was also seen by the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mon</font>

138
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,880
data where you can see in this very

139
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,820
readable flight up there with all the

140
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,860
large fonts that the red belongs to the

141
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,650
be root servers and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> G and H</font>

142
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,340
which are the same as the the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

143
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,049
here now this again as I mentioned in

144
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> preload is not as bad as the</font>

145
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">December 2015 d-does just in terms of</font>

146
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,470
the impact right so that's a comparison

147
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,140
point now we'll focus on the 8th route

148
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,030
server and look at one one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

149
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,950
was interesting there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> H is any casted</font>

150
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,080
from two sides and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> both in the</font>

151
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's just one fact to keep in</font>

152
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,039
mind and let's let's move on we'll make

153
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,540
some conclusions<font color="#E5E5E5"> B which was the other</font>

154
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,520
one the list at the top which was

155
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,500
impacted the worst was also any casted

156
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">from or actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's unicast it's not</font>

157
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,990
even in any case I'd hear something to

158
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,670
fix so that was announced only from<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

159
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,400
site right so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bureau server</font>

160
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,480
now we focus on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom end of the</font>

161
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,719
spectrum the ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were least</font>

162
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,660
impacted and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> j root server has had</font>

163
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,240
at that time

164
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,030
113<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anika sites now this picture was</font>

165
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,430
taken recently and as of now they have

166
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,469
116 sites they have added<font color="#CCCCCC"> three more</font>

167
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,180
sites since the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS attack but the</font>

168
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason the title is 113 was at that</font>

169
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">point it had 113</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> annika sites and fairly</font>

170
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,430
well spread out internationally as well

171
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,220
and the l root server has 150 for Anika

172
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,790
sighs so if you notice as a pretty

173
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,800
strong correlation here between the

174
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,600
different impact that you saw at the the

175
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,840
highest level where they were one or two

176
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,400
or none in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> chanukah sites to</font>

177
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,770
the lower end of the spectrum where they

178
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,960
had a lot of sites so we could clearly

179
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,609
see a correlation<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the number of</font>

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">sites and the impact on the attack right</font>

181
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,290
and it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense because any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost is</font>

182
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,430
is basically regionalizing the attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

183
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">a large extent if you have an attack</font>

184
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,420
trap if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TAC traffic coming</font>

185
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,920
from from South America<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you have an</font>

186
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,450
instance that it's taking the traffic

187
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,890
locally if it is done right so that

188
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,510
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we did see some</font>

189
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,539
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> patterns where there were a</font>

190
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,120
few exceptions<font color="#CCCCCC"> where some root servers</font>

191
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,700
had a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of any cache sites but</font>

192
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually did pretty well and when</font>

193
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,560
we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that it seemed like the</font>

194
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,210
capacity was a big factor that they just

195
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of capacity and they could</font>

196
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,120
manage all of that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

197
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,620
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the key point I want to</font>

198
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,760
make here is just any casting doesn't

199
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,010
necessarily mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font>

200
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,110
suddenly be good against d-does you

201
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,270
still have to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> at capacity that's an</font>

202
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,040
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> point the other thing we</font>

203
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,049
noticed was during this attack as the

204
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,880
attack started we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> root operator</font>

205
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,820
starting to make BGP changes so this is

206
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,490
one where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the a root operator and</font>

207
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,169
we see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of changes now i'll just</font>

208
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">quickly go through the graph here so you</font>

209
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:24,250
can make some sense out of that the

210
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,490
green nodes of they're the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones that</font>

211
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,800
start with 36 they are the destination

212
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,400
is that is announcing the block<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

213
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular route and then the white</font>

214
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,000
nodes were the ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were announcing</font>

215
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,860
it before that have now stopped

216
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,570
announcing it so you can see the router

217
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,800
origination is shifting the paths are

218
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,070
shifting they're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move some</font>

219
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,329
traffic around and that's that was

220
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,010
pretty consistent with other route

221
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,570
operators as well we saw a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

222
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,250
shifts similar to this where there were

223
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:55,960
out changes going on as they were trying

224
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:57,130
to handle the attack the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing to</font>

225
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,010
note was the

226
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:03,700
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 on layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 when we looked at</font>

227
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the packet loss matrix looking at</font>

228
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:11,710
it hop-by-hop this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the H</font>

229
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:14,350
which is with the the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Defense and the loss was not only</font>

231
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,620
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the terminal site at the</font>

232
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,270
network which hosted the root server was

233
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,420
also happening upstream from the network

234
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this was just an indication of the</font>

235
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,270
the volume of the traffic in the fact

236
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,920
that the upstream ISPs were also to some

237
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,620
extent struggling to deal with this that

238
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,719
was an interesting observation as well

239
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,130
and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a quick summary of</font>

240
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things we find that are pretty</font>

241
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">common in some of these DDoS attacks we</font>

242
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,540
find a velvety being hit we find the

243
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,740
resolution takes a good standard

244
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,780
deviation different from is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

245
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,940
standard deviation different from what

246
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,410
it was before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case for DNS</font>

247
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,450
in particular you will see multiple root

248
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,900
servers impacted it was not directed a

249
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,820
specific route and then we saw an impact

250
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,709
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upstream as well so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

251
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,650
the quick summary for the drawers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

252
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS servers the next thing we look at is</font>

253
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">the see me for a see me week for cable</font>

254
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,699
fault and this was again a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

255
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,860
different kind of event because it

256
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,170
actually involves then under undersea

257
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,150
cable which is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard thing to fix</font>

258
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,550
in a matter of seconds or minutes right

259
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,910
so as an example one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things we</font>

260
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,579
saw in this particular event was this is

261
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:28,180
a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three trace going from one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

262
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:30,610
four locations in New Delhi and it's the

263
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,680
fourth point that you see where there

264
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,480
are three red links the red<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a</font>

265
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,280
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the red is indicating high</font>

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,230
latency and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is indicating</font>

267
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:43,900
that it's an inter a link between in

268
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,940
this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bombay and Marcel so that's</font>

269
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the link that exists between Bob and</font>

270
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,900
MRSA in that case and that's under

271
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,380
normal situations that's how the trace

272
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,810
would look now what we noticed for the

273
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,790
same trace at that particular instance

274
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,000
of time around May seventeenth around

275
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:04,120
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pacific was that the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

276
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,510
terminating at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tata exit point in</font>

277
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,390
Bombay and so given that it was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

278
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,510
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

279
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,189
the long<font color="#E5E5E5"> haul plank we had some guess</font>

280
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,080
that this is something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do with a</font>

281
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,680
cable and it's not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Tata</font>

282
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,050
issue so we we continue to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

283
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,630
also notice that similar issue was being

284
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:27,219
seen in telecom italia but in a

285
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:29,390
different part of the of the network

286
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,680
geographically but it coincided with the

287
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:35,840
similar time so in case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TI sparkle we</font>

288
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,449
saw the issue being somewhere in Italy

289
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,120
where packet loss had started going from

290
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,070
Romania so two different providers being

291
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,940
impacted by a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar event at the</font>

292
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,560
same time and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice bgp changes</font>

293
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,500
as well so this is one example where

294
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,380
Netflix was directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TI</font>

295
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">sparkle and that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

296
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,000
the picture here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the right hand</font>

297
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">side you see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the TI sparkle Netflix</font>

298
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,640
bgp session is now no longer being

299
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:09,290
advertised but TI sparkle uses level 3 3

300
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:12,290
3 5 6 to reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix and so what we</font>

301
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,689
saw was some quick reactions on some of

302
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,099
these providers such as Netflix to try

303
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,240
to get around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem so it's a good</font>

304
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,370
sign and then we we go down to just

305
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,800
looking at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is common between tart</font>

306
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,400
th Parker went out and found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

307
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">seamy v3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and see me be4 cable segments</font>

308
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,300
were shared by both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so this is</font>

309
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,530
again we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real time so</font>

310
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,479
we don't really know what is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

311
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,640
this is at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time it sir</font>

312
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,160
guess on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is happening and</font>

313
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,449
we narrow down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of these two</font>

314
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
segments that were potentially

315
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:47,420
problematic so that's where we were at

316
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,340
that point and if you focus on the semi

317
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,920
v4 cable that's the Southeast Asia

318
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:55,100
Middle East and Western Europe that's

319
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,589
what the cable connects that's some

320
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,600
information on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable and it seemed</font>

321
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,130
like the impact definitely had impacted

322
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,350
the connectivity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> India but also had</font>

323
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,410
impacted parts of Europe around Italy

324
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,920
and so now one other interesting thing

325
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:13,040
we saw is at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that this was</font>

326
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in the Europe and Asia region</font>

327
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,560
we noticed something<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting that</font>

328
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:21,390
traffic from Santiago in Chile was also

329
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,640
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going anywhere and I was some packet</font>

330
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:26,340
loss happening inside the Latin America

331
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,290
continent which was really weird and it

332
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,720
confused us a little bit on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how's this</font>

333
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,150
got anything to do with the with our

334
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,630
possible guess that's a cable event so

335
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:39,990
when we dug further we found that in

336
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,290
this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> th</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Parker was actually routing</font>

337
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,270
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are Miami and New Jersey to connect</font>

338
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe's component with the Latin</font>

339
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,460
America component and in addition what

340
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:54,210
was happening was right around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

341
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:56,370
time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed a lot of BGP issues this</font>

342
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,190
was data connect collected from the BGP

343
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,770
hearing such peering data from tia

344
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,510
sparkle and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues were not local</font>

345
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,670
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe now the issues were being</font>

346
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,950
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> countries including Argentina</font>

347
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,959
where we saw some issues in reach

348
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,520
ability of different prefixes different

349
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">size prefixes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was pretty</font>

350
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,819
interesting to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripple effect go</font>

351
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:18,839
across Europe and Asia and then finally

352
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some point there was an</font>

353
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">acknowledgment on the cvv outage and the</font>

354
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,459
the the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was put on the on the</font>

355
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,830
public forums was that the segment for

356
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,500
was the fault or segment for was the

357
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,190
likely cause which connects I believe

358
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,190
Cairo to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marcello</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we actually</font>

359
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,260
noticed that the the issue could likely

360
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,600
be a smaller segments of that which was

361
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,189
been in Palermo and MRSA and were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

362
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,839
really sure which exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but our</font>

363
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,230
data was suggesting a smaller segments

364
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,800
potentially being the issue so just a

365
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:58,560
recap when we talk about undersea cables

366
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,390
and so on we all know that it's it can

367
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,390
cause major<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptions because these</font>

368
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,949
are not things you can fix easily we

369
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,740
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that when things like this</font>

370
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,600
happen it's impacting multiple isps we

371
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,480
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of BGP routing changes that</font>

372
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,529
are being done to to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around some of</font>

373
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,440
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues but one other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment here</font>

374
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:22,589
which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very interesting is a lot</font>

375
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on packet loss and one</font>

376
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the indicators that can often be an</font>

377
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,869
early indicator of something going wrong

378
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,640
at the network layer is a jitter and we

379
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,190
found various situations in which jitter

380
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,170
variances if you catch them early

381
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,060
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> early indicators of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> potential</font>

382
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,229

383
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,579
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was really interesting and</font>

384
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,890
some of the measurements we're doing now

385
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,360
going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> is focusing on seeing if</font>

386
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:46,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a phenomenon that applies across</font>

387
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,180
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of events so with that</font>

388
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the final event and I'm</font>

389
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving through this quickly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

390
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">about eight minutes or so per event this</font>

391
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,790
is an AWS route leak event and we've

392
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,829
seen route leaks and hijacks covered

393
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,740
extensively at nanog so this is not new

394
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,540
to this audience but yet another<font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

395
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,250
so we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this in detail and</font>

396
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,709
then I know there's a talk later today

397
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,300
as well if you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

398
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,280
another talk later in the evening that

399
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,880
also talks about bgp hijacks which looks

400
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,470
interesting so that shows you it obvious

401
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,500
routes on a normal day so at the center

402
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:23,040
of that graph up there is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn for</font>

403
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Amazon West pws and then all the</font>

404
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,930
connectivity is the the pairing of the

405
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,550
upstream that Amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> is using its it's</font>

406
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,530
pretty aggressively appeared as you can

407
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,780
see and I'm sure there are others that

408
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,870
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't capture as well so the usual</font>

409
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,760
suspects I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttts Parker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Talia sanctuary</font>

410
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,350
think are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all part of that hearing</font>

411
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,850
ecosystem now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how traffic would</font>

412
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,920
look from one of the locations in

413
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,020
Portland going to Amazon this is Amazon

414
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,510
East right so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> transiting the</font>

415
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,210
country in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going through</font>

416
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,700
hurricane electric in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chicago and then</font>

417
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,050
hand it off to AWS who that<font color="#E5E5E5"> calls it on</font>

418
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,900
their backbone so that's how this

419
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:04,198
traffic flows from Oregon a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portland to</font>

420
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,849
AWS<font color="#CCCCCC"> East and now there was a period of</font>

421
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">time here so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before I get there there's</font>

422
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:10,948
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn map in this case so</font>

423
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Amazon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> curing with hurricane electric</font>

424
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:16,920
and then hurricane in this case

425
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,020
advertising 246 841 from where we're

426
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,120
receiving a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP feed so i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

427
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus on this for a second there is a</font>

428
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,479
great out section on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom which</font>

429
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,730
I'll come to in the later half of the

430
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,890
talk but this is a typical bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> path that</font>

431
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:34,940
we see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> block in question for this</font>

432
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:38,100
particular event was /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2054 239 16 / 20</font>

433
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:41,100
so that's what life was when<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

434
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,149
was good<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a sudden what we</font>

435
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,600
saw was when we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

436
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,270
network trace traffic

437
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,280
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portland is terminating in Zurich</font>

438
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,809
which was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird because it's</font>

439
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,820
supposed to be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the east coast</font>

440
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the United States but instead it's</font>

441
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,629
going to Zurich so the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paths</font>

442
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,210
that we see is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually crossing a</font>

443
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,860
continent and terminating something

444
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,130
clearly seemed wrong at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of</font>

445
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,750
time and as we looked into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a little</font>

446
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:11,230
bit further we noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> some interesting</font>

447
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,590
things on the BGP slide so remember the

448
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:16,270
block we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about was a / 20 and</font>

449
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,360
what we saw here was there were two new

450
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,860
/ 20 ones for the same block that were

451
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,240
being announced at that particular point

452
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:29,168
of time highlighting again the way this

453
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:33,640
graph lays out the green node is 650 to

454
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:35,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">1 which is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> private es number again the</font>

455
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,600
origin which is originating that block

456
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,049
that block was announced to you know

457
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,610
field which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 759 which then passed</font>

458
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:45,010
it on to hurricane electric and

459
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:47,678
hurricane electric managed to propagate

460
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,870
it further so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we saw at the</font>

461
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP level which was really interesting</font>

462
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,699
so clearly there was something weird

463
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and if I summarize it in</font>

464
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:01,390
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a Mickey Mouse diagram as</font>

465
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:05,168
some of some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> often call this its</font>

466
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:07,000
private ESN leaking a / 21 block<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

467
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:09,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">hurricane electric which was accepted</font>

468
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,710
and then passed forward and what made

469
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:13,840
this particularly worse was there wasn't

470
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">a contention for a slashed when you buy</font>

471
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">three different providers it was</font>

472
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,380
actually a more specific block and that

473
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:24,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">made it a lot worse from the standpoint</font>

474
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,350
of impact this was though not as global

475
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,330
as some of the other hijacks because

476
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,699
from what we could tell it was primarily

477
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:34,870
through this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> path that it</font>

478
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:37,720
created some disturbance and then when

479
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">we looked at the the actual incident and</font>

480
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,539
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> explanation that was given it turned</font>

481
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:45,309
out that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an accidental leak that</font>

482
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:47,260
happened and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a chi</font>

483
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,080
which eventually passed it on to its

484
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">peers or customers we've got some</font>

485
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,470
indication that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a route optimizer</font>

486
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,409

488
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:01,490
don't have confirmed data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

489

exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened and why that occurred</font>

490
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,799
the way does it did and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

491
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">very similar to another incident that</font>

492
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,850
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with n zoo in 2015 which you</font>

493

indications again route<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak indications</font>

495
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,370
and we've talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this at nano</font>

496
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,980
quite a lot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look out for you suddenly see</font>

498
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,490
a new prefix which is more specific

499
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,289
that's usually a sign that there's

500
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">something weird going on or a new</font>

501
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:32,990
destination is both of which were seen

502
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,639
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case you also often notice major</font>

503
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,980
BGP route changes and when I say major

504
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,230
it means the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP path significantly</font>

505
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,179
changes you all of a sudden see these

506
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,620
are these new<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s numbers in a path</font>

507
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,090
which you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen before and</font>

508
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,678
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually a good indication that</font>

509
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,908
something is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

510
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,429
geolocation is another interesting thing

511
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:55,190
so in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can notice that in a</font>

512
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:59,000
field<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a sweet 16 in the BGP path but</font>

513
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,890
also you noticed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the layer 3 traces</font>

514
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,470
that there was packet loss at a

515
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,870
geography which was not really part of

516
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,890
or supposed to be part of your path

517
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:10,479
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make any sense so that's also</font>

518
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">another indication of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leak so</font>

519
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,280
just as somebody we covered three events

520
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:18,590
today one was a DDoS attack which was

521
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,330
not really some Fault in the

522
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure as much as just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stress on</font>

523
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,918
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw that any</font>

524
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,809
cast made a big difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

525
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,490
could tell capacity also mattered so any

526
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,379
cost and capacity as a combination if

527
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do it right is is a good way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

528
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">with some of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about the</font>

529
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:39,080
submarine cable fault event which

530
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,629
impacted a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different regions India</font>

Asia India Asia broader India and

the route leak which this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this</font>

535
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,590
one of the ones that i always<font color="#E5E5E5"> find very</font>

536
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,000
interesting because when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

537
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,010
route leak you can never predict what's

538
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,030
going to happen it really depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

539
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:01,610
bgp picks it up and how its propagated

540
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:03,770
so that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have a few more</font>

suffered a cut in March 2013 and these

incidents are pretty pretty major and

there's widespread you know downstream
