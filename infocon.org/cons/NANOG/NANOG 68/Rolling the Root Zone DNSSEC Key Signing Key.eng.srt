6
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:30,448
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to embark on a project to</font>

7
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:33,540
change a configuration parameter in DNS

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,400
SEC for operators out there this may or

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,310
may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is going to</font>

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I intend to do here is to inform you</font>

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,710
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on give you an idea what's</font>

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,260
happening when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to happen why</font>

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,310
it matters and in particular we're

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,170
highlighting that we have some

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,820
documented plans available on the web

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">for you to consult so to give it back</font>

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,190
round twos told this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,360
general audience on a DNS crowd do a

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of background of what this</font>

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,710
matters and why this matters and what

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,899
where this fits in the scheme of things

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,700
dns for those don't like protocols you

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,579
ask a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> and an answer comes back</font>

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,619
and for DNS SEC a digital signatures

26
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,600
added to that response and the idea is

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">that de stijl signature now can let the</font>

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,449
receiver do some verification or some

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,060
validation of what they received what is

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,130
d a sec validation it's taking this

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,509
digital signature looking at what's in

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,449
the signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> deciding whether that</font>

33
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,159
signature is valid invalid or so on and

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,909
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that being conclude whether the</font>

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,079
data they receive you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> received is</font>

36
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,479
genuinely what you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

37
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,818
<font color="#E5E5E5">been receiving now cryptic the</font>

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,710
validation process we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

39
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,869
the cryptography part of this the

40
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,699
digital signature is a digital yep it's

41
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,889
a cryptographic piece of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,990
checked by a key<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

43
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:55,199
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this work but keep mine there</font>

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,089
are other factors in here is the answer

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,969
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question as part of this</font>

46
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,499
is the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> fresh is it just has been</font>

47
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,270
replay from the past or is it new is in

48
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:04,708
there I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick to just the</font>

49
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,240
cryptography side of this because we're

50
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,300
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key the key management</font>

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,060
is going on so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go further to</font>

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,770
the one of the obvious questions is why

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,120
should I bother with this validation why

54
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,760
is the dance like verification or

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,850
validation something that is interesting

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,769
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Dinah's protocol</font>

57
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,480
all is easily fooled it's constantly

58
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,060
asking questions getting back answers

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,679
and if it's not careful it can be very

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,540
gullible and pick up bad data be

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,850
redirected to places all over give you

62
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,850
the wrong responses for addresses for

63
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,760
machines and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so validation is</font>

64
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,019
basically a form of self-protection

65
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,269
anyone you running a DNS server out

66
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,490
there a caching server the<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers ask</font>

67
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,720
questions if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to make sure what</font>

68
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,820
you're caching what you're answering

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,710
your clients with is right you really

70
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to go out and do this form of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">self-protection there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

72
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,110
can use the in a second of the future

73
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,370
which I won't spend much time on but I

74
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:00,050
have listed their help now before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font>

75
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,980
through much of this talk i can have to

76
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,590
step into a puddle of detail in within

77
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,880
DNS SEC we have roles of keys and we

78
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,590
have different records that are involved

79
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and I need to explain a little bit</font>

80
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,030
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for the talk to make a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

81
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,310
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense up we have a key signing</font>

82
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,280
key that's a special key that only signs

83
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,130
other keys it just does don't ask why<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font>

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,840
there's a zs k which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a zone signing</font>

85
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,690
key which signs all the zone data all

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data in DNS that's not keys up these</font>

87
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">are conventions for operating this and</font>

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we have a third thing it's actually</font>

89
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,760
a record not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key so much is called the</font>

90
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">d/s and it's a pointer to a key that</font>

91
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,549
lets<font color="#E5E5E5"> us link up the security throughout</font>

92
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,640
the tree now this setup was supposed to

93
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,020
make operations simple and it doesn't

94
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,619
hurt operations but it makes it really

95
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:51,380
hard to explain everything so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

96
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the the boxes here when you want to</font>

97
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,640
crypto check the signature you take the

98
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,839
data which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue on top you take a</font>

99
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,910
digital signature which is in the middle

100
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,340
which has information about who signed

101
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,410
this and when they sign it and whether

102
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,570
what the checksum should be basically

103
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,520
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this key on the</font>

104
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,510
bottom as<font color="#E5E5E5"> esk his own signing key is</font>

105
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,240
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be at the bottom of this</font>

106
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture and the operat the output of</font>

107
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that operation is either thumbs up or</font>

108
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,630
thumbs down there's no almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

109
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,620
either yes or no because cryptography is

110
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:23,810
that is an exact hit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not now this key</font>

111
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,310
at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the CSK the bomb in</font>

112
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">this chart is what we're starting to</font>

113
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,910
link in to the topic here it's actually

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,219
backed up by a

115
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,170
a chain of other keys and then a show on

116
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,120
the top down the route<font color="#CCCCCC"> KS came with a</font>

119
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,860
is a chain of keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets involved in</font>

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,020
DNS SEC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about DNS SEC</font>

121
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,960
validation you get the data you get the

122
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,820
key<font color="#E5E5E5"> you validate that that that little</font>

123
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,799
three those three boxes work together

124
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,210
but you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure the key is</font>

125
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,190
reliable and that's why you're chaining

126
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,159
back up to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you can play some</font>

127
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of trust in now the reason why this</font>

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,300
is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explain in a few</font>

129
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,340
slides is that in reality that simple

130
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,040
chain downwards just one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to the</font>

131
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,229
data that was involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this example</font>

132
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,110
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality today the root zone KSK</font>

133
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:17,350
signs the root zones<font color="#E5E5E5"> esk which then</font>

134
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,270
science about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1300 to 1400 des records</font>

135
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,420
pointing to all the TL DS all top-level

136
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:26,530
names out there that's right away a fan

137
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,570
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 1300 dot-com itself also has 500</font>

138
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,250
DS records within it so it goes out even

139
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,830
further and dotcom isn't it

140
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,900
representative it's just the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

141
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,580
out there of course and 500 k is way

142
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,750
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than any other of the TL DS out</font>

143
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,919
there so getting back to the topic of

144
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,370
this talk this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about the root zone</font>

these chains it's a thing that sits on

it's what an operator pulls full full

157
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,350
faith and trust in this key is a special

158
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,480
key this key is going to be a key that

159
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,250
you trust it's like the certificates in

160
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,780
the web browser that then gets that then

161

sign other certificates when in web

162
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,400
pages this is a key that you have to

163
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,410
have trust and now the trust might be

164
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,570
implicit it might be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

download mind you download unbound and

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,980
you roll it out there powered<font color="#E5E5E5"> in s</font>

whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have some copy of this</font>

168

key sitting somewhere and you just trust

169
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,969
it because I code was also trusted or

170
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,470
you could be a much more likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to</font>

171
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,510
do an explicit check of this

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,950
trust anchor is a thing that you're

178
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,700
hinging all of your decisions on if

179
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,830
you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> DSF validation a first</font>

180
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,650
question here is the root zone<font color="#CCCCCC"> KSK the</font>

181
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,500
key that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about the trust</font>

182
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,359
anchor and the answer is it depends it's

183
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,850
up to you the trust anchor is something

184
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,710
you choose locally to run your recursive

185
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,630
servers for validation and so on it's up

186
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,409
to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide whether you trust that</font>

187
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,810
but the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> convention the root zone KSK</font>

188
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,370
KSK covers just about anything that's

189
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,440
operationally hooked together right now

190
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,840
in DNS second there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are holes in the</font>

191
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,300
tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now where things aren't</font>

192
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,310
signed properly this you can add other

193
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,600
trust anchors in your code if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel</font>

194
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">like managing it that way but if you're</font>

195
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,260
doing that scale you probably aren't

196
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,590
going to have too many of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> turnkey</font>

197
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:46,060
or extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> aquis ins installed but tools</font>

198
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,950

199
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,810
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some more background of how the</font>

202

way of course there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two bodies</font>

203
00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:00,549
involved right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now as I can we rely on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

204
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,000
functions and part of that is to run the

205
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,710
root zone KSK verisign is the roots on

206
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
maintainer they've been producing the

207

root zone for years they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been sending</font>

208
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,680
it out to the root server operators as

209
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,960
part of that function they operate their

210
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,640
root zones esk the zone signing key

211
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,820
that's why I bothered to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain the two</font>

212
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,280
differences the KSK means we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the KSK we created it once we're</font>

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:31,090
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to sign the CSK once a quarter</font>

every of so<font color="#E5E5E5"> four times a year operating</font>

218
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,679
the CSK verisign does this work they

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,390
they manage this life cycle of it and

220
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,189
they also sign the root zone with it

221
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,830
every time they send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a new copy of</font>

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,450
the root zone the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our two</font>

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,750
separately but we're also very

225
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,970
coordinated we talk all the time but

226
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,700
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing separate jobs and this helps</font>

227
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,810
up make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're securing the the</font>

can also check other operates and make

it and you may have levels of trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

271
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,940
you have that you want to meet trust on

it's it's whatever you fits your needs

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:43,260
so changing the root k sk we have a plan

in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the cake the key and</font>

in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plans have been out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,050
eight days we start the process by

280
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:50,339
creating the new key and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be</font>

281
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,709
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we do but it won't be</font>

282
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,269
visible to the public so you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

283
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:56,250
the plans and have some chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

284
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:58,709
this still so got quite some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

285
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,480
prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this though up what's really</font>

286
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:03,839
precedent-setting about this plan is

287
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,829
this project is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can is</font>

288
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,970
going to do something we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

289
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,739
a few commands we're going to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

290
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">new key and we're getting ready to sign</font>

291
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,440
with it the problem is is that everyone

292
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,120
else out there who wants to

293
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,670
set up a trust anchor based on the key

294
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,070
has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it and in and then also</font>

295
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,439
configure it we don't know who<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

296
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,910
there's no roster of who needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

297
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,980
this key we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to everybody to</font>

298
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,719
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if you need to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

299
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,160
here it is that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do and</font>

300
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,960
that's why we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and making</font>

301
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,939
sure we you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> project it's</font>

302
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,280
there were no analogies I could find in

303
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,130
any other projects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the scale of</font>

304
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's me and everyone else or at no one</font>

305
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:42,790
else I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know anything could it go</font>

306
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,920
out here so the the one thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep we</font>

307
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,260
keep mind is that there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a</font>

308
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,610
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the key right now because</font>

309
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,319
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem it's there's no</font>

310
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,330
emergency going on the key is not

311
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,460
wearing down<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not losing bits over</font>

312
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,980
time it's not losing air or whatever but

313
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,800
the change is being done first of all

314
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,660
because cryptographic assets don't live

315
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,729
forever at some point they will become

316
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,959
not unworkable e not secret um and

317
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,880
secondly though it's for operational

318
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,380
hygiene we want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can</font>

319
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,570
change the key in normal situations

320
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,480
without an emergency with<font color="#E5E5E5"> level heads</font>

321
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,340
and planning before we try to have to do

322
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,720
is in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

323
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,700
boat sinking we have to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> figuring</font>

324
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,460
how to use a life preservers but so

325
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going through this process of</font>

326
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,960
doing this just to make sure we can do

327
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it's an operational best practice and</font>

328
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,750
why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this privately why not test</font>

329
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,240
bed this because part of what we're

330
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,520
learning is it's the elements outside of

331
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,110
our control outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our operations</font>

332
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,090
area that need to be updated we're

333
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,710
making better contacts with software

334
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,810
developers with this distribution chain

335
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,460
of DNS out there with operators we're

336
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,319
trying to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we know who</font>

337
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,760
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know we're getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

338
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,500
need to know this and how and why and

339
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,300
when now so the bottom line is if for

340
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,180
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root the root KSK change will</font>

341
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,800
impact us about aldi<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like validations</font>

342
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,839
if if someone out there is validating

343
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,180
today and they don't update their trust

344
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,830
anchor in time the entire internet will

345
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">go off for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them they'll get surf fail</font>

346
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,270
for everything not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

347
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,860
signed everything because you can't

348
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,199
prove anything if you expect security to

349
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,150
be there you get no security data DNS

350
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,930
second say something's going on it drops

351
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,100
everything now so this time trust anchor

352
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,209
maintenance is going to be as something

353
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to start building some</font>

354
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,240
awareness of and it's a good time to

355
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,560
start thinking about

356
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,420
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we trust any of the cryptographic</font>

357
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,209
assets we have in our operations is a

358
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,819
good time to look at that so the project

359
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the project is meaningful if you're</font>

360
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,080
doing gesek validation Jeff<font color="#CCCCCC"> Houston's</font>

361
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,180
measurements indicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fifteen</font>

362
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,390
percent of resolvers out there actually

363
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing some dns sex so it's not zero it's</font>

364
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,790
not a lot somewhere in between people

365
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,260
need to hear this the whole process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

366
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,969
signing is not affected since all about

367
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,640
validation running recursive service

368
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,709
serving users out there and if you're

369
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,990
validating it's a time to begin to think

370
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,670
about preparing for this role out there

371
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,130
and Frank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still have quite a bit of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">time but this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the first warning I</font>

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,219
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of unprecedented so we</font>

376
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,580
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of on the ball for</font>

377
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,610
this up we have some documents out there

378
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,600
that if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make you aware of I</font>

379
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,390
the documents listed here they're

382
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,399
looking for formal feedback we don't

383
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,810
have a formal feedback mechanism but if

384
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,630
you see something wrong in them please

385
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,369
let us know we're not perfect but we've

386
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,470
gone through a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of process a long</font>

process to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear listen to it but</font>

388
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,940
we're not setting aside a special time

389
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,800
to get more feedback on this according

390
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the plans big holidays on october</font>

eleventh in 2017 which is about 51 weeks

392
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,480
from now we will we plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start using</font>

393
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,779
the new key and getting rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the old</font>

key in operations<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have 51 weeks</font>

395

to get ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this event right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

396
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,939
there are other significant events along

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,880
the way that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a bit</font>

398
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,959
about but in the plants we're using for

399
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,339
those you're curious we're going to use

400
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,599
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of key we're using now</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not changing the cryptographic</font>

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,440
algorithms out there the libraries and

00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:10,149
all be the same we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> following</font>

404
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,940
something called the automated updates

or dsi trust anchors this is RFC 50 11

406
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,990
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know those numbers that's a way</font>

408
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,100
look at the key and decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether you</font>

want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not up this is taking a</font>

410
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,670
quite a while because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

411
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,529
rush there is an emergency<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have</font>

412
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,290
to but so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at a slower</font>

413
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,640
pace and we're fitting into existing

414
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,099
events that we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's</font>

415
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,360
no extra cost in operations to doing

416
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,579
this the way we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

417
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,620
we're also beefing up testing and

418
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:41,050
monitoring of the systems involved

419
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,390
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can detect stress on the</font>

420
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:48,099
system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can also help operate</font>

421
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:49,630
prepare for what's coming up I in doing

422
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,370
this work we had a few concerns and I

423
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,830
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let folks look at this and you</font>

424
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,650
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna consider this as things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

425
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,690
look out look look for it during our

426
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,250
plant during the plan roll the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

427
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,050
response is some of the responses that

428
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to matter i'm not quantifying</font>

429
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:08,650
which ones may grow as high as 1425

430
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">bytes some experimentation with ipv6 is</font>

431
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,370
that might be kind of interesting on the

432
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">network to see if it goes that big</font>

433
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,260
before fragmentation kicks in up the odd

434
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,510
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is though empirically people have</font>

435
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,460
we have we know of many examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds</font>

436
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,170
running with very large key sets even

437
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,410
larger than that and we've never had

438
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,510
anyone cry foul or error or a problem

439
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,800
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so we're we're done we don't</font>

440
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,330
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's actually going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

441
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,170
problem but we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're watching</font>

442
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,840
out and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that we are</font>

443
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to design around for operators</font>

444
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,950
out there anyone who's running DNS

445
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,920
servers things to look out for is one

446
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,260
thing keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp open for you for the dns</font>

447
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,650
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nowt the DA's protocol</font>

448
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,810
natively will fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tcp if it</font>

449
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't get it through UDP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

450
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,699
open and really try to restrict

451
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,100
filtering based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns message size that</font>

452
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,350
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a big problem less so now but</font>

453
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">just make sure that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let dns</font>

454
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:05,310
determine what size message it has to

455
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,180
pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and forth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i I've use ipv6</font>

456
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,849
fragmentation where that why that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

457
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,160
issue is in v6 that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> network no</font>

458
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:14,980
longer fragments so you have to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

459
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,990
things according to the maximum transfer

460
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,819
unit to begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> with if you don't you get</font>

461
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,270
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in error message saying this was</font>

462
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,490
too baby dns has no memory so once it

463
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,720
sends a sense of message and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's told</font>

464
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,829
that was too big it forgot what its

465
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,360
scent and it's not going to doing any

466
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,720
good so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns is kind of</font>

467
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,939
feeling the pinch in this area but Jeff

468
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,220
Houston has an<font color="#E5E5E5"> article which I would</font>

469
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,470
love to summarize in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk but don't</font>

470
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,440
have enough time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that it's at the</font>

471
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:44,530
URL there is from May of this year was

472
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,260
in his up on his pottery dotnet account

473
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">is P column</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's called and he</font>

474
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,049
talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the MTU settings in the</font>

475
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,639
information behind that

476
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,799
there were some good informations in

477
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,178
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a button quotes on my</font>

478
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,980
slide because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have taken</font>

479
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:00,889
three or four slides to explain and I

480
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,210
don't have the time for that but I would

481
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:04,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">courage you take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that article</font>

482
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,529
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have an interest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in v6 and what's</font>

483
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:07,820
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this and look at some of</font>

484
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:11,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the MTU settings you have on the</font>

computers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a server so</font>

486
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:13,850
dates to watch the first date<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

487
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:16,100
actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention is not on here</font>

488
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,869
in eight days we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create the</font>

489
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,269
key the new key will be created in eight

days<font color="#CCCCCC"> from now at a key ceremony in</font>

00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:24,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">culpeper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> West Virginia that's not going</font>

to be visible event so we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

493
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,590
on the slide but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's eight days</font>

494
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:31,159
away it seems kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

495
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:34,609
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about um in September 19th and 2017</font>

496
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,340
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put some of the keys into</font>

497
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:39,970
the DNS or put the keys the DNS actually

498
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,619
it's a role as it's a long story but

499
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">remove it more information of the DNS on</font>

500
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:46,309
that date and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first week in the</font>

501
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,379
response size will grow to 14 14 bytes

502
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,970
which is above a threshold as some of us

503
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:52,369
are concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to watch</font>

504
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,940
what happens there if nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes wrong</font>

505
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:57,109
we is acceptable we keep rolling on for

506
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,090
the next 20 days we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large</font>

507
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:01,100
set of compared to today today it's

508
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,830
about maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight hundred bites i think</font>

509
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,019
or 1100<font color="#E5E5E5"> bites of the highest it's going</font>

510
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,489
to go to 14 14 then we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch out</font>

511
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,399
for that operators will price may see

512
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:12,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">that more than anything else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on october</font>

513
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,959
eleventh we change the keys and that's

514
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:16,399
basically swapping the new key in for

515
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,629
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old key coming out and if you</font>

516
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:19,189
haven't kept up don't have the keys

517
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:21,859
configured everything goes dark I

518
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,779
January 11th we go through the process

519
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:26,418
of revoking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lp formally and that's</font>

520
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:29,330
when we go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1425 bites again another</font>

521
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:31,759
new high at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point for the potential</font>

522
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,350
fragmentation exists so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

523
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,850
three main dates for operators looking

524
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,649
out there you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> these dates are</font>

525
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,238
nearly a year into the future so we're

526
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:40,729
we have some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prepare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

527
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:43,519
still but what are you doing the

528
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,289
meantime look at how you do trusting and

529
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,059
configuration how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust and</font>

530
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:50,330
configuring trust and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your DNS servers</font>

531
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:53,090
and probably other places too how do you

532
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">do configuration control do you how do</font>

533
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,418
you manage your DNS servers out there

534
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,519
the reason why I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font>

535
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:00,230
automated updates of DSi trust anchors

536
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:03,169
the middle bullet there which is RFC 50

537
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,519
11 assumes that you let your your

538
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,259
servers self-managed

539
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,549
these servers will go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

540
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:09,379
they'll do some queries and they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

541
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:11,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh a new trust anchor in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah adopt</font>

542
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:13,218
that by myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do centralized</font>

543
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:14,478
configuration management you may not

544
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:16,879
want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen to your network</font>

545
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,349
so you have to you might want to account

546
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:20,149
for that some way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may want to have</font>

547
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:21,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">another server do that and then tell</font>

548
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:24,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">your centralized servers that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push</font>

549
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,989
things out we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe some</font>

550
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:28,070
preparation in pushing this out there

551
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:29,450
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the alternate to that is you</font>

552
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,830
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the automated updates</font>

553
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,599
you can do it all manually push it out

554
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,208
yourself but then you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

555
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:38,869
aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you're trusting also a</font>

556
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:40,239
newer feature of the DNS out there is

557
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:42,708
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative trust anchor management</font>

558
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:45,019
this is now appearing in more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

559
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:47,539
of them more recent versions of software

560
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:50,450

an outcome of one of the frames example

of nasa.gov screwing up or messing up

working with software developers and

00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,139
tool developers to look at having better

574
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:25,849
tooling out there for this we've talked

575
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:27,619
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the operators already who</font>

thought the opposite software developers

00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,269
making them aware of this we're also

579
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,249
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure they know of the new keys</font>

580
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:36,679
when the keys are available so they can

put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in their software there are tests</font>
