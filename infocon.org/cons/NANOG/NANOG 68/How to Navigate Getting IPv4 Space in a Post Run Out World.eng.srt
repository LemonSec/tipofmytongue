the vice president of Hilco streambank

and I run our IP address brokerage I'm a

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,840
little background on me for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,660
that don't know me and people<font color="#CCCCCC"> always ask</font>

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,700
how I got into such a weird job and I

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,039
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> law school and where I</font>

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,509
specialize in intellectual property but

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,759
by the time I graduated I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

25
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:09,619
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> practicing so I found my</font>

26
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,319
company which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a boutique investment</font>

27
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:15,020
bank that specializes in intellectual

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:18,709
property and other intangible assets we

29
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,679
got into the IP address market shortly

30
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:24,679
after the very first large publicly

31
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:27,109
known sale of IP addresses because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

32
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:29,389
were handling asset sales for the

33
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:32,089
bankruptcy estates of borders in circuit

34
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:34,789
city and it turned out that they had IP

35
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,639
addresses as well so we sold those and

36
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,990
the business just developed from there

37
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:41,240
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective with a legal background</font>

38
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,689
and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization's perspective as</font>

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,068
handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> other types of asset sales has</font>

40
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:50,119
really colored the way that we've

41
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:52,880
approached the IP address market when I

42
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,069
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> started coming to conferences and</font>

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,289
handling all of these transactions there

44
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,539
was a lot of stigma attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the IP</font>

45
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:01,579
address market and I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

46
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,950
negative for everyone involved a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

47
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">people looked at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

48
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,340
thought that all of the players involved

49
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're doing these very sketchy things</font>

50
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,020
and all of these sales with these

51
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,700
underground<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey market sales and so</font>

52
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,460
they didn't engage in the same sort of

53
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,510
diligence and responsible behavior that

54
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with other types of</font>

55
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,200
purchases so really if there's one thing

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,298
that I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone to take from this</font>

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,700
talk is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to treat</font>

58
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,250
this type of a sale like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would any</font>

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,349
other major purchase that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,849
engaging in for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company handle it</font>

61
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:38,429
responsibly do your diligence and work

62
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,899
with people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

63
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,290
start out with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little background on</font>

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,959
the IP address market or why you have to

65
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,540
pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that was free so</font>

66
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,430
traditionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primary source for IP</font>

67
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,129
addresses were the regional internet

68
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,799
registries and their predecessors in the

69
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,950
very early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of the internet you got</font>

70
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:02,489
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three sizes of IP address blocks</font>

71
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:06,869
you either received 256 addresses 65,000

72
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:08,670
or 16.7 million at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time the</font>

73
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,389
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of evidence that was required</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

74
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,458
receive a block of IP addresses was much

75
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:16,200
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is today so there were tons</font>

76
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,720
of organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> got much more</font>

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,608
space than they actually needed as well

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a handful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of organizations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that never</font>

79
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:25,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">even used the space that was handed to</font>

80
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,480
them with<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 4.3 billion ipv4</font>

81
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,030
addresses and a growing internet this

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:37,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">became more and more of a problem as</font>

83
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:39,090
exhaustion progressed so at at this

84
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a few years ago back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2009</font>

85
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,760
Aaron stepped in and implemented their

86
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,099
first transfer policy that allowed

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,679
organizations that had excess space to

88
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,589
transfer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recipients that</font>

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually needed it and this helps to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">address this sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss allocation</font>

91
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,730
problem that had<font color="#E5E5E5"> arisen back in the 90s</font>

92
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:02,819
and from there the market continued to

93
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,099
progress in the early days of market

94
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,260
Aaron and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other re are still had</font>

95
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,149
some free pools of space<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were</font>

96
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,690
handing out you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to see in a</font>

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:16,340
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides the interesting impact</font>

98
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,858
that has had on pricing but

99
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:23,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately as of September of 2015</font>

100
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:28,380
air no longer has a free pool of address

101
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,380
space so now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to pay for it so</font>

102
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently</font>

103
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,010
if you don't want to pay for you can

104
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">take your chances on errands waiting</font>

106
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,640
you would have previously to receive

107
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,280
space directly from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron and they'll</font>

108

put you on their waiting list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as</font>

allowed to transfer 24-month amount of

128
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,860
space so you might want to provide them

129
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,150
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that justification information from</font>

130
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:43,090
the beginning so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

131
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:46,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">go back and do that over again so here</font>

132
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,090
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of v4 delegations</font>

133
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,640
that aaron has given out in 2016 there

134
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,500
was a chunk of them in May when Aaron

135
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,130
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of space returned to</font>

136
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,990
them but for the most part you're stuck

137
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:03,130
sitting around waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the waiting</font>

138
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,360
list and contrast here are the transfers

139
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,100
that have been occurring at the same

140
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,510
time so that's the transfer market is

141
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,890
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you're stuck getting your</font>

142
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:13,030
space now in this region so what I want

149
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,230
into some of the problems that we've

150
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,230
seen less responsible organizations fall

151
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,610
into in the past so as a starting point

152
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,730
what you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assess your</font>

153
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,800
situation how much space<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you need as</font>

154
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,900
an organization there are two sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at this you can look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at how</font>

156
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,530

<font color="#E5E5E5">you can qualify for right now with Aaron</font>

159
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,480
because pricing does fluctuate quite a

160
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,880
bit and continues to increase a lot of

161
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,190
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have the funds are</font>

162
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,990
choosing to engage in futures contracts

163
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,360
where they purchase as much space as

164
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,610
they anticipate eating over say the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

165
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,890
five years and then transferring it to

their<font color="#CCCCCC"> an account</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over time as they're</font>

168
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,780
you're not interested in engaging that

169
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,340
long of a contract<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to just</font>

170
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,650
get the space you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> qualify for now</font>

171
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,510
you can purchase space and just

172
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,210
immediately<font color="#CCCCCC"> transfer that 24 month</font>

173

supply right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really the</font>

174
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,520
simplest way to go about doing that

175
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,800
something to keep in mind that's always

176
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,810
a really good idea is you can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

177
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,400
pre-approval with Aaron you provide them

178
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,260
all the justification information that

179
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
you normally would during the transfer

180
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,710
process ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time and then you'll</font>

181
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,120
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a document from there and saying</font>

182
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,680
that you know you are pre-approved for

183
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,330
this amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of space and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

184
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,090
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to have going forward</font>

185
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,609
when you are seeking out a seller of

186
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,250
space and entering into that contract so

187
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,450
you don't get stuck in a situation mid

188
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,250
transaction where it turns out you're

189
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">not able to qualify for as much space as</font>

190
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,030
you'd planned and you end up wasting a

191
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,190
lot of people's time and depending on

192
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,869
how you had your contract structured you

193
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,660
might end up losing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the space that you'd</font>

194
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,460
purchased with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that contact and</font>

195
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,990
have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back out onto the market at</font>

196
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,669
which point prices might be higher than

197
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,990
when you first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so it's</font>

198
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,120
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good idea to get your</font>

ducks in a row ahead of time apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

200
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,390
pre-approval and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

201
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,520
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there do I want to get</font>

202
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,500
just the amount of space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pre-approval</font>

203
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,700

space to enter into a futures contract

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:29,090
and and do it that way another thing

206
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is your</font>

207

timeline is this isn't something that

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,799
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just purchase and get tomorrow or a</font>

209
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">week from now oftentimes there are you</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract negotiations that take a</font>

211
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,590
while the transfer itself can take a

212
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,590
while so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> planning</font>

213
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,180
earlier than you necessarily would think

214
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,520
you do just so that you have enough time

215
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,930
is you're not stuck where your network

216
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,850
needs the space immediately and you

217
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,529
don't have it

218
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,120
so you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get started as early as</font>

219
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:57,040
possible and communicate your timing

220
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
needs to the other party so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

221
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,899
everyone is able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move as quickly as</font>

222
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,839
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get you what you need so the</font>

223
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:06,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">next issue is how much should you budget</font>

224
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,680
the ipv4 market is difficult because

225
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,660
there's not a kind of transparency out

226
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,670
there one thing I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> caution everyone</font>

227
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,719
about is when you read these new news

228
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,310
articles telling you that there are

229
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,230
addresses out there selling for a

230
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,149
hundred dollars per address I've never

231
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,339
seen addresses sell for that expensive

232
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:23,620
I've never seen a news article that

233
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,870
accurately quotes the price of a sale

234
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't listed in a public document</font>

235
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,069
like a bankruptcy estate sale so be

236
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,479
careful looking at news publications for

237
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,519
that sort of thing I'd suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

238
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach out to a number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

239
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,560
brokers and sellers to get a good idea

240
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pricing that's available because</font>

241
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,000
there's so little transparency sometimes

242
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,040
you see a lot of fluctuation between one

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,389
seller and another and so it's just

244
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">great to have as much information as a</font>

245
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:51,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cosmo moving forward here I've put</font>

246
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,810
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> some charts based on our</font>

247
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,620
private sales as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as publicly</font>

248
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:59,170
recorded sale prices in bankruptcy

249
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,610
bankruptcy sales so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all filled</font>

250
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,589
but I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like confirm the</font>

251
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,600
price of you can see some interesting

252
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:07,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">trends that have happened over time we</font>

253
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,209
starting back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2011 prices actually</font>

254
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,009
were higher than they<font color="#CCCCCC"> started to drop as</font>

255
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,229
I mentioned Aaron had not reached

256
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,269
exhaustion when the market first opened

257
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,769
up and so prices continue to drop

258
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,569
because people were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get the</font>

259
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,730
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free and there weren't as many</font>

260
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:24,579
people participating you can see right

261
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,100
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2015 was when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron hit</font>

262
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:30,729
exhaustion and prices started to

263
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:34,569
increase from there so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a /</font>

264
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:38,439
24 2016 and then I sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> group / 15</font>

265
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">plus into its own category here and the</font>

266
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:44,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-fours are the most expensive /</font>

267
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:46,180
address for the most part it's sort of

268
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,130
like Costco them the more of something

269
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy the better price per unit</font>

270
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:54,160
however a recent trend has started to

271
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:57,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">develop with the very large blocks so if</font>

272
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,930
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a 24 or something</font>

273
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,730
smaller yes you're going to pay a higher

274
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,620
price per unit but then once you start

275
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to /</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 16s and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> larger or</font>

276
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,310
I need to see an interesting trend where

277
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,870
prices are starting to pick back up from

278
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,449
there on a per unit basis because there

279
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,360
are so few large contiguous blocks of

280
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,150
space available one thing that new

281
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,040
entrance to the market tend to be

282
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,720
surprised by<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really not as</font>

283
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,640
much space out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you might think</font>

284
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,950
just looking at registry information

285
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,500
because there are a lot of large buyers

286
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,290
that have entered<font color="#E5E5E5"> into futures contracts</font>

287
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,150
so even though there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a flush</font>

291
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,699
that space to someone else and it's not

292
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,800
out there on the market so you do need

293

you have slightly different policies

307

something that new entrants are always

undertaking for organizations that

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't been doing a really amazing job</font>

373
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,969
of keeping track and planning their

374
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,660
networks internally so you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

375

this information ready to go when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

376
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,740
forward with purchasing the addresses so

377
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,590
you don't end up slowing down your

378
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:56,820
transaction and losing out on a deal

379
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:59,010
that you worked hard to set up on so

380
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,430
diligence is an incredibly important

381
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,290
aspect of purchasing IP address space

382
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,780
you need to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itself</font>

383
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,670
check out blacklist and anything else

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,800
relevant to the space<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to be</font>

385
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,020
important to your organization and make

386
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you do that before you have a</font>

387
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,040
contractual obligation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to purchase that</font>

388
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,290
space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it in two ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

389
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,209
can either do the diligence before even

390
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,069
entering into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract or you can</font>

391
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,720
make the contract subject to your

392
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful completion of the diligence</font>

you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little shorter</font>

395
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:34,050
timeline so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important</font>

396
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:38,579
things due diligence is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> seller the</font>

397
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:40,319
seller it fell so the first the first

<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of rule with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diligence me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

402
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,758

426
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,100
entities so while it does sometimes take

427
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:40,500
a few more weeks to go through buying

428
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,779
space from a bankruptcy estate sometimes

429
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,240
you get the strongest rights when doing

430
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:47,519
that and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in</font>

431
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind if you are working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a limited</font>

432
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">time line is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if this space is</font>

433
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,809
registered to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization that the</font>

00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:58,529
several years ago earth there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

436
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,959
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of M&A activity that happened in</font>

437
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,759
the past that needs to be updated in

438
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">erin's registry before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron's going to</font>

439
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">allow you to transfer that space to</font>

440
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,870
another party and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font>

441
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,750
take you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere from a week to a</font>

442
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:14,668
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on how how much</font>

443
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,470
documentation they have of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> M&A</font>

444
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:18,230
activity that occurred in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past and</font>

445
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,250
how ready they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present that to</font>

446
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,309
Aaron so if you're working on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited</font>

447
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,039
time frame make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

448
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:28,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">done ahead of time or you know check out</font>

449
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,450
your options with other sellers if the

450
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,770
cell you're working with still has to go

451
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,410
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that process and you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

452
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,860
with a limited time frame

453
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:39,690
um so one issue that has occurred

454
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,090
recently as there's been some problems

455
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,320
with registration hijacking so there

456
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,090
have been some organizations out there

457
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,240
that have been scanning Aaron's database

458
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,949
looking at these legacy resources that

459
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,780
are registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to organizations that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

460
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,580
longer exists and that haven't been

461
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,170
routed for a very long time they're

462
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,689
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there they're setting up a new</font>

463
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization by that same name and then</font>

464
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,890
they're making applications to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron to</font>

465
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,240
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take over that space in the</font>

466
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,420
hopes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of selling it and transferring it</font>

467
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,640
to third parties Aaron's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not more</font>

468
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,180
sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the way it's been</font>

469
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,920
tracking down this sort of activity and

470
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,450
is getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot better making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's</font>

471
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">not happening but there have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

472
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">handful of cases where this has</font>

473
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,280
successfully gone through and you don't

474
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,169
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be purchasing space from</font>

475
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,790
somebody who has entered<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some</font>

476
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,080
fraudulent activity and doesn't have the

477
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,379
rights to sell it to you in the first

478
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,300
place so one good place to start when

479
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,040
looking at the seller to make sure

480
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,290
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not engaging into an agreement</font>

481
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,050
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of fraudulent entity is</font>

482
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,830
you can look at the date that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the space</font>

483
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">is registered to that organization at so</font>

484
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,040
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that air and registration</font>

485
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,480
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be two dates on there</font>

486
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,670
there's the registration date there's

487
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last updated date if the</font>

488
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:53,100
registration date dates back to prior to

489
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,050
the existence of the company that's

490
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,330
selling you the space so say the

491
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,500
registration date is 1994 but you're

492
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,300
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a company that's only been</font>

493
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,980
around for two years that's an

494
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,500
indication that that company received

495
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,320
the space<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a mergers and acquisitions</font>

496
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,290
transfer and so you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

497
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">go back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and get evidence of the</font>

498
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,570
agreements<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the M&A activity that</font>

499
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,640
occurred that allowed them to just

500
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">successfully complete that 8.2 and make</font>

501
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you're satisfied with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chain of</font>

502
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">title documents that that they're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">providing you other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than that it's just</font>

504
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,320
sort of the same general things you look

505
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,790
out for<font color="#CCCCCC"> in any type of business</font>

506
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,510
agreement that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep an eye</font>

507
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:38,820
out for red flags and research into them

508
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,940
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know something's a little concerning</font>

509
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,760
recently I saw something where there's

510
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,650
some fraudulent activity and the

511
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,200
that was selling the space was 18 but

512
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,480
all of the documents he he was providing

513
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show evidence of the M&A activity he</font>

514
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,010
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been 12 years old when he</font>

515
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,840
signed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so sometimes you it's hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

516
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,700
pinpoint specific things did like a

517
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,860
checklist to look for but just keep an

518
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,660
eye out if it's an entity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

519
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,040
haven't worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with before four</font>

520
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,440
different red flags and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into things</font>

521
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that might you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know be a little</font>

522
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,760
concerning and research those because

523
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,370
there are an increasing number of

524
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,350
fraudulent actors participating in the

525
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,929
market and you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to waste your</font>

526
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">time and potentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lose money going</font>

527
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">through that going through that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

528
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,500
another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cautious of is</font>

529
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,390
anybody that comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says don't</font>

530
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,910

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron transfer fee and they thought</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that that was fine the</font>

539
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,910
reality of the situation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are</font>

540
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">receiving a transfer and Aaron you're</font>

541
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:52,560
going to have to provide them with all

542
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,700
sorts of documentation showing your need

543
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,770
for the space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're also going to</font>

544
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,090
have officers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

545
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,450
signing and notarizing documents

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:03,179
approving the transaction the sale with

547
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,590
Aaron so you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just pay an</font>

548
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,260
invoice and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part of</font>

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">this entire transaction process even if</font>

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,290
you're working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a broker or someone</font>

551
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,720
else that's handling a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font>

552
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,889
legwork<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you they should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be open with</font>

553

you throughout the process about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,060
different steps that are going on and

555
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,409
you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be at least aware of the</font>

556
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,879
process that's going on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will be</font>

557
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,290
signing these documents so just be

careful of anybody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says don't worry</font>

559
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,320
I got this I'll handle everything for

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,330
best thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protect you is to</font>

564
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,500
structure your contract in a way that

565
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,560
protects you from some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> risks so</font>

566
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,720
use an escrow account or delay payment

567
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,179
until after you've received transfer of

568
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> space don't give some money before</font>

569
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,530
the transfer has gone through at least

570
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,550
then if you are dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a Friday</font>

571
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,960
line after they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your money</font>

572
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">also they might have wasted some of your</font>

573
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,140
time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the structural</font>

574
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,300
protections in your contract

575
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,060
to keep you<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you know getting</font>

576

<font color="#E5E5E5">getting to hurt by any fraudulent actors</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may miss out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on and so in terms</font>

578
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,570
of structuring contracts there are two

579
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,889
really main elements of the contract

580
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you need to think about and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

581
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the timing of the transfers and the</font>

582
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,030
payments like I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

583
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,250
can either do an immediate transfer or

584
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:26,000
you can transfer the space / time via a

585
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:28,100
futures<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract and in both cases you</font>

586
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,660
typically use an escrow account hover

587
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,219
when you're doing the futures contract

588
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,480
sometimes the payments are split up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

589
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,280
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways sometimes you do a</font>

590
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">deposit and then you do like a pro rata</font>

591
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,960
payment over time it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on</font>

592
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">the interests of the parties but when</font>

593
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,170
you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a counterparty that</font>

594
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,610
you're not familiar with just be very

595
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,080
careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when you're making</font>

596
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,750
payments and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you have those</font>

597
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,040
structural protections in place so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

598
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:54,980
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not handing over your money</font>

599
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:57,200
before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get what you're paying for so</font>

600
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,320
just in general some tips for a smooth

601
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,030
smooth transfer process understand the

602
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">RA our policies understand how much</font>

603
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,930
space you can qualify<font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive and</font>

604
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,150
make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision about whether you want</font>

605
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just receive the amount that you can</font>

606
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">qualify for right now or if you want to</font>

607
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,180
pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a larger amount of space that</font>

608
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,530
you can transfer over our time in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font>

609
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,010
to save yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> money in the future</font>

610
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,600
with prices rise you need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

611
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,750
ducks in a row in terms of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

612
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,120
your justification evidence in place

that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very very time-consuming it</font>

614
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,489
i've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> some transfers fail and some</font>

615
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,810
organizations lose out on a great deal

616
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,420
that they had gotten earlier on because

617
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,060
it took them two months to complete the

618
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,770
the justification portion of the air and

621
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,250
much much more quickly throughout the

entire process<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for pre-approval</font>

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to check off a box and say okay</font>

to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again structure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

630
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,570
contracts to minimize risk use an escrow

631
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,250
account or delay payment don't give

632
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,100
someone here money until you have the

633
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,200
addresses

634
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,360
and pay attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your errand online</font>

635
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,830
account it seems like a silly thing but

636
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,189
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number one thing</font>

637
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,780
that slows down transfers is that the

638
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,340
companies participating just don't check

639
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,289
their hair and online account as often

640
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,580
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should and they end up losing a</font>

641
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:25,020
week even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though you know they have a</font>

642
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,909
broker<font color="#CCCCCC"> or somebody else involved calling</font>

643
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,039
and bugging them just keep checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

644
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:33,000
air and online account and be diligent

645
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that process yes so that's</font>

basically the over overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the land</font>

David can give you a totally different

an asset of the company you know

686
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:28,749
ignoring the asset stuff so what kind of

687

control were you looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for I guess I</font>

was more concerned about smaller

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,168
companies I mean that's where most of

694
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,519
the market is right most of the market

695
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:53,470
is in the buying and selling of /

696
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,710
twenty-fours and these are with

697
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,570
generally smaller entities and they

698
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:03,100
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any different control than a</font>

large company might so I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

701
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,830
works for the sellers and it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

702
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,919
the buyers because we're able to do

these transactions and you know while we

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,769
stood up here we were giving you things

705
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look out for and things you want to</font>

706
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:21,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">be careful of it really does work and if</font>

707
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,869
you have a / 24 that you have control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

708
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:24,519
it is really rightfully your the

709
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:27,189
registry enough you can sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

710
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:29,379
whomever you want and I as a buyer can

711
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,960
buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> from whoever I want and the rirs</font>

712
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:34,359
aren't in the way of that at all as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far</font>

713
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,909
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can see sure so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle a ton of</font>

714
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:40,389
really small sales I run an auction

715
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:42,369
platform specifically aimed at small

716
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:45,729
buyers and small sellers where we

717
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:47,109
automate the contract process to get a

718
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,730
lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurdles that the big guys</font>

719
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:50,320
have to deal with and all of the lawyers

720
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,700
out of the way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these smaller deals</font>

721
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,299
and they still have to go through that

722
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,679
Aaron transfer process and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

723
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more difficult for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them sometimes</font>

724
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,340
because they tend not to have as much

725
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,869
experience as the operators handling the

726
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,879
larger companies they haven't gone

727
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:05,559
through the process of getting faced

728
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:08,590
directly from Aaron so sometimes that's

729
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,749
an extra hurdle for them to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

730
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,220
with but they can still participate in

731
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:13,720
the policy development process like

732
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,309
anybody else can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can participate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

733
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,869
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pml you can come to the meetings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

734
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:18,639
talk if you have a problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

735
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:21,668
policies and how they're applying to

736
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:23,049
your organization so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see there</font>

737
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:24,519
being a huge difference between me

738
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,809
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the large guys and the small</font>

739
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,669
guys other than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the extra</font>

740
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:29,049
hurdle of getting your head around going

741
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the transfer process that you might</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not</font>

743
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:39,970
before okay thanks Kevin Bloomberg the

744
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:42,790
wire question for you first two quick

745
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,770
things first one is the aaron who was

746
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:47,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">serviced it wasn't really mentioned</font>

747
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,300
there have either of you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

748
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,420
service as a way of looking back at the

749
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,820
last 25 years of history related to

750
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,200
blocks is that within the terms things

751
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,689
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because it was a little</font>

752
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">ambiguous to me if as part of a transfer</font>

753
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,070
a buyer could look at the who was data

754
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,420
if that's allowed in the terms and if

755
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,689
you've used it in the past i really be

756
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,820
curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that and so i don't</font>

757
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,530
believe us technically allowed under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

758
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,820
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've seen who was used for</font>

759
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,230
slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> different purposes and then</font>

760
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,669
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten approval for a</font>

761
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,910
slightly different purpose use it for

762
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:22,210
that purpose as well i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure you'll</font>

763
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:24,670
probably better in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vein I used to</font>

764
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,080
tools as I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use right bar</font>

765
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:29,010
is because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the routing</font>

766
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,629
history I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see which a esas</font>

767
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,670
originated routes for the IP addresses

768
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:36,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm buying for as far back as history</font>

769
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:39,610
goes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ras goes back like you know</font>

770
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,860
decades it's wonderful who was as you're

771
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,689
alluding to is great because in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron it</font>

772
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,790
shows you the registration history at

773
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,350
each step which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can match up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

774
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,420
routing history so you put those two

775
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,750
tools together that's a fantastic tool

776
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,370
for seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big picture of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the block</font>

777
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,080
thank you and the i guess the second

778
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,209
part is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a statement just</font>

779
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be aware that within the air and we</font>

780
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,040
do have reserved blocks and there is a

781
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,439
policy right now that would lock those

782
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,409
up and prevent them being used in the

783
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Trina in part of the transfer market so</font>

784
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:15,040
it's also very important to know if a

785
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,050
block is part of a lockdown so in TP is

786
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">an example you weren't allowed to</font>

787
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,889
transfer for three years but there's no

788
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to necessarily know that without</font>

789
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:26,020
really digging into it yeah and that and

790
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,250
that's as buyers as engineers as

791
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,160
operators we can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected to know</font>

792
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,380
every little detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> about every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are IRS</font>

793
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,850
rules in every blocks history and that's

794
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,290
where as Amy was saying at a

795
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,570
presentation it's all about protecting

796
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself in the terms and conditions can</font>

797
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,240
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your money back if something</font>

798
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,980
went wrong

799
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,350
hi jean-christophe at DePaul University

800
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,760
two brief questions he<font color="#CCCCCC"> could choose who</font>

801
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,620
wants to answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the first you</font>

802
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,600
mentioned thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent fraud now</font>

803
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,320
wondering if there's any<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional</font>

804
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,810
pattern to that like should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I be more</font>

805
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,480
leery of fraud occurring with a / 16

806
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:02,129
versus a / 24 or not or or does it not

807
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,070
really necessarily matter second

808
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,780
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if I'm from a one-man shop</font>

809
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,090
but I've got a need for<font color="#CCCCCC"> just maybe a</font>

810
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,740
couple of / 24 zits few hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks it</font>

811
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,419
just based on my quick judgment of what

812
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,600
it might cost me at least just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

813
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">address space lawyers that sounds really</font>

814
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,350
expensive for just those two small

815
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,000
relatively assets you still recommend

816
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,639
going through an elaborate lawyer

817
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,220
process or how involved do i need to get

818
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,780
legal rep not a lawyer but how what

819
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,930
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i expect for legal</font>

820
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:33,260
representation even for relatively small

821
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:36,110
purchase purchases in that space um

822
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so your first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question was about</font>

823
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:42,689
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fraud in big versus small Amy sure</font>

824
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,729
so I'd say for the most part with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

825
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,500
very large blocks I see a little bit

826
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,060
less fraud especially if it comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

827
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">slight holder because there are pretty</font>

828
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,780
clear records there and the holders a

829
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,310
very large amounts of space tend to be

830
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,220
very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations where you can</font>

831
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,899
do a bit more diligence with I see yeah

832
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,730
I see more frog going on with the

833
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,930
smaller box especially smaller than a /

834
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:06,360
16 um it's yeah I'd say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you</font>

835
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,650
get slashed Bonnie<font color="#E5E5E5"> and small you see you</font>

836
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,649
see quite a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

837
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,240
be careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> about who you're dealing with</font>

838
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:14,250
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you get you know chain of</font>

839
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,080
title history where it's there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

840
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,790
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use escrow in other ways</font>

841
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,590
to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know make sure your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phones don't</font>

842
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:25,740
go over ahead of time and as far the so

843
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:27,720
with the very small sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't use</font>

844
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,130
lawyers or I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a lot of</font>

845
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,900
organizations using lawyers with a

846
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,500
really small sales just because the

847
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,240
dollar amount is so low that is just not

848
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,270
reasonable for them to do so whatever

849
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,190
money they would lose from doing that is

850
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,250
typically less than the cost of

851
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,680
Ernie is being involved in that again

852
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use escrow yeah it's better</font>

853
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,190
tolerance for risk you know no one here

854
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell you what when to use</font>

855
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,310
and what not to use a lawyer that's up

856
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,679
to you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what's your tolerance</font>

857
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:58,950
for risk at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 bucks an IP address it's</font>

858
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,810
over four thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> for / 24 does</font>

859
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,760
that four thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars plus the time</font>

860
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,590
you put in is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that mean a lot to</font>

861
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,110
you if it does then you spend a little

862
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:10,199
bit more and and protect yourself more

863
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:15,270
if it's negligible then you are open to

864
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:18,030
more risk this is in the very small in

865
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the scenario</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've outlined this is</font>

866
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:24,120
where brokers and exchange operators are

867
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,280
very very helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their interest</font>

869
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,879

good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their business this is where</font>

they can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a help but the small</font>

872
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,500
for the small / 24 transfers once you've

873
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,899
agreed on price and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">price you're paying your brokers and</font>

875
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,930
exchange operators have done this

876
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:47,159
they've iterated it over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm feel pretty confident saying</font>

878
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,940
you're probably in good hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've</font>

879
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,440
picked a good broker or exchange turn

880
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,940
our reputations are at stake with these

881
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">two cos we do so many of these it's not</font>

882
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,140
like this is a one-time deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're</font>

883
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,419
in and out so we so we do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a</font>

884
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit of vetting that goes on before we</font>

885
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:05,040
even engage a seller because we would

886
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,360
hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in a situation where we</font>

887
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,710
perpetuated some sort of fraudulent

888
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,940
activity because you know where

889
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:13,409
reputation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is high to what we're doing</font>

890
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,300
here I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement in a question</font>

891
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:17,870
using my own<font color="#CCCCCC"> mic Donny Roizman with</font>

00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">softlayer just two statements I want to</font>

893
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:23,040
echo a bit one step on to echo a bit the

894
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,510
value of brokers or exchange operators

895
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,420
is definitely huge these are experts in

896
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,490
the market many companies maybe would

897
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:32,430
complete one two three transactions over

898
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,439
a multi-year period these exchange

899
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,940
operators and brokers are moving a

900
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,440
multiple per month<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

901
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're really tapping your tapping into</font>

902
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,730
a good resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> their one recommendation</font>

903
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:43,380
I would make is if you are being

904
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,120
solicited by a broker and exchange

905
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,510
operator which you have never bumped

906
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,399
into a tan a nog

907
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:51,280
or an errand or ripe or an AP Nick

908
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,659
delete the email hang up the phone I you

909
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,000
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with people</font>

910
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,830
who are active in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space who know the</font>

911
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,690
business know the industry and know the

912
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,160
players in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> space so I would say your</font>

913
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:02,530
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> bet is look look at one of these</font>

914
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,640
conferences and talk to the broker so

915
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,580
you can actually see in person that

916
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,710
you've seen coming back again and again

917
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:11,020
one question I had is you'd mentioned a

918
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:14,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">van in your slide that there are some</font>

919
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,240
cases where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be speaking to a</font>

920
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,340
seller and they'll say well I have

921
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,600
ninety percent ready now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the rest of</font>

922
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ten percent might be ready in the</font>

923
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,270
future what would be your advice or

924
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,100
recommendation if you find yourself in

925
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,320
that position so I mean it depends on

926
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">your situation if you don't need that</font>

927
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten percent so good it's a good</font>

928
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,980
transaction it's a qualified seller it's

929
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,710
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're comfortable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

930
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,480
business with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> price is right go for</font>

931
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,400
it you you structure the terms and

932
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">conditions of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the contract to ensure</font>

933
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> penalties or there are</font>

934
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,640
motivations for them to follow through

935
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and deliver future tranches as they're</font>

936
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,580
clean you follow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer to engineer</font>

937
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,680
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally act in good faith if</font>

938
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,270
you found a good buyer and if you're a

939
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,290
qualified seller you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

940
00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:01,300
just trying to do business right so it's

941
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,009
increasingly common as far as I can tell

942
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not going to get all the</font>

943
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,540
space right away so you have to be

944
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">flexible and you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be flexible in</font>

945
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,990
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand the</font>

946
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,910
seller is trying to make a sale so you

947
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,259
need to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and put yourself</font>

948
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:18,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">in their shoes and say well what would</font>

949
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:19,540
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and go with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort</font>

950
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,520
of preface that by saying that's very

951
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,110
much true for large sales if you're

952
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,509
looking fine ass flash 16 are smaller

953
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:27,010
and the entity you're working with can't

954
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,900
get off of the space all at once keep

955
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,580
looking there's a ton more space out

956
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,530
there especially if it's less than a 16

957
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:36,940
so that's really just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large pyre</font>

958
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:39,310
problem it's been served from google a

959
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,860
couple of questions first one is is

960
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,960
there any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a reputation system</font>

961
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,480
that would help someone figure out if

962
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:51,850
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a reputable broker</font>

963
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,650
or agent not that I'm aware there's no

964
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,720
gossip sheet somewhere

965
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:58,410
can become a registered facilitator with

966
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,700
the rirs<font color="#E5E5E5"> f transfer policies in place</font>

967
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">although I when we sign up I'm pretty</font>

968
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure we just had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sign a document pay</font>

969
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,140
five hundred dollars i'm not sure it

970
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,529
didn't there wasn't a ton of vetting

971
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:11,589
going on there it's a very young market

972
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:13,930
and the opaqueness sometimes works

973
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:15,490
against us yeah they may be asked for

974
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,930
references and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the types of</font>

975
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,939
organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are giving you</font>

976
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:22,058
references from are they organizations

977
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:24,400
that you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so the second</font>

978
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:28,740
observation is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hear terms like</font>

979
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,869
purchase and asset that makes me nervous

980
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:36,520
now some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you will have watched the</font>

981
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:38,470
IANA transition debates and actions that

982
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,079
were taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> place very close to the</font>

983
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition point an argument was being</font>

984
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,230
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an asset of the government was</font>

985
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:50,279
being transferred this is not helpful I

986
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">gather it's almost impossible to stop</font>

987
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:54,430
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same problem with domain</font>

988
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,020
names people<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak as if they owned them</font>

989
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:59,109
but they really only have a license to

990
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,960
use I noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were careful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

991
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:05,460
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron refers to license there</font>

992
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:08,559
are good reasons for that to protect the

993
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,510
whole system but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gather that our</font>

994
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,329
friends outside the US don't have the

995
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:17,099
same litigious concerns that we do yeah

996
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:20,349
I'll share something with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience I</font>

997
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:24,940
john curran the CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> of aaron has been</font>

998
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:27,069
very loud and upfront over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year</font>

999
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,990
and a half that IP addresses are not an

1000
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:30,799
asset as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron is concerned they</font>

1001
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:34,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a license</font>

1002
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:39,439
and this didn't sit all that well with

1003
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:42,469
me so<font color="#CCCCCC"> mm the company I work for is</font>

1004
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:45,558
spending a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1005
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:48,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure we got it right so we invested</font>

1006
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,719
some money in some time then a lot of

1007
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:53,779
lawyers to do months of research and

1008
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:57,949
really look at this and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United</font>

1009
00:38:53,779 --> 00:39:00,529
States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and under US law we came to the</font>

1010
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:02,539
conclusion that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron's position that</font>

1011
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:04,759
Vince is expressed very well is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1012
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:06,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred percent backed up by the law</font>

1013
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,749
these are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yours these are not assets</font>

1014
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:10,669
and that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to be really</font>

1015
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:12,709
careful in that first paragraph of that

1016
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:16,219
contract that asset purchase agreement

1017
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:18,198
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yours you're gonna use it</font>

1018
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:19,789
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to think about it like</font>

1019
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,229
yours because we're you know they're on

1020
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:23,569
a network and hopefully they're going to

1021
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:29,390
be there for decades but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not an</font>

1022
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:33,049
asset then vintage saying software is

1023
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:34,249
starting to turn into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well just</font>

1024
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:35,959
a minor language point there's a

1025
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,368
difference between an asset<font color="#CCCCCC"> and property</font>

1026
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,689
so you can have a contract right that is

1027
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:39,979
an asset but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you own it</font>

1028
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:41,299
like property but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

1029
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:43,669
we're getting at here is the property

1030
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:46,429
question yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in North America they</font>

1031
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,630
treat<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a contract right but there</font>

1032
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:49,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">are all sorts of contract rights that</font>

1033
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,509
you can buy and sell that doesn't make

1034
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">it your property it just means you're</font>

1035
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:54,769
assuming somebody else's position within

1036
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:58,910
that contract but it's still you know an

1037
00:39:54,769 --> 00:40:00,529
asset of your organization Kevin Kevin

1038
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,629
Bloomberg so thankful even brought up

1039
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">the regulation and of the brook get of</font>

1040
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:09,799
brokers where there really isn't any and

1041
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:12,769
just to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the concern I have seen</font>

1042
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:15,259
brokers at multiple conferences<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

1043
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:17,520
and nanog and Barnum & Bailey would be

1044
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:19,720
proud

1045
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,670
just because you've seen them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1046
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:26,140
halls the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're selling is</font>

1047
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,990
ridiculous so what I'd actually like to

1048
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:34,029
ask each one of you is can you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1049
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:36,069
point out the best not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even fraudulence</font>

1050
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:39,510
the wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> word the biggest exaggeration</font>

1051
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:42,610
the biggest crap you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen from</font>

1052
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,410
pseudo brokers in our industry something

1053
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,090
that really stood out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'll</font>

1054
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually start with you my favorite was</font>

1055
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:53,830
the broker who tested his<font color="#CCCCCC"> sellers space</font>

1056
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,510
and in doing so got it listed on every

1057
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:58,930
blacklist out there and made it

1058
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:01,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">unsalable that stupidity not malicious</font>

1059
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:05,859
but stupidity so do you have any good

1060
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:08,200
stories in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> regard um I I recently</font>

1061
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,580
had a fun fraud face I'm helping

1062
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,770
somebody get some space back that was

1063
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,360
Friday lately taken from them there is

1064
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">another broker I'm still working out the</font>

1065
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,480

1066
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,790
blame or name any names but it looks

1067
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,210
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a broker that was involved</font>

1068
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:23,470
with submitting some fraudulent

1069
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,700
documentation that included a notarized

1070
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:33,700
signature from somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had been</font>

1071
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:37,210
dead<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years yeah yeah the stories</font>

1072
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:40,710
I could tell I spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years of Aaron</font>

1073
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,710
fighting fraud I've seen a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

1074
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:53,560
when I had a broker this week offer a

1075
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:57,609
tranche of a / 12 to me for fifteen

1076
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,560
dollars an IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1077
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:02,830
an opening number it's fine it's not

1078
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:06,160
that irregular today and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> said but I</font>

1079
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:09,520
have a different seller who has 40

1080
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,730
different blocks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> together comprise</font>

1081
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,119
almost a / 12 and he's willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell</font>

1082
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:19,019
them to you for nine dollars

1083
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,630
gosh why do you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why when a</font>

1084
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:23,729
broker comes to you and has to what they

1085
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,890
think of as equivalent block sizes and

1086
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,710
two completely different prices one of

1087
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,420
which is completely below market you got

1088
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,269
to ask yourself why and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font>

1089
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,680
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that email from the broker and</font>

1090
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:37,589
he and I known each other a long time so

1091
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,990
he mails fine I said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow this</font>

1092
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:41,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy doesn't get it God doesn't realize</font>

1093
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:44,118
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1094
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:47,730
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just scamming for box</font>

1095
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,019
you're not helping<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody hello one</font>

1096
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,190
thing I'll say in defense of brokers

1097
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:51,990
that will give you two different prices

1098
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,789
sometimes we do have clients that have

1099
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,629
different timing requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1100
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">special if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with like a</font>

1101
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,079
bankruptcy estate or something where

1102
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,240
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited time period where they</font>

1103
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,410
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get those funds and sometimes</font>

1104
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,209
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can provide you with a credible</font>

1105
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,499
back story of why one seller might be

1106
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,420
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell for below market value</font>

1107
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,919
it's probably upfront about yeah yeah

1108
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,200
they should tell you about that right

1109
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,999
and if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask about it make sure</font>

1110
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,069
