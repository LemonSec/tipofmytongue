you need to know before you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go you know</font>

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company and you</font>

45
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,340
have to secure your capex and the capex

46
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,689
is not only your purchase price but it's

47
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,479
two things you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to know</font>

48
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:07,389
which are your transaction fees with the

49
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,179
registry with escrow agents which costs

50
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:14,170
money and fees that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be paying to</font>

51
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:16,090
a broker or to an exchange and after you

52
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,250
get your capex the most important part

53
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,880
of this whole process is if you've got

54
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,590
to find em na lawyers this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

59
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,760
when you say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need counsel for buying</font>

60
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,280
IP addresses they don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,799
is and what you tell them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its M&A</font>

62
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,360
activity you're making an acquisition of

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,630
somebody else's intellectual property

64
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,160
purchase price seems to matter a lot but

65
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually one of the least important</font>

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,989
parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the deal the terms and</font>

67
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,420
conditions the covenants the

68
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,459
representations the warranties are the

69
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,470
most important part when you're a buyer

70
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,270
you need to purchase an asset and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

71
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,330
need to protect your company while

72
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,890
you're doing this and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

73
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,340
costs money you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

74
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:13,899
significant operating capital to pay for

75
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:16,209
these M&A lawyers as Amy said just keep

76
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,160
in mind what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in the rirs you</font>

cannot buy space and lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> nique or</font>

83
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,910
some of us do that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to add</font>

84
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,329
complexity into the terms and conditions

85
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,820
of your contract have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> RA our</font>

account ready to receive the addresses

87
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,410
Amy talked about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll move on the</font>

88
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,209
regulatory framework and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason I</font>

89
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,790
put this in here is the very first

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,010
paragraph of an asset purchase agreement

91
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,500
the lawyer needs to know what words to

92
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,750
use what is it you're buying well if

93
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,970
you're buying IP addresses in Aaron land

94
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,480
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not buying an asset you're buying</font>

96
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,859
in right you're pretty much buying an

asset as far as that<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal regime is</font>

let you know transactions are not closed

small companies I mean that's where most

334
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,260
of the market is right mostly market is

in the buying and selling of /

as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can see sure so I handle a ton of</font>

354
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:07,160
really small sales I run an auction

platform specifically aimed at small

356
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,469
buyers and small sellers where we

357
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,850
automate the contract process to get a

358
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,500
lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurdles that the big guys</font>

359
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,090
have to deal with and all of the lawyers

360
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,500
out of the way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these smaller deals</font>

361
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,070
and they still have to go through the

362
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,420
Aaron transfer process and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

363
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more difficult for them sometimes</font>

364
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they tend not to have as much</font>

365
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,640
experience as the operators handling the

366
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,590
larger companies they haven't gone

367
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,330
through the process of getting face

368
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,360
directly from Aaron so sometimes that's

369
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,520
an extra hurdle for them to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

370
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,990
with but they can still participate in

371
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,460
the policy development process like

372
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,900
anybody else can you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate on</font>

373
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,610
the pp ml you can come to the meetings

374
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,439
and talk if you have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

375
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,470
policies and how they're applying your

376
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,480
organization so I don't see there being

377
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,710
a huge difference between me between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

the wire

384
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,449
question for you first two quick things

385
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,730
first one is the aaron who was service

386
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,890
it wasn't really mentioned there have

387

either of you use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> service as a way</font>

388
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:20,500
of looking back at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 25 years of</font>

389
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,270
history related to blocks is that within

390
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,580
the terms things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because it</font>

391
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,949
was a little ambiguous to me if as part

392
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a transfer a buyer could look at the</font>

393
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,520
who was data if that's allowed in the

394
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,089
terms and if you've used it in the past

395
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,949
i really be curious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so i</font>

396
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:38,140
don't believe it's technically allowed

under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i've seen who was used</font>

that purpose as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure you'll</font>

402
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,430
probably better in that vein<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to</font>

goes and Ras goes back like you know

409

decades it's wonderful who was as you're

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,330
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you weren't allowed to</font>

426
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,649
transfer for three years but there's no

427
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to necessarily know that without</font>

428
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,780
really digging into it yeah and that and

429
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,010
that's as buyers as engineers as

430
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,920
operators we can't be expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:59,110
every little detail about<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our IRS</font>

432
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,610
rules in every blocks history and that's

433
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,320
where as Amy was saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

434
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,330
presentation it's all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> protecting</font>

435
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,950
yourself in the terms and conditions can

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,679
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your money back if something</font>

437
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,740
went wrong

438
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,110
I jean-christophe at DePaul University

439
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,520
two brief questions he<font color="#CCCCCC"> can choose who</font>

440
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,350
wants to answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the first you</font>

441
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,330
mentioned thirty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> fraud no</font>

442
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,080
wondering if there's any<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional</font>

443
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:24,540
pattern to that like should I be more

444
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,240
leery of fraud occurring with a / 16

445
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,889
versus a / 24 or not or or does it not

446
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,830
really necessarily matter second

447
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is if I'm from a one-man shop</font>

448
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,850
but I've got a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for just maybe a</font>

449
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,470
couple of / 24 zits few hundred bucks it

450
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,179
just based on my quick judgment of what

451
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,360
it might cost me at least just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

452
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">address space lawyers that sounds really</font>

453
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,110
expensive for just those two small

454
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,730
relatively assets you still recommend

455
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,399
going through an elaborate lawyer

456
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,950
process or how involved do i need to get

457
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,540
legal rep not a lawyer but how what

458
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,690
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i expect for legal</font>

459
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,020
representation even for relatively small

460
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,870
purchase purchases in that space um

461
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:07,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so your first question was about</font>

462
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:09,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fraud in big versus small Amy sure</font>

463
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,730
so I'd say for the most part with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

464
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,469
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocks I see a little bit less</font>

465
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,820
fraud especially if it comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font>

466
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,070
date holder because there are pretty

467
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,540
clear records there and the holders a

468
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,070
very large amounts of space tend to be

469
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,250
very large organizations where you can

470
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,260
do a bit more diligence with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see</font>

471
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,700
more frog going on with the smaller box

472
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,110
especially smaller than a / 16 um it's

473
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,510
yeah I'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this once you get slashed</font>

474
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lonnie and small you see you see quite a</font>

475
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,440
bit more so you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be careful</font>

476
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">about who you're dealing with make sure</font>

477
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you get you know chain of title</font>

478
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,409
history where it's there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make</font>

479
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,110
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> escrow in other ways to you</font>

480
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">know make sure your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phones don't go over</font>

481
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:52,500
a ahead of time and as far the so with

482
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,450
the very small sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't use</font>

483
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,860
lawyers which I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

484
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,660
of organizations using lawyers with a

485
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,139
really small tells just because the

486
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,700
dollar amount is so low that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

487
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,730
not reasonable for them to do so

488
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,930
whatever money they would lose from

489
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,029
doing that is typically less than the

490
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,179
cost of

491
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:13,879
he's being involved in that again just

492
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:15,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">use escrow yeah it's better tolerance</font>

493
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,238
for risk you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one here is going</font>

494
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,830
to tell you what when to use and what

495
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:21,289
not to use a lawyer that's up to you but

496
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's what your tolerance for risk at 15</font>

497
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:25,700
bucks an IP address it's over four

498
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,590
thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his last 24 does</font>

499
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,509
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> four thousand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars plus the time</font>

500
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,369
you put in is that is that mean a lot to

501
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:33,859
you if it does then you spend a little

502
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:36,949
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and protect yourself more</font>

503
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:42,439
if it's negligible then you are open to

504
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:44,960
more risk this in the very small in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

505
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,529
scenario you've outlined this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

506
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,960
brokers and exchange operators are very

507
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:53,029
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful because their interest is</font>

508
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,830
in just<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving right volume and they</font>

509
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:56,629
want a successful market because it's

510
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,728
good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their business this is where</font>

511
00:20:56,629 --> 00:21:02,809
they can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a help but the small</font>

512
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:04,249
for the small / 24 transfers once you've

513
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:06,649
agreed on price and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with the</font>

514
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:07,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">price you're paying your brokers and</font>

515
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:09,678
exchange operators have done this

516
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,908
they've iterated it over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and</font>

517
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm feel pretty confident saying</font>

518
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,690
you're probably in good<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands if you've</font>

519
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,099
picked a good broker or exchange sure

520
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and our reputations are at stake with</font>

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two cos we do so many of these</font>

522
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:24,199
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this is a one-time deal where</font>

523
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,849
we're in and out so we so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

524
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,989
quite a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vetting that goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

525
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:31,460
before we even engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> a seller because</font>

526
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:33,139
we would hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in a situation where</font>

527
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">we perpetuate some sort of fraudulent</font>

528
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:35,689
activity because you know where

529
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:40,190
reputation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is high to what we're doing</font>

530
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:42,049
here I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement in a question</font>

531
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,619
using my own<font color="#CCCCCC"> mic Donnie roizman with</font>

532
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">softlayer just two statements I want to</font>

533
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:49,339
echo a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> once they've on Deko a bit</font>

534
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:50,809
the value of brokers or exchange

535
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:52,428
operators is definitely huge these are

536
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,428
experts in the market many companies

537
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:57,159
maybe would complete one two three

538
00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,320
transactions over a multi-year period

539
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,419
these exchange operators and brokers are

540
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,769
moving a multiple per month<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're</font>

541
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">there they're really tapping your</font>

542
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:07,940
tapping into a good resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> their one</font>

543
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,859
recommendation I would make is if you

544
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,599
are being solicited by a broker and

545
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:13,290
exchange operator which you have never

546
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,149
bumped into a tan a nog

547
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,030
or an errand or ripe or an AP Nick

548
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,440
delete the email hang up the phone I you

549
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,750
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with people</font>

550
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,580
who are active in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space who know the</font>

551
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,440
business know the industry and know the

552
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,909
players in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> space i would say your</font>

553
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,280
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> bet is look look at one of these</font>

554
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,390
conferences and talk to the broker so

555
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,330
you can actually see in person that

556
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:35,400
you've seen coming back again and again

557
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:37,770
one question I had is you'd mentioned

558
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">even in your slide that there are some</font>

559
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:43,020
cases where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be speaking to a</font>

560
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,120
seller and they'll say well I have

561
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,350
ninety percent ready now and the rest of

562
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ten percent might be ready in the</font>

563
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,050
future what would be your advice or

564
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,879
recommendation if you find yourself in

565
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,070
that position so I mean it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

566
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,800
your situation if you don't need that

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,230
and deliver future tranches as they're

580
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,050
just trying to do business right so it's

581
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,760
increasingly common as far as I can tell

582
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,610
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not going to get all the</font>

583
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,320
space right away so you have to be

584
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">flexible and you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be flexible in</font>

586
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,660
seller is trying to make a sale so you

587
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,010
need to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and put yourself</font>

588
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:45,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">in their shoes and say well what would</font>

589
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:46,440
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and go with it I would just sort</font>

590
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,540
of preface off I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very much</font>

591
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,450
true for large sales if you're looking

592
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,860
fine a / 16 are smaller and the entity

593
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,480
you're working with can't get off of the

594
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,340
space all at once keep looking there's a

595
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,230
ton more space out there especially if

596
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,709
it's less than a 16 so that's really

597
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:04,650
just that's a large pyre problem it's

598
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,050
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> surf from google a couple of</font>

599
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,660
questions first one is is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind</font>

600
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a reputation system that would help</font>

601
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:16,980
someone figure out if they are speaking

602
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:20,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a reputable broker or agent not that</font>

603
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,240
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware there's no gossip sheets over</font>

604
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,970
you can become a registered facilitator

605
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,370
with the rirs<font color="#E5E5E5"> f transfer policies in</font>

607

609
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,520
not sure it didn't there wasn't a ton of

610
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:37,110
vetting going on there yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's</font>

611
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,120
a very young market and the opaqueness

612
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:42,040
sometimes works against us yeah so maybe

613
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,689
ask for references and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the types</font>

614
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,700
of organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are giving you</font>

615
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,790
references from are they organizations

616
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,160
that you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so the second</font>

617
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:55,830
observation is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hear terms like</font>

618
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:59,020
purchase and asset that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes me nervous</font>

619
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:03,790
some of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have watched the iono</font>

620
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:05,230
transition debates and actions that were

621
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,840
taking place very close to the

622
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition point an argument was being</font>

623
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,990
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an asset of the government was</font>

624
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,040
being transferred this is not helpful I

625
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:19,300
gather it's almost impossible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

626
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,190
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same problem with domain</font>

627
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,780
names people<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak as if they owned them</font>

628
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,870
but they really only have a license to

629
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,720
use I noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were careful to</font>

630
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,219
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin refers to license there</font>

631
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,320
are good reasons for that to protect the

632
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,270
whole system but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gather that our</font>

633
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,250
friends outside the US don't have the

634
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,250
same litigious concern is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

635
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:46,390
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll share something with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

636
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:51,280
audience I john curran the CEO of<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin</font>

637
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:53,410
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very loud and upfront over the</font>

638
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,120
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and a half that IP addresses</font>

639
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,580
are not an asset as far as Erin is

640
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,360
concerned they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a license</font>

641
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:06,189
and this didn't sit all that well with

642
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:09,250
me so mmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company I work for is</font>

643
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:12,310
spending a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

644
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:15,040
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it right so we invested</font>

645
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:17,470
some money in some time then a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

646
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,560
lawyers to do months of research and

647
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:24,700
really look at this and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United</font>

648
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,280
States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and under US law we came to the</font>

649
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,290
conclusion that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron's position that</font>

650
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,510
Vince is expressed very well as one

651
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,430
hundred percent backed up by the law

652
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,500
these are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yours these are not assets</font>

653
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's where you got to be really</font>

654
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,460
careful in that first paragraph of that

655
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,970
contract that asset purchase agreement

656
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,950
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yours you're gonna use it</font>

657
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,540
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to think about it like</font>

658
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,980
yours because we're you know they're on

659
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,320
a network and hopefully they're going to

660
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:56,140
be there for decades<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not an</font>

661
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:59,800
asset then vintage saying software is

662
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,000
starting to turn into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well just</font>

663
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,710
a minor<font color="#E5E5E5"> language point there's a</font>

664
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,120
difference between an asset<font color="#CCCCCC"> and property</font>

665
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,470
so you can have a contract right that is

666
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,729
an asset but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you own it</font>

667
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,050
like property but I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

668
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,420
we're getting at here is the property

669
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:13,180
question yeah and in North America they

670
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,380
treat it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a contract right but there</font>

671
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">are all sorts of contract rights that</font>

672
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,260
you can buy and sell that doesn't make

673
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">it your property it just means you're</font>

674
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,520
assuming somebody else's position within

675
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:25,660
that contract but it's still you know an

676
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,400
asset of your organization Kevin Kevin

677
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,410
Bloomberg so thankful even brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

678
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,260
the regulation and of the brook get<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

679
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:36,550
brokers where there really isn't any and

680
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:39,520
just to add to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concern I have seen</font>

681
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:42,040
brokers at multiple conferences<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

682
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,269
and nanog and Barnum & Bailey would be

683
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,470
proud

684
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:50,419
just because you've seen them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

685
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:52,890
halls the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're selling is</font>

686
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:55,740
ridiculous so what I'd actually like to

687
00:27:52,890 --> 00:28:00,779
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you is can you sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

688
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,820
point out the best not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fraudulence</font>

689
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:06,260
the wrong word the biggest exaggeration

690
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,360
the biggest crap you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen from</font>

691
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,580
pseudo brokers in our industry something

692
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,870
that really stood out and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

693
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,610
start with you my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite was the</font>

694
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:20,580
broker who tested his sellers space and

695
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:22,260
in doing so got it listed on every

696
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,678
blacklist out there and made it

697
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:27,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">unsalable that stupidity not malicious</font>

698
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:32,639
but stupidity so do you have any good

699
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:34,950
stories in that regard um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recently</font>

700
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:36,330
had a fun fraud case I'm helping

701
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,549
somebody get some space back that was

702
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,110
Friday lately taken from them there is

703
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">another broker I'm still working out the</font>

704
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,229
details i'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assign any</font>

705
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:45,570
blame or name any names but it looks

706
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">like there is a broker that was involved</font>

707
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,220
with submitting some fraudulent

723
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:49,249
why when a broker comes to you and has

724
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:51,918
to what they think of as equivalent

725
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:53,779
block sizes and two completely different

726
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,659
prices one of which is completely below

727
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:59,359

that will give you two different prices

737
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,539
sometimes we do have clients that have

738
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:21,379
different timing requirements or

739
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:23,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">suchlike</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're with me look like a</font>

747
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:36,950
