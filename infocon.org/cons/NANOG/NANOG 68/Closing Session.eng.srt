find is that what you find on the link

48
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,370
for registered voters is a little

49
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,200
different than what we're going to

50
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,209
report here today and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we</font>

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,048
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of folks who register for the</font>

52
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:40,340
meeting but they didn't show up so we

53
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:43,700
have a total of 162 folks on site we

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,160

up this time we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine students who</font>

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,730
registered and paid their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars to</font>

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,670
attend we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 speakers this meeting</font>

58
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,100
and I'm pleased to report that we had 24

59
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">college immersion students here and</font>

62
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,280
it's up a little bit but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

63
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,799
much about the same thing the important

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,390
point for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is well is the number of</font>

65
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,319
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I find in the</font>

66
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,630
hallways<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntt juniper and softlayer led</font>

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,608
the way this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> is compared to chicago</font>

68
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:29,480
it was just MTT and juniper ah we go

69
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:31,370
back the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> important element that</font>

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> share with folks is the</font>

71
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,040
number of countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had here</font>

72
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:42,100
with us in Dallas we had 33 countries

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,540
here and in Chicago we had I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> 28</font>

74
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,799
here's a little bit it's hard to read

75
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,370
I'm sorry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

76
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,650
bit better visual in terms of the

77
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,140
projectors but it's a breakdown of the

78
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,440
various air

79
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,170
areas of demographic representation

80
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,260
throughout the hallway I think you'll

81
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,510
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's kind of hard to say but</font>

82
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet service provider category</font>

between the nanog events that you'll see

159
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,079
in programming<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andy on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the road</font>

160

Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Betty so just just that I</font>

161
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,900
think folks have heard a fair amount

162
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the road but it is an</font>

163
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,260
outreach effort it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a one-day</font>

164
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,260
conference instead of the three-day

165
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,010
conference as of<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now we do not</font>

166
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:00,830
charge for attending nanog on the road

167
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:03,860
and in in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases it's the nanog</font>

168
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,650
members of the in the nanog organization

169
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,620
that that is funding those the program

170
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,900
committee is responsible for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

171
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,310
content and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the production of those just</font>

172
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the main meeting so there's no</font>

173
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,380
difference we bring similar content

174
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,900
similar speakers<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

175
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,710
may have been presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a knock</font>

176
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,390
oftentimes local speakers and we do get

177
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,849
keynotes and new material that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

178
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,500
present<font color="#E5E5E5"> there if you're interested in in</font>

179
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,710
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at any of the dates feel free</font>

180
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,520
to reach out to the program committee

181
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,169
but the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is</font>

182
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,370
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do mention it on the mailing</font>

183
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:43,030
lists and social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

184
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,770
attendees hear about it by word of mouth

185
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:50,600
so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an Operations team</font>

186
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:52,130
service delivery friends students<font color="#E5E5E5"> I any</font>

187
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,020
contacts in any of the city's we're

188
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,540
going to I mention it to them there's

189
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,980
there's no risk to them they get not

190
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,199
only the chance to attend the meeting

191
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,210
but also social networking<font color="#CCCCCC"> event at the</font>

192
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">end where they get to meet local</font>

193
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,490
operators and other people just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

194
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,630
they do at nanog so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's good</font>

195
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough we want to get to you on to a</font>

social<font color="#CCCCCC"> event so we'll keep going all</font>

197
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">right survey comments I know we're done</font>

203
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:34,880
production the on-site staff has worked

204
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">very hard on the power the Wi-Fi and the</font>

205
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:42,140
sound so we've we've learned some things

206
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,310
and will improve with that we also want

207
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,590

208
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,020
thought about the speakers the mix of

209
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,390
content if there's anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think we</font>

219
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:19,100
registration and the call for

220
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:23,719
presentations ah for presenters at Nanak

222
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,379
announcements one other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might</font>

223
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,799
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh is issued this warning we expect</font>

224
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:36,379
strong attendance in February so look at

225
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,269
the website and follow the link as soon

226
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:42,290
as possible and make your hotel

227
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:43,610
reservation<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

228
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,738
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the conference</font>

229
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,529
something that Nana Does do slightly

230
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:50,779
differently with the presentations is

231
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,360
when you submit something we assign a

232
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:55,100
shepherd so if you have an idea you've

233
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,980
done some initial work on it you have a

234
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,920
just an abstract but you're interested

235
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">in presenting I respond to that call for</font>

236
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,118
presentations get it in the tool will

237
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:07,399
have a PC member get in touch with you

238
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:09,259
and there are cases where we've had

239
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,240
folks who had an idea didn't have a

240
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:14,029
presentation we worked with them and

241
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,429
they were on the program at this nanog

242
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,189
and we'd like to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen in the</font>

243
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:22,850
future so you're an operator you're a
