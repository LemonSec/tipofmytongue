00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,429
I have been on a number of boards

43
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,200
not-for-profit boards related to the

industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm currently on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Toric's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i was involved in scenic as part of the</font>

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,430
the budgeting of a conference of about

51
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,690
350 attendees smaller than an odd but

52
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,019
many of the similar issues that an

53
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,690
organization like nanog has at the end

54
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,940
of the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> i understand that there's a</font>

55
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,769
difference between being a member of an

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,560
organization and being on a board of an

57
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,930
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ideas</font>

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,830
but i also have a very open mind towards

59
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,049
where I knowing that the board has a lot

60
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,600
of decisions that they have to make

61
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:53,010
while they're very transparent there's a

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a board cannot</font>

63
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,560
necessarily talk about through<font color="#E5E5E5"> nba's etc</font>

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,380
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to go in</font>

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,560
with my<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes wide open I'm from Canada</font>

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,640
so I'm the north in North American

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,920
network operators and I believe that

68
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,260
having somebody who comes from a smaller

69
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,690
background of internet provider as well

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,328
as having<font color="#E5E5E5"> board experience that is</font>

71
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,940
similar in nature to nanog idea by a

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions that were asked when I ran</font>

85
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:03,079
last time were centered around topics

86
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,370
like diversity in the industry and I

87
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,860
think we've done some things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

88
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,620
those things those concerns we've

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,960
implemented you know it we've grown the

scholarship program that I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

96
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:27,920
Jezebel Gilmore and Betty Burke on the

97
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,590
idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide an actual scholarship</font>

98
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,750
for four to eight candidates every year

99
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,280
that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to bring some additional</font>

100
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,380
people into the industry some of the

101
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,659
best and brightest also aimed at

102
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,360
minorities I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to again increase</font>

103
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,990
diversity within the organization as

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,560
Kevin said you know as a not-for-profit

105
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,960
our goal is to educate our members and

106
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people that come to our to our</font>

107
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,849
meetings and I think we've done a good

108
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,380
job of doing that expanding our base if

109
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,210
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at attendance for these</font>

110
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,950
meetings they've never been bigger I've

111
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,419
heard some people argue that that's not

112
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good thing necessarily but I would</font>

113
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,370
argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good thing and so yeah I just</font>

114
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to continue the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good work and</font>

115
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,430
hopefully serve out a final term on the

116
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,020
board so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asking for your vote all</font>

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,950
the candidates are great so I don't

118
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're going to go wrong</font>

of expanding greatly what we've dealt

with data centers peering software and I

132

<font color="#CCCCCC">only growing attendance but expanding</font>

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,440
expanding upon I'd like to continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

145
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,480
see some of the stuff we've done like

146
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,450
Nana on the road a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that</font>

147
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,630
were doing with education and outreach

148
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,010
getting to folks who don't necessarily

149
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,450
even know of us much less feel

150
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,670
comfortable interacting with our

151
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:41,300
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and let them know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

152
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:45,080
is indeed a warm open inclusive society

153
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,420
and that education is really i think the

154
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,190
core of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing as far as</font>

155
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,020
experiences i said i've done program

156
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,540
committee and development committee I've

157
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,240

162
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:08,060

163
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,070
bring a fair amount of experience in and

network operations and how we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

205
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,780
in especially the newer members I think

206
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,280
the current board has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing a</font>

207
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,790
pretty good job about lots and lots of

208
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">things I just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help out with that</font>

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,100
mortar companies so I have a nice wide

215
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,100
experience at that level as well but

216
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,710
mostly I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that my experience</font>

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,860
as a college junior which was nineteen

230
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,710

239
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,130
at this nanog as part of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

like forty two percent for this event do

267
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,830
not have a SNS associated with it and

268
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,540
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just laziness where</font>

towards the operations and education in

that community that may be drifting away

286
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,230
gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of hardball</font>

287
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:01,279
because obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be on</font>

288

289
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,450
historically are the folks who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done</font>

290
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">best on the nanog board of directors are</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have had a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of financial</font>

292
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,610
or management experience because this is

293
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,709
run into a big organization with a big

294
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,529
budget there are employees there are HR

295
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,570
issues and this is not an election for

296
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:22,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best network engineer I needless to</font>

297
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:24,029
say so can each candidate described

298
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,459
which executive or senior management

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,620
roles you've held was your operating

reports did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have and just remind her</font>

302
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,790
it's one minute per candidate yeah and

303
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:40,620
Max given me so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the years I've done</font>

304
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:44,490
a number of different things back during

305
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm I was what was my title chief</font>

307
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,020
for 12 people at the time and our budget

308
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,900
that year was nineteen million dollars I

309
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,870
work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small isp today it's my own</font>

310
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,390
is d so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm responsible for all of the</font>

311
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,440
finances<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the CTO of that organization</font>

312
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,660
but more importantly I was the treasurer

313
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,880
of scenic like I said for<font color="#E5E5E5"> six years I</font>

314
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,890
was responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for audited financials</font>

315
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,589
during that<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the budget</font>

316
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,260
of that organization while private was

317
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,540
fairly significant in line with with

318
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:24,779
nanog so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have gone through the whole</font>

319
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:25,730
pace of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that okay will sure over my</font>

320
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:30,650
career I

321
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:35,130
had titles from network engineer to CEO

322
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:37,949
I've managed teams as many as 200 to as

323
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:42,030
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> as two will could you speak up a</font>

324
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:44,460
little bit sure sorry is that better so

325
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,380
yeah over my career I've had a number of

326
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,390
roles I've managed large teams as many

327
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,330
as 200 people reporting either directly

328
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,220
or indirectly into me or you know as

329
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,370
little as a couple of people as my

330
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,650
career's progressed I've had budgets in

331
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,470
the range of a couple of million a year

332
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:04,680
to a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hundred million a year</font>

333
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,300
and yeah I've got a lot of I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

334
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,699
executive experience and managerial

335
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:12,030
experience but I started in the trenches

336
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,830
like many of you and just kind of grew

337
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:17,250
out of the technical role in more into

338
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:19,170
the option of a management role so I've

339
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,620
served on several boards both private

340
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:25,079
and not-for-profit I've helped raise

341
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:30,150
millions of dollars in capital and so I

342
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:32,790
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have that experience so I have</font>

343
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,920
done less direct managerial experience I

344
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:38,219
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> run teams of up to a couple</font>

345
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">dozen but I have been intimately</font>

346
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,330
involved with a number of startup

347
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,910
companies over about 25 years stretch

348
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:47,280
where we did everything including

349
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:50,640
dealing with venture money bank

350
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,130
financing insurance HR all of those

351
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,600
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> things most of them were smaller</font>

352
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,310
companies so they were in the range of

353
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,180
the probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to ten million dollar</font>

354
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:02,540
range I am currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

355
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,180

356
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">single digit millions but we have just</font>

357
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:11,780
gone through<font color="#CCCCCC"> staff financing salaries</font>

358
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,209
fees for conferences and all the rest of

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,819
it little smaller organization but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

360
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:26,900
think fairly relevant in balancing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

361
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:28,550
culture versus money so sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

362
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,470
sea level position now I obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

363
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,599
had teams that range fortunately I've

364
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,160
never fortunately or unfortunately I'm

365
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
not sure how to say it I've never had to

366
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,880
manage hundreds of people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a time but</font>

367
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,590
many dozens of people either directly or

368
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,360
indirectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the most i've ever</font>

369
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,800
had directly reporting to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 13</font>

370
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,370
which by the way i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is too many do</font>

371
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,319
not get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been responsible</font>

372
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,400
for budgets<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking as</font>

373
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
they come down here i'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

374
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,319
the budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the akamai network section</font>

375
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,120
is public and plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wasn't the only one</font>

376
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,220
responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but my current</font>

377
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,850
budget is measured in the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know high</font>

378
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,930
single-digit millions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm on the I'm on</font>

379
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,260
the board of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> London internet</font>

380
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,969
exchange which is approximately I'm

381
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,439
trying to do the math from pounds to

382
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,670
dollars but it's approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

383
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">million dollars a year something in that</font>

384
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,020
range so about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comparable sized call</font>

385
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,570
it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know order of magnitude</font>

386
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,800
comparable sized organization I believe

387
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I have good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> managerial experience</font>

388
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,329
both with people and I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with HR</font>

389
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:28,850
with finance with lawyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all the</font>

390
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:33,350
rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> i currently manage teams six people</font>

391
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:35,330
on three continents as Patrick I can't

392
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,630
really disclose the netflix

393
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:42,980
interconnection budgets 60 data centers

394
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:46,310
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 to 60 IXPs globally so the</font>

395
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,990
substantial chunk of money involved gpf

396
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,060
is still a budget under a million

397
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:54,800
dollars we'll see where that gets to as

398
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:58,910
we may do events over time great thank

399
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,699
you next question what does diversity at

400
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,099
nana mean to you do you feel nanog<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

401
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,900
diversity problem and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> so how would</font>

402
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:10,329
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

403
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:13,450
we'll start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with mr. charnock sure just</font>

404
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:17,379
my mic a little so diversity to me means

405
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:21,310
a broad audience of people from all

406
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:25,360
backgrounds and genders and races and

407
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:28,119
whatnot I think we do have a diversity

408
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,010
problem in our industry I became a

409
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,620
father to a young girl a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

410
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,860
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things I've kind of</font>

411
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,050
adapted my<font color="#E5E5E5"> world you too is that you</font>

412
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,490
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very male-dominated</font>

413
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,870
industry and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we can do</font>

414
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,000
to change that it's not something that's

415
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change overnight but it's</font>

416
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,410
something that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put changes in now</font>

417
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,920
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect the next generation and I</font>

418
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:53,770
believe that's important so yeah I do

419
00:17:50,920 --> 00:18:02,160
think that there's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

420
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:07,270
industry oh sure to me diversity is

421
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,950
social cultural and technical and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

422
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to see us be able to expand all of</font>

423
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,980
those we probably should classes a

424
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,530
diversity problem i hate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that</font>

425
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,350
word but it is we do definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

426
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,510
lack of diversity<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all of those</font>

427
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:26,260
compared to what we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that's</font>

428
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:27,760
certainly a goal to get word range of

429
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,750

430

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,190
do what I forget what I would do I think

00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reaching out to</font>

further to talk to other folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:07,529
what does diversity mean diversity means

445
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,210
a nice wide range of the cross-section

446
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:11,190
of society it's not that hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">out anybody who didn't recognize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

448
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:19,349
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of female participants</font>

449
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:21,269
is confused the thing is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

450
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:23,249
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be forcing people to come to</font>

451
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:24,779
nanog my problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I honestly believe</font>

452
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:26,460
that the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the people out</font>

453
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,989
there don't either know what exists or

454
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,359
they're afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join I mean let's face</font>

455
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:33,779
it this looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an old boys club</font>

456
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:35,939
there's five white guys up here no women

457
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,259
no minority is nothing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

459
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,529
everybody feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome to come in so</font>

460
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,249
reach out to organizations like girls

461
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:46,229
who code net the net girls sort of sub

462
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:48,149
clique of nanog is a good start but we

463
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:51,179
need to reach to organizations outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

464
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:54,059
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of internships and co-ops at my</font>

wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> range of people both religions and</font>

467
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:03,539

468
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,219
those organizations that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

469
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,460
that are not normal and getting them to

470
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:11,820
come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> ugh would be a great thing</font>

471
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:13,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin yeah i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's also this</font>

472
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,809
concern around diversity of thought

473
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:18,450
right is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one big echo chamber do we</font>

474
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,369
all just feed off of ourselves Patrick

475
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,989
stole my my look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stage view</font>

476
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:24,718
there's actually eight white guys on the

477
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:26,789
stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> with remarkably similar</font>

478
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:29,580
backgrounds as you may have heard from

479
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:31,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're saying up here and i think</font>

480
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,029
that i think outreach is key right i

481
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:35,190
mean there are a lot of very capable

482
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:37,019
people who would make very positive

483
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,960
contributions to this community to this

484
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,749
board to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program committee to all</font>

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,549
facets of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and they do</font>

486
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:47,489
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be comfortable and i don't think</font>

487
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:49,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that always happens and we need to you</font>

488
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:50,909
know perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> in curt directly encourage</font>

489
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:55,259
individuals like specific individuals to

490
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:57,509
get involved in Kevin so the bylaw

491
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,639
change that is being proposed is a good

492
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:01,710
line items start it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings us</font>

493
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:03,839
in line with the Canadian<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements</font>

494
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,580
which when we're in Canada we would

495
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,769
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow but it is just a</font>

496
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,299
line item it's not actually an action

497
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,399
item it's not things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're actively</font>

498
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,349
doing that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the problem is</font>

499
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:16,550
as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> said earlier there's a whole bunch</font>

500
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:19,310
of the same diversity at the

501
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:21,169
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the biggest issue is putting</font>

502
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,409
our perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> on we what we think</font>

503
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:27,470
other people want and i think that the

504
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:30,740
reality is for a start we should not be

505
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,900
making we as in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the non-diverse should</font>

506
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,680
not be making<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decisions we should be</font>

507
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:40,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">bringing in advisors even having board</font>

508
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,230
liaison advisors to help us address some

509
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,180
of the issues with whatever the

510
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,700
diversity issues they then are able to

511
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring towards us we're not perfect we're</font>

512
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,270
not a political organization but I

513
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:55,340
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there needs to be an</font>

514
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:57,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">improvement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one of the interesting</font>

515
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,899
things about this election and these

516
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,630
candidates is that there are seemingly

517
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,790
many conflicts of interest that were

518
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,800
bought out during the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and</font>

519
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,409
these included folks who work for other

520
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,419
folks folks who have family

521
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,890
relationships and folks who serve on

522
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,500
other boards that are related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana</font>

523
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:20,240
and this these conflicts have seemed to

524
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">increase significantly this cycle if you</font>

525
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,040
have any conflicts of interest can you

526
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,770
very briefly tell us about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them how you</font>

527
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">will handle them and you know in</font>

528
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:36,139
particular things like boards employment

529
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:38,600
etc let's start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Paul so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

530
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,450
involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS I work as a board</font>

531
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:45,909
member which is it yet another technical

532
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:48,980
organization and beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

533
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,930
participating things like the IETF and

534
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,910
Sanders processes I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

535
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">those do you feel the ITF is a conflict</font>

536
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,830
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest no it's I'm just disclosing</font>

537
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,860
I don't I actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

538
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,300
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> complimentary in that regard</font>

539
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:05,510
beyond those are things that are purely

540
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,970
social in my case I have interests in

541
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,530
food music various other things but yeah

542
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,470
but please<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit to conflicts of</font>

543
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,480
interest so you said DNS Oh arc is there

544
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,090
is there a conflict there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if so how</font>

545
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,540
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you avoid it the only potential</font>

546
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:22,580
which which I've already dealt with is

547
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,520
we occasionally collocate conferences

548
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,870
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS Oh art and with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nan odd so when</font>

549
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything to do with a contract</font>

550
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">negotiation</font>

551
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:32,259
or something where there's any form of

552
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:34,330
financial exchange I refuse myself and

553
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:38,080
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> as close as I think I have to</font>

554
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,869
come Thank You Patrick I started with

555
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,059
Jezebel just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that there is</font>

556
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:46,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely not just any conflict but</font>

557
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:47,860
even an appearance of impropriety the

558
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,360
only remuneration if you can call that

559
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,758
that board members get is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your</font>

560
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,959
conference fee is paid so i will pay my

561
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,340
conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> fries or I will get my</font>

562
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,440
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay my conference fees more</font>

563
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,238
precisely so there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be absolutely no</font>

564
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,190
conflict I don't think she<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

565
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:02,619
married or not neither of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our companies</font>

566
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,999
none of our personal gain comes from

567
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:07,389
this conference so I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

568
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:09,220
a conflict there I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> my board</font>

569
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:11,408
memberships or anything on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

570
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,960
exchanges is that important I'd

571
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:15,399
appearing to be maybe you could say that

572
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,659
because they presented the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Boff</font>

573
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:18,100
there's some kind of conflict there but

574
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:20,139
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't think that's important I</font>

575
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,408
am standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Aaron board later</font>

576
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:25,059
this week I've spoken to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chairman of</font>

577
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:26,710
the nominations committee the president

578
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:27,850
CEO and the executive<font color="#E5E5E5"> director of nanog</font>

579
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,129
and none of them think that that is a

580
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,928
conflict either on neither does my

581
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:33,789
lawyer so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest thing I</font>

582
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,399
can do is be upfront about everything

583
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:37,989
that is a possible conflict explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

584
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,340
I'm really am trying everything I can to

585
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:41,529
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then recuse myself from</font>

586
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,980
anything that just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow</font>

587
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:47,950
Patrick you disclose your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Co eyes</font>

588
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,090
but how would you handle any conflict of

589
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,639
interest that came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Dan we're</font>

590
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,709
out of time sorry III this is a

591
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:55,090
follow-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> question please answer so like</font>

592
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,580
I said I would accuse myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> rimini</font>

593
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,799
think that would be a conflict that I

594
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,590
said that as it was beeping okay good I

595
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:06,730
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anyone heard that Aaron sure</font>

596
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:09,519
so my boss Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> temkin is currently on</font>

597
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:12,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board so there's that as a potential</font>

598
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,289
conflict of interest more than conflict

599
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,939
of interest there's probably just

600
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:21,129
conflict we we tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have vigorous</font>

601
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,529
discussions about things are you

602
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:27,100
involved in occasional discussions with

603
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:29,649
my boss there so there's that I think

604
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,330
the solution is anything that might be a

605
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:33,939
conflict of interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring up with the</font>

606
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:37,928
other board members if I need to recuse

607
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:40,470
myself I would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I also serve on</font>

608
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,750
the GPF board with Greg<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dendy I don't</font>

609
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:46,320
there's conflict in the near future

610
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,120
between gpf and nanog that we would run

611
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,908
into issues there but if anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font>

612
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,250
up i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's we would recuse</font>

613
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:55,260
ourselves or find a way with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

614
00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's acceptable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid conflict of</font>

kind of case in regards to on the Aaron

ASO AC the NRO NC with I can I don't

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:26,120
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has any direct relevance or</font>

623
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,260
conflict I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to dealing with</font>

624
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,408
conflicts from a fiduciary point of view

625
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,510
recusing myself overly documenting those

626
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:36,179
conflicts in some cases on a per call

627
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:39,330
basis as I see fit because I'm involved

628
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,789
in the industry but I'd say the biggest

629
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,189
thing right now is to look at nanog

630
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:46,379
actually adopting a best practices when

631
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,360
it comes to conflict I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

632
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,179
very lacks right now and really having

633
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,850
more information as to defining what

634
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,559
conflict is and not allowing it would

635
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,939
probably be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my number one okay</font>

636
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,129
have you read<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nanak's conflict of</font>

637
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,110
interest policy well based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm</font>

638
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,370
seeing on this table when it comes to

639
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,320
the elections i don't believe that nan

640
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:09,539
august following best practices<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

641
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:12,210
well join up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm on the open IX board</font>

642
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:13,919
I'm not intending to run for<font color="#CCCCCC"> re-election</font>

643
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,530
and that turns out at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

644
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,780
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in terms of nonprofits I guess</font>

645
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,340
that could I don't see I don't see a

646
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,129
conflict but I guess theoretically there

647
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,620
could be one I serve on my own board of

648
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,710
directors<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my own company and then</font>

649
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,689
like Patrick I have a conflict with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

650
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,610
of the other board members who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am now</font>

651
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:37,020
a partner with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of a startup</font>

652
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:38,428
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> where both partners and you know</font>

653
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,070
I guess the way I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> handle that is</font>

654
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:44,549
if somehow there ever came

655
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,590
of an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would recuse myself and</font>

656
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure Jezebel would recuse herself as</font>

657
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,120
well and actually we've done that I

658
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,559
think in committee selections we both

659
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,570
stepped out of the room and allowed the

660
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,129
rest of the board to to handle committee

661
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,399
selections because one of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees</font>

662
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:02,370
was up for nomination for one of those

663
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:04,908
so again I don't perceive any particular

664
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,350
conflict in terms of how nanog operates

665
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:11,360
this the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we became partners</font>

666
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,360
happened after we were both on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

667
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:17,970
all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NaN augs</font>

668
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:20,370
biggest challenge over the next five

669
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:26,100
years and what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do specifically</font>

670
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:27,570
to resolve it start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick so the</font>

671
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,459
typical answer is what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to meet</font>

672
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,899
remain financially solvent because

673
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,340
everybody's worried about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next big</font>

674
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:37,590
bust having<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with nanog during the</font>

675
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,090
what we called the revolution trust me

676
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,449
those were much worse time so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

677
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,889
had literally zero dollars I think

678
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,990
specifically frankly Ryan as treasurer

679
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:49,199
and Betty and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the board is</font>

680
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:51,539
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fantastic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job making relatively</font>

681
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,919
solvent I think the other thing and this

682
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:56,759
is a typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> honestly</font>

683
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:59,850
believe it is getting newer and more

684
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,320
diverse people into the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

685
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,959
I think letting them feel welcome

686
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,220
letting them know that while sure those

687
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,480
bunch of white guys up here there's a

688
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,409
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of white guys in the hall standing</font>

689
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,860
around talking to each other that

690
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:12,570
doesn't mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're female or a</font>

691
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,370
minority and you walk up to us that we

692
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,460
won't talk to you and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

693
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,989
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a way to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make them feel</font>

694
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,149
welcome is important so that's where

695
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,740
outreach comes and part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the</font>

696
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:23,758
educational stuff but part of it is just

697
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,350
reaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to people who are already</font>

698
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,570
network engineers that are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

699
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,908
and specifically inviting them to come

700
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:33,668
getting them to get here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

701
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:36,399
yeah in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind there's number of</font>

702
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,529
potential problems whether this is

703
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">financial whether this goes down whether</font>

704
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:43,599
this event gets too big I really think

705
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:46,059
that the key is kind of maintaining the

706
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:48,668
focus on education I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

707
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:51,970
educational organization from from an

708
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:54,070
IRS<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint I don't think we want to</font>

709
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,659
get too far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that because we</font>

710
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,418
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> run into potential legal problems</font>

711
00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:00,129
i also just think from an event

712
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:02,320
effectiveness standpoint we need to stay

713
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:06,879
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that educational mission and getting</font>

714
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:11,678
people in here to learn things Kevin so

715
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:13,959
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> um well I was called out earlier</font>

716
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,070
today where there was a perception that

717
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,779
I was running on the make nanog great

718
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:22,840
platform and in fact it was more along

719
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:26,820
the lines of keep now not great and to

720
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:30,220
me it's me an agreed again right well

721
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,320
the point was that i believe that it is

722
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:37,289
important to make sure that the ratio<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

723
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:40,450
sales versus education versus operator

724
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:42,879
he is realigned with with an optimum

725
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,679
balance I balls vs content network type

726
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:47,080
con things not through dis

727
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:51,460
incentivization but through incentive

728
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,978
I've a incentivization bringing in more

729
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:57,639
operators to counterbalance<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time</font>

730
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:59,739
bringing in more of the educational over

731
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:01,869
time because that is my concern that

732
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:04,149
five years from now there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

733
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:05,859
imbalance in the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that can be</font>

734
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:10,599
self-correcting but I'd rather have us

735
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:16,928
correct it through incentivization well

736
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:18,489
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calm okay so I see several</font>

737
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,889
challenges over the next five years I

738
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:23,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">think as the organization and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

739
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:24,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">conferences have grown managing that</font>

740
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,889
growth in a way that doesn't

741
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:30,549
disenfranchised the the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

743
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:35,739
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as Patrick mentioned we're on</font>

744
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:37,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">good financial ground we set some goals</font>

745
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:39,820
as a board in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of what we want to</font>

746
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:41,709
achieve in reserve policy I think

747
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,879
maintaining progress towards those goals

748
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:47,740
is important and i also think

749
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:49,869
getting new and fresh content is getting

750
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,559
harder it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to get people</font>

751
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:55,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come in and stand on the stage and</font>

752
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,799
open up the kimonos and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

753
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they do a little bit I think</font>

754
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do we</font>

755
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:02,918
encourage more people new people to come

756
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:06,669
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk about any topics that matter</font>

757
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,409
to this industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a whole and then you</font>

758
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:11,710
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are probably the</font>

759
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:15,700
three largest challenges for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

organization going forward and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul I</font>

761
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,330
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably our class the</font>

762
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,590
biggest concern is maintaining relevance

763
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,389
right now in a mega is a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

764
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,860
people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing interesting things</font>

765
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:28,709
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and present it's where</font>

766
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,258
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to learn about new things</font>

767
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:35,679
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've done a good job at</font>

768
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:37,629
getting a diverse set of topics out

769
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,320
there but I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we</font>

770
00:32:37,629 --> 00:32:43,330
need to maintain if we can keep more new

771
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,029
people coming in we can maintain the

772
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,539
quality of our program and maintain the

773
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:50,830
stature of how we are seeing externally

774
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,169
people will find the money to come to

775
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,549
this kind of conference it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never be</font>

776
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:56,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy but I think that the money will be</font>

777
00:32:54,549 --> 00:33:01,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">driven by whether or not it is seen as</font>

778
00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:03,850
useful excellent hey I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

779
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:06,939
the opportunity to open this up to folks

780
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,350
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience you know in the finest</font>

781
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,659
tradition of nanog people like to rock

782
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:13,269
the mic and and you know ask difficult

783
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:14,889
questions can we have anyone or anyone

784
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:18,869
who's an enigmatic come up to the mic

785
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:18,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">and ask something interesting</font>

786
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:27,629
this is your board folks might as well

787
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:30,210
ask questions now while you saunter up

788
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:32,639
to the mic<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we have someone now while</font>

789
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:36,210
you sent her up to the mic let me throw

790
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:39,418
one more question in we've got somebody

791
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:42,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">whoo-hoo all right Murr chair let's go</font>

792
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:47,100
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I SD Feldman CBS interactive of</font>

793
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:50,908
our board member I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask all the</font>

794
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:53,009
candidates what your opinion is on types

795
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:58,490
of training that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I could do and</font>

796
00:33:53,009 --> 00:34:01,019
whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> worthwhile I in particular</font>

797
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,119
thinking back to the classes that we

798
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,799
tried to do a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and the</font>

799
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,578
tutorials that we have now can we expand

800
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:13,589
on them is there a better idea start

801
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:17,849
with Aaron sure I think so my team deals

802
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:21,328
with a wide variety of ISPs in the

803
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:22,800
Americas and in Western Europe and quite

804
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:25,819
frankly a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there could</font>

805
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,490
could really use help on on basics of

806
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:32,849
whether that's peering or how prefixes

807
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:35,689
are distributing their network or what

808
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:38,819
they're doing just from a from a network

809
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,409
practices standpoint there's still a lot

810
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:42,659
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there that could use the</font>

811
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:44,460
help and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think on the the content side</font>

812
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,710
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of content and cloud</font>

813
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,960
providers that could use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> help on</font>

814
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:52,349
how to best deal with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these ISPs</font>

815
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,429
so yeah I think classes and tutorials

816
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:58,710
that we really push as a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

817
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:04,140
gateway<font color="#CCCCCC"> into nanog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really good</font>

818
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:06,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">approach so I've actually been fortunate</font>

819
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:11,819
to go to a number of nog events outside

820
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:15,990
of North America specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> afrinic</font>

821
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:18,390
and curb nog and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different</font>

822
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment when the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR and the network</font>

823
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:24,598
operators work together but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that being</font>

824
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:28,669
said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely believe having three</font>

825
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:32,050
and five day class environment basic 101

826
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,030
102 201 level of

827
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,340
things would definitely benefit bringing

828
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:40,450
in and incentivizing the new round of

829
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:43,600
engineers within the industry and then

830
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,370
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them come back in I don't</font>

831
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe it's a it's really cost issue</font>

832
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:50,650
it's a time and commitment issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a</font>

833
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,950
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> stipend will cover the costs in</font>

834
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,810
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of hotel for a smaller</font>

835
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,310
group to do that training but that

836
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,290
requires time and commitment and I

837
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:06,450
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nanog should be up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

838
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:08,680
task to do that so personal experience

839
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,640
when I was a young engineer attending

840
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">nano for the first time found the</font>

841
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,250
tutorials to be amazingly great in terms

842
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:18,040
of giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> me knowledge that made me</font>

843
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,780
better at my job so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that those</font>

844
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,430
are extremely valuable and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I encourage</font>

845
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what the newcomers lunch is for</font>

846
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,029
instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> i encourage newcomers to go to</font>

847
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:28,270
those there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information to be</font>

848
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:30,040
learned there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more you</font>

849
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:32,620
know Steve mentioned some of the

850
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,750
initiatives we started the educational

851
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:37,240
track was something that we wanted to

852
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,790
reboot and so as a board we've asked the

853
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,069
staff to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> in restructure some of the</font>

854
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,779
initiatives<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were started I don't</font>

855
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have any formal plans finalized</font>

856
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,890
yet but what we wanted to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is focus on</font>

857
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,110
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generation of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skill</font>

858
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">sets software combined with networking</font>

859
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,950
skills you know our industry is evolving

860
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,600
it's not just about logging into a

861
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,580
router anymore now you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

862
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,250
basic skill sets around software

863
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,990
engineering and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt like it was</font>

864
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,430
time to refresh that and we're in the

865
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:08,290
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing that but yeah I believe</font>

866
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:10,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">investing in that is a solid thing so I</font>

867
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,710
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually involved with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

868
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,740
attempts at developing curriculum and

869
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,600
I've done classes before I think that

870
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,790
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of pieces nanog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

871
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,950
the road in particular has been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

872
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">reuse material for certain standard</font>

873
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:25,930
tutorials like traceroute and intro to

874
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:28,990
bgp and that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pieces having</font>

875
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:30,660
material that we can use and reuse it's

876
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,520
not free and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not easy to come by</font>

877
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,529
the other pieces that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you then need</font>

878
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,230
someone who can consistently present it

879
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:40,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've had phenomenal response with</font>

880
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,850
people volunteering and being able to do

881
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,450
that teaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

882
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,950
step up our game

883
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,450
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

884
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,879
some more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are doing it more</font>

885
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,290
regularly and making a more formal you

886
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,680
know and maybe it's we<font color="#CCCCCC"> cover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

887
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,329
travel expenses or something to get the

888
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we know are doing good</font>

889
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:04,730
training out there and keeping the

890
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:06,079
material fresh all right let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font>

891
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,700
guys how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you actually went to</font>

892
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,210
university to study something and

893
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:13,040
computers are networking raise your hand

894
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now how many people just started</font>

895
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,839
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking without ever having</font>

896
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:19,160
gone to university yeah so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

897
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,540
there's a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there that</font>

898
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,490
never went to school but there's a lot

899
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,829
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who did so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do</font>

900
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:26,629
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue on the track and</font>

901
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:29,480
educate but my problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

902
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:32,089
wide wide diversity using that word

903
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,170
again of where the base level is so I

904
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:35,029
don't think nanog should be out there

905
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,500
doing you know Cisco or juniper 101

906
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,119
because first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is going to take</font>

907
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,140
many days it's not really our core<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

908
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:40,510
there are other places<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

909
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,098
I think it should be stuff that's

910
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,960
specific to an ISP or a CDN type

911
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:47,270
environment and then you should focus

912
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,079
more on that kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

913
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that the other stuff is</font>

914
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,069
irrelevant or useless but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

915
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,630
that's where we can add serious value

916
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:56,240
because you're not going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at</font>

917
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,740
a standard training session and you're

918
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to get that in your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> university</font>

919
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,549
skills and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people out</font>

920
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">there that get in and sure we could</font>

921
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,210
teach traceroute again and get rise up

922
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:11,000
there to wrap these days to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

923
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:13,310
I'm out of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> center Mike John</font>

924
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Christoph would Paul University first</font>

925
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,589
thank you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the candidates i think</font>

926
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,430
it's laudable that you're all volunteer

927
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:22,609
someone who teaches from the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

928
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">have is what specifically might or what</font>

929
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:28,130
have you done or what might you do to

930
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:29,630
attract content i know we see an email

931
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">go out in something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's on the web</font>

932
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,970
page but what more do you do or would

933
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,140
you do or could you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to point</font>

934
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,700
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not actually in the</font>

935
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,578
purview the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of directors of nano</font>

936
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,680
that's content generation selection is

937
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:44,329
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program committee can you rephrase</font>

938
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,919
that to make it more applicable to the

939
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:47,970
board

940
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:53,640
what would you do to encourage the

941
00:39:47,970 --> 00:40:02,250
program or advise them or guide them to

942
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:04,200
help produce strong content so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

943
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:07,380
actually on the program committee and I

944
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,700
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that having had breakfast</font>

945
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,450
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that purpose this</font>

946
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">morning with the board the board does a</font>

947
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:20,220
phenomenal job of being distant but

948
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:24,480
helpful and encouraging in regards<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

949
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:27,049
that it's a very difficult tightrope one

950
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,460
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being nuanced and</font>

951
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:32,310
because of concerns with the community

952
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,500
that that separation is important I'm

953
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,290
actually not that is one thing I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

954
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,780
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that the</font>

955
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:41,730
board should give the program committee

956
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,700
some latitude financially when it comes

957
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:47,520
to being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in speakers but</font>

958
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:54,089
that is a minor nuance to what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

959
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:58,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually very well-run never tell of</font>

960
00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:00,990
this is on yeah like Kevin said I think

961
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,460
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not visible to</font>

962
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,770
the community as a whole is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

963
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,450
maintained a fair amount of distance

964
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,310
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program committee and the</font>

965
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:10,980
board the program<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee's job is to</font>

966
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:13,529
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conference I think what we</font>

967
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,600
can do is when there are relevant topics

968
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,060
you know there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things where we may</font>

969
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,890
reach out to the liaison to the PC and

970
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,570
say hey do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have anybody who's</font>

971
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,490
addressing something that you know maybe

972
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:26,190
it's the cyber attacks that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

973
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:28,410
or whatever but we can though those are

974
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,060
the types of interactions that typically

975
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,160
occur between the board and then we we

976
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,890
take survey data and we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

977
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,960
that the program is meeting our

978
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,700
attendees expectations so there are

979
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,070
certain tracks or things that are not

980
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,480
performing you know we may encourage the

981
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,760
program community to take a closer look

982
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,650
at those tracks and determine whether

983
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,050
they're even necessary or whether they

984
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,730
need to be tweaked so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are</font>

985
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,650
the types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a board that we</font>

986
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,540
can do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of our charter we're</font>

987
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:57,580
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited in terms of those types of</font>

988
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,020
things so

989
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,390
the things that the board does is also

990
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,830
decide who is ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be one</font>

991
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:06,509
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> program committee from the</font>

992
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:09,580
candidate list and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

993
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,900
beyond what we were all saying then I'm

994
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,890
on the program committee as well right

995
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,550
now we have the discussion this morning

996
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:16,930
is yes if they can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us guidance and</font>

997
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,970
support and financial support that's

998
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,440
great but fundamentally I think one of

999
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,209
the other key things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the board can</font>

1000
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,400
do is make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program</font>

1001
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:27,220
committee that's picked has contacts

1002
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,230
goes to a wide variety of places has a

1003
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,330
wide variety of industry and other

1004
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,770
contacts because that's really where it

1005
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:35,799
happens you know sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> out mailing</font>

1006
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:37,509
lists blurbs does it get us a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1007
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,700
what we get we get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who buy their</font>

1008
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,260
been to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conference or it's someone</font>

1009
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:46,169
we know or we've seen somewhere and we

1010
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is of relevance to the community</font>

1011
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:50,890
so I don't want to do a me too but

1012
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,270
unfortunately you know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1013
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas up here I think that the</font>

1014
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,110
board should be giving the program

1015
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,210
committee more financial support I mean

1016
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,800
there are some people that would make

1017
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,870
great speakers but they can't pay their

1018
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,970
own way so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting that we</font>

1019
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,410
start giving honorariums but maybe you

1020
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a hotel or a flight or something</font>

1021
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,870
like that I think that's something we

1022
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,130
should look<font color="#CCCCCC"> into but I can't say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1023
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,230
sure we should do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I haven't</font>

1024
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen the finances very closely recently</font>

1025
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,470
that be something we'd look at as a

1026
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,910
board the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that everybody</font>

1027
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:19,149
is up here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1028
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:23,500
people and person-to-person contact is

1029
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:25,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best way to get new new speakers and</font>

1030
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,920
we all go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lots of conferences we all</font>

1031
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,140
see lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things so let's go out there</font>

1032
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and use our contacts to help the pc do</font>

1033
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,339
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcs job without telling them what to</font>

1034
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:37,420
do because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> separation of church and</font>

1035
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:39,820
state is vital in my opinion I think

1036
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,340
there are strategic relationships that

1037
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:45,520
whether you look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the board or</font>

1038
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:47,710
individual board members could have

1039
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,190
whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other conferences or</font>

1040
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:54,400
with universities in their area I mean

1041
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,740
each the board members i think tend to

1042
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,110
live in metropolitan areas a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1043
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,700
universities a lot of community<font color="#CCCCCC"> colleges</font>

1044
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:03,220
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think those strategic</font>

1045
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:07,149
relationships could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very helpful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1046
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:10,140
in assisting the program committee in in

1047
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,640
how they can get deeper into

1048
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,700
area and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's some of the</font>

1049
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,650
involvement that's perhaps lacking from

1050
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,368
from nanog over all of it that could be

1051
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:22,859
strengthened more and that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1052
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:30,930
board members have the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1053
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:33,660
that's something we can do all right any

1054
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:35,339
more questions from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crowd well y'all</font>

1055
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,308
think of something I've got another one

1056
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:41,640
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got pre-prepared in this age of</font>

1057
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:43,740
software development sdn how do we get

1058
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,078
new infrastructure network engineers

1059
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,450
involved in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and our Nana</font>

1060
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,829
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's specifically what you</font>

1061
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:55,140
do to help keep the router monkey alive

1062
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:57,990
and please no references to existing

1063
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:01,589
nanog programs we you know saying well

1064
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:05,598
we do accidents great is ok but you know

1065
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:08,250
what else can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do let's start with</font>

1066
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,680
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next will ya I'm just</font>

1067
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to think of an answer good oh we</font>

1068
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:18,288
can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back have a ball no I'll go</font>

1069
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:22,859
that's my thanks thanks though Dan I

1070
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:25,049
think as I mentioned earlier that it's

1071
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:27,029
pretty well recognized that the role of

1072
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:29,309
the engineer and the software developer

1073
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:32,609
are kind of integrating and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in</font>

1074
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:35,420
order to attract that<font color="#E5E5E5"> next generation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1075
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:37,950
kind of hybrid developer and engineer

1076
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:40,589
maybe some outreach is necessary it's

1077
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,210
going to you know having Betty and her

1078
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:43,799
staff maybe do some outreach or

1079
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,220
partnerships with some of the software

1080
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:49,619
developer conferences that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

1081
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:52,970
would would potentially bring new new

1082
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:57,660
audience new participation into nanog

1083
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:59,609
you know I think as a board were open to

1084
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,160
anything we've always been open to any

1085
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:04,650
idea it's a matter of where is your best

1086
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,990
bang for the buck going to be and so I

1087
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:09,599
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as long as we don't get into</font>

1088
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:11,459
locked into a method of thinking and as

1089
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,220
long as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to foster new ideas</font>

1090
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,299
we can continue to evolve and grow this

1091
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,299
organization for the best

1092
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,920
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we have done it's</font>

1093
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:25,410
a logistical challenge but I'm a huge

1094
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:28,700
fan of hackathons there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing like</font>

1095
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:31,649
getting your hands dirty in a room and

1096
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:35,069
getting folks to actually see something

1097
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:37,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">that works and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did from</font>

1098
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:38,940
scratch or turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it loose and see what</font>

1099
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:42,119
they'll think of that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would never</font>

1100
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,920
have occurred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you and they that seems</font>

1101
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:45,420
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a growing trend in a number of</font>

1102
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,039
conferences that I'm involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1103
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,490
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's certainly one of the</font>

1104
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,569
pieces getting back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some discussion</font>

1105
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,868
we've had with getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with</font>

1106
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:56,640
your local university maybe we come in

1107
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:59,490
to do a weekend seminar with some

1108
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,819
educational institution and get the guys

1109
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,049
who already<font color="#E5E5E5"> were working on coding with</font>

1110
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:10,710
the idea that maybe they can play with

1111
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">network boxes I love this this new sdn</font>

1112
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:14,700
thing and DevOps thing we had sdn in the

1113
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:19,379
90s we called it expects<font color="#E5E5E5"> scripts it was</font>

1114
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:21,269
awesome the thing is it really this

1115
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,920
convergence or whatever has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on hold</font>

1116
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:26,508
on that makes me makes me up like a

1117
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:29,430
nettop software developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> boom oh sorry</font>

1118
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:31,559
so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing this for a long time</font>

1119
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we've slowly</font>

1120
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:37,170
drifted away when I started coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

1121
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:40,019
dog you know a very long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago um did</font>

1122
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,999
all of the people doing router jockey

1123
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:44,038
stuff were coders they could write

1124
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:46,618
scripts at least they may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1125
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:49,230
had megabytes of code in a single app

1126
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:50,670
but they did code and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1127
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,829
it's separating is kind of sad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1128
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:54,539
mentioned earlier in the diversity let's

1129
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:56,940
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like the girls who code</font>

1130
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:59,190
our organization that wasn't an

1131
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,950
operational organization but it has

1132
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:03,239
direct relevance to what we do so sort

1133
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,549
of like will said reaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to</font>

1134
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:08,220
exactly those types of conferences

1135
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:11,069
organizations I don't know membership

1136
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,439
based things I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to watch the</font>

1137
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:15,509
clock more closely it's generally what

1138
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,819
the answer is our next question will be

1139
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:22,619
on time management skills<font color="#CCCCCC"> error hey you</font>

1140
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:24,180
used my time I was being generous you

1141
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:25,799
know it's funny because in like five

1142
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,149
minutes we went from<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that's all part</font>

1143
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:30,420
of the program committee to we all have

1144
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,680
a real opinion on sdn so to some extent

1145
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really do too</font>

1146
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,279
a large extent I think that's on the

1147
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,339
program committee for whatever the

1148
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,319
flavor of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next five years or you</font>

1149
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:42,420
know five-year fad because we've seen

1150
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,359
this over and over again regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1151
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,520
exactly what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I just come back to</font>

1152
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,480
you know the board is here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to represent</font>

1153
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,680
kind of specifically the membership and

1154
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,720
in the program committee is here to

1155
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,910
program topics that people in the

1156
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,140
audience want to hear I think we can

1157
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,750
look at this from a strategic

1158
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,670
perspective as well and try to get

1159
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:05,700
people on that quite frankly I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1160
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:08,069
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just encourage vigorous debate I</font>

1161
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,629
the pc is a little hamster<font color="#CCCCCC"> on because no</font>

1162
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:12,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">one's going to get up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

1163
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:16,740
spent three years and six million

1164
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:20,190
dollars and how many man years on this

1165
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:21,720
absolute awful sdn thing and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1166
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,000
like to share this<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you I mean I</font>

1167
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,649
haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that presentation yet but</font>

1168
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,660
I'm sure it's happening right and I

1169
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:32,910
think we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that debate going on</font>

1170
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:34,500
I think one of the issues is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

1171
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:37,170
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the programming but related</font>

1172
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:40,829
to how the organization interacts with

1173
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,980
the younger generation I guess you could

1174
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:47,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">say we're not having a debate about</font>

1175
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fortran</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus pearl versus Pascal if</font>

1176
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:51,030
you did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a new engineer they</font>

1177
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:53,970
would dies we'd be glossed over and I

1178
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the issue is that you know</font>

1179
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:59,299
my kids are using snapchat I had to

1180
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:01,290
learn what that was it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us to be</font>

1181
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:03,750
using the tools that the current

1182
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">generation is using when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to how</font>

1183
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:09,450
the organization operates out markets

1184
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:11,759
the marketing and the tools that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1185
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:14,669
in the conference need to be brought

1186
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,020
into the 21st century so that people are

1187
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,640
comfortable being a part of the

1188
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,910
community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't get confused</font>

1189
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:23,520
with whether we're using VI or emacs we

1190
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:26,328
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're well beyond that argument</font>

1191
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,250
so from an SDN point of view we need to

1192
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:30,450
wake up to what the technologies are

1193
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,329
that are being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> and used the mess</font>

1194
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">else and I think with all due respect we</font>

1195
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:38,960
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fortran one that one</font>

1198
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wakefield Twitter I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if any</font>

1199
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:51,190
of you had any opinions on I would say

1200
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:54,680
the the balance of influence with our

1201
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:57,410
spot with nanog sponsors and vendors

1202
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:00,200
that come to the meeting just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font>

1203
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:02,149
we obviously depend on sponsorship<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1204
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,879
help run the show but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the</font>

1205
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:08,990
vendors there they sponsor because they

1206
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:13,700
they want to sell things I know on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1207
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:16,848
pc we do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work to try to keep</font>

1208
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,589
blatant marketing out of the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1209
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:21,980
at the same time it seems that there's

1210
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:24,290
there's a their desire for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano</font>

1211
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,740
could try to keep this a vendor neutral

1212
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:29,599
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> an educational organization</font>

1213
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,459
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the current state of</font>

1214
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,030
the racial ship with our vendors and

1215
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:36,200
sponsors is at a point it should be do

1216
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:42,920
you think that anything needs to be

1217
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:45,500
adjusted yeah so we've certainly done

1218
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,450
that tap dance quite often I don't think

1219
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">that tap dance will ever go away I think</font>

1220
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:51,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people whose job in life is to sell</font>

1221
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:53,960
things are going to push and sell things

1222
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:56,599
and so it's up to us to decide whether

1223
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,829
that's a cultural fit or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1224
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:59,480
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the most part we've done a</font>

1225
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:02,869
pretty good job of doing that balance of

1226
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,849
not having our culture polluted work or

1227
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:09,079
change but gotten the benefit of having

1228
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:11,630
vendors involved the short answer is yes

1229
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:14,990
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the split is actually fine</font>

1230
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:16,880
this room is sort of involved up you get

1231
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:20,899
no vendor presentations you know modular

1232
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,160
Josh but you get no vendor presentations

1233
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,420
up here in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC does a great job the</font>

1234
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,040
fact that the pc never talks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1235
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,480
sponsor is intentional and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1236
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,349
that's great and it should stay that way

1237
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,420
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the fact that nana</font>

1238
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:34,400
hasn't raised prices in 13 15 years

1239
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,589
something like that is amazing if they

1240
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,060
double price today it would be still an

1241
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:39,140
amazing conference so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think they're</font>

1242
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,049
doing a very good job of getting the

1243
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:43,009
vendors in sorry the sponsors in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1244
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:44,750
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing a very good job of</font>

1245
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,369
keeping the sponsors out of the

1246
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,480
presentations so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font>

1247
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:50,530
balance is fine

1248
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,510
yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with it</font>

1249
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">today I do think you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very</font>

1250
00:52:54,510 --> 00:53:02,080
cognizant of what's going on to not let

1251
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,140
that line get crossed right it's the

1252
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:09,460
conference's who do provide slots for

1253
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:12,100
people and have that influence from from

1254
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,960
sponsors those presentations are awful

1255
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:17,560
right like we've all SAT through them

1256
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:22,660
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not helpful to anyone and</font>

1257
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:24,310
you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to that point so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1258
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,529
look around this room and I don't see

1259
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:30,390
one banner advertisement for one company

1260
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:32,830
anywhere on the walls I don't see any<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1261
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:35,549
well other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than ourselves that's not it</font>

1262
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:38,500
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe there's a</font>

1263
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:41,350
phenomenal respect right now with it

1264
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:45,700
between the sponsors that are here and

1265
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:49,000
the community there is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> black line</font>

1266
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:50,970
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's not gray if it was gray I</font>

1267
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,260
think it would get trodden on very fast

1268
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:56,500
and I would be very concerned about

1269
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:57,640
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> went into a gray area I</font>

1270
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,170
think the way it's been done is

1271
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:04,120
excellent and should continue to be done

1272
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:06,340
this way yeah i agree i think one of the

1273
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,589
reasons i started<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kept coming back to</font>

1274
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:11,230
nanog was because I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1275
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:13,540
digest a lot of marketing nonsense in

1276
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:16,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general session I think we've been</font>

1277
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:18,550
very vigilant as an organization about

1278
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,580
keeping that out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general sessions</font>

1279
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:25,270
and I think as long as like like my

1280
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:27,490
fellow nominees here said as long as we

1281
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:30,190
maintain that<font color="#CCCCCC"> vigilance in in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1282
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:31,959
cognizant of the community and what the

1283
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,790
community wants they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1284
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,020
bombarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that kind of stuff in the</font>

1285
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,840
general session we get enough of that at

1286
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:40,150
our day job and that's the whole point

1287
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,800
here is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how do you</font>

1288
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,780
run networks better what are the

1289
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,030
technologies and protocols and other

1290
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,520
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be cognizant of</font>

1291
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,350
and implementing in your network

1292
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,840
works in order to be successful and I

1293
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:53,910
think the culture here is such that it

1294
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,490
like you said there'd be a huge backlash

1295
00:54:53,910 --> 00:55:00,600
if that were ever to change I wouldn't

1296
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:02,759
support it in anyways thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1297
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,200
well with the class a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes we</font>

1298
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,510
have remaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have one final question</font>

1299
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:09,950
we'll start with Patrick if you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1300
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:13,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">any routing protocol which one and why</font>

1301
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:18,390
any routing protocol there's not a layer

1302
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">three only Patrick Oh ruined everything</font>

1303
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:24,770
I would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp because it is the</font>

1304
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:27,620
protocol that controls all protocols

1305
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:31,320
arid I have to pick a routing protocol

1306
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:33,420
you can be a copycat I was gonna pick

1307
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,660
vgp too but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only because we're on</font>

1308
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp for dude oh oh good were you waiting</font>

1309
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:43,080
for that was that I could set up i would

1310
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:44,279
go the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp because that's helping</font>

1311
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,400
networks connect to each other and

1312
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,370
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting how's it feel</font>

1313
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,260
like so could be funny and say CDP is a

1314
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:55,080
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing protocol for some of the</font>

1315
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,480
older in the room but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually bgp the</font>

1316
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,430
reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I've been burned with so many</font>

1317
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,360
other protocols over the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

1318
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:06,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing that just keeps on working</font>

1319
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:08,780
yeah i think my turn right I think

1320
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,100
you've summarized it well bgp has scaled

1321
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:16,200
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a running running protocol</font>

1322
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:19,140
chuck e GP has scaled better than any of

1323
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:21,810
the other protocols it has it's not

1324
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,700
perfect but it's it's getting the job

1325
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:26,610
done and it continues to get the job

1326
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:31,109
done and so I I guess that's where I

1327
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:33,150
would fall to probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to be mildly</font>

1328
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:36,180
contrary I might consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is because</font>

1329
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:37,770
in large-scale backbones if your routers

1330
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:42,450
can talk to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other bgp isn't going</font>

1331
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:45,030
to do a whole lot can I answer this too

1332
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:46,799
okay Ryan legend shoes I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

1333
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">their what what routing protocol would</font>

1334
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:55,320
you three be how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to go first</font>

1335
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I'll go eigrp and Dan would be the</font>

1336
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,730
end doesn't have to run before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1337
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the eigrp but because it's the first</font>

1338
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:03,450
routing protocol that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

1339
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,480
network engineers learn how to use or

1340
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:08,669
tricked into using potentially and it

1341
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,380
teaches them what a routing protocol is

1342
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:16,829
in a lot of cases deprecated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1343
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:20,520
retired well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> old-school the rip v2</font>

1344
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:23,010
for life Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-school you should go EGP</font>

1345
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would choose rtmp because it's old and</font>

1346
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:32,490
chatty<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right folks any there's no</font>

1347
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:34,649
