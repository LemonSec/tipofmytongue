scientists just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to communicate</font>

220
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,820
and create some cool things for search

221
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,439
so pretty neat and what does that

222
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,660
created internet usage around the world

223
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
any security hacks out here probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

224
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,800
few this is a botnet everybody had like

225
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,600
botnets probably not but this actually

226
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,099
was pretty neat they did a test create

227
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,870
took a big botnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually measure</font>

228
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,890
traffic flows around the world just

229
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,480
showing that we actually operated

230
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,600
24-hour business now what we do is

231

243
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,959
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the big marketing slide we have</font>

244
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,320
over 900 customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 of the fortune 20</font>

245
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,570
over 170 of the fortune 1000 we really

246
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">served the fort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000l and gas financials</font>

247
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,620
most of the large content companies and

248
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,050
cloud companies are our customers mostly

249
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,550
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and we are building literally</font>

250
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,990
millions of square feet at a time and

251
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,510
you'll see a demonstration of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a</font>

252
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,380
second big focus is building data

253
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,670
centers what I

254
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,560
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interconnection side making sure</font>

255
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those customers can reach cloud</font>

256
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,099
reach content reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> network reach other</font>

257
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,980
data centers for active active

258
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,470
replication and good stuff like that so

259
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,910
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little demo of if al gets it</font>

260
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,200
going here of a time lapse of a data

261
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,689
center we built<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in Virginia over</font>

262
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,030
200,000 square feet and this is actually

263
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,770
30 megawatts that went up in 180 days

264
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,660
which as far as we know in the industry

265
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,130
building data centers is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> record this</font>

266
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">was for a single customer who bought it</font>

267
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">all at once and wanted to move in</font>

268
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,630
immediately so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build this</font>

269
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,860
thing incredibly quickly and it's always

270
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun to watch these things to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

271
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,920
see how quick those goes up and notice

272
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the number of generators there guys so</font>

273
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,630
that's 30 megawatts of backup going in

274
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:40,700
in a full 2n architecture so pretty

275
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">impressive so pretty proud of what we do</font>

276
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,340
this is a data center we've acquired up

277
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,170
in Aurora outside of Chicago this

278
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,390
chicago mercantile exchange data center

279
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,589
92 megawatts of power at 2n this is the

280
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">matching engine for the futures market</font>

281
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,920
for the entire world it does four times

282
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,510
the volume of the New<font color="#E5E5E5"> York Stock</font>

284
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,200
year and has diverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> long haul from</font>

285
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,370
downtown Chicago so we're excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

286
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,470
this we're building over a million

287
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,700

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,690
the world but a data center without

300
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,550
connectivity is like a car without

301
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,040
wheels this happens to be a car in Cuba

302
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:35,520
go figure which you can now go visit and

303
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think dave has right yeah so what do</font>

304
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,310
we do on the connectivity side<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

306
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:44,130
we actually put in dual DWDM platforms

307
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,570
edge Ethernet access taking the data

308

continue to grow that<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend data</font>

311
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,410
centers and create an extension of the

312
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,210
ecosystem<font color="#E5E5E5"> which breaks any wall garden</font>

313
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,860
taking metros like you would do in

314
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,060
Europe with am-6 and links and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D kicks</font>

315
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,650
and actually making that part of our

316
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,760
ecosystem here in the US so that's a big

317
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,959
focus of what I do it at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CyrusOne what</font>

318
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,730
that allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers to do is</font>

319
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,900
access all the content and network and

320
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,860
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make the internet work and a</font>

321
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,300
lot of these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our customers</font>

322
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,100
already but if they're not or if those

323
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,910
networks aren't they<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't able to be</font>

324
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,440
there we

325
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,910
actually tap into those ecosystems at

326
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,090
the karyotype or an enterprise who would

327
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">never co-locate inside that environment</font>
