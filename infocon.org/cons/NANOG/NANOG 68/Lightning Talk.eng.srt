everybody give it up for Justin

Justin Reverend my<font color="#E5E5E5"> title is consulting</font>

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,830
engineer with juniper networks that's

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,198
just a fancy way of saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an sc</font>

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,349
essentially what I'm going to be talking

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:37,110
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys about today is SNMP must die</font>

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,370
the tyranny avoids essentially a

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,820
comparison<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current telemetry</font>

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,220
model that we use today with SNMP and I

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:49,690
do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little visual aid here shirts</font>

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,160
as a death to SNMP so the goal here in

15
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,190
my opinion is to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better</font>

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,019
method of getting telemetry data out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

17
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:01,750
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network infrastructure then doing</font>

00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:03,969
S&P Boyd gets like we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,619
so start off question anybody in the

20
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:13,330
audience know off the top of their head

21
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:17,710
what this is nobody all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right yes it is</font>

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">an SNMP mibbe or specifically that one</font>

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,439
there happens to be the operational

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,490
status of interface from the if' mid

25
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,779
thankfully nobody got that right because

26
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,820
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had known that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you</font>

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,070
probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to seek some mental health</font>

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,600
professionals because<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

29
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:36,580
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that memorized in their head</font>

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">right how about this one anybody take a</font>

31
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,810
guess at even if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not familiar</font>

32
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,430
with streaming telemetry and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang</font>

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,750
model for interfaces from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ittf</font>

34
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,780
anybody want to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guess what that</font>

35
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is all right same information it's the</font>

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,759
operational status for an interface

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:58,240
using a streaming telemetry model to get

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:02:00,189
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data so what makes other than</font>

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">just obviously the ease of seeing what</font>

40
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,949
it is that you're requesting and

41
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,299
potentially being able to actually

42
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,000
memorized them what is it it make

43
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,739
streaming telemetry better than SNMP I

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,030
think the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that always comes</font>

45
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:13,030
up when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,000
streaming telemetry and its value / /

47
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,000
SNMP is that it's a push model versus a

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,829
pull model so instead of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,200
monitoring station going and doing S&P

50
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:25,360
gets of voids and getting values back

51
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,649
you're actually configuring your network

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,300
infrastructure through one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a couple</font>

53
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">methods</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to push the day</font>

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,690
a two-year management station so it

55
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,340
collects the data on box and pushes it

56
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">out in a streaming fashion hence the</font>

57
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,650
name streaming telemetry to your gear

58
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,330
management station I think you know

59
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in no particular order as far</font>

60
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,570
as important in my opinion just things

61
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,429
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I put them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

62
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,590
slide but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next thing that I think of</font>

63
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not all information is stored an</font>

64
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,390
SNMP I'm sure all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as operators</font>

65
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,590
have run across the problem where it's

66
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,350
like gee I'd like to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font>

67
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,450
value out of my box that I can get in

68
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:02,049
CLI but my vendor hasn't implemented

69
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,060
that as a SNMP mibbe so what do i do I

70
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,360
have to go screens grape or something

71
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,680
along those lines to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data and</font>

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,220
I'm not a very good programmer but I

73
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">always struggle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

74
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next and that kind of leads me to my</font>

75
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,510
next point another advantage that

76
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:22,210
streaming telemetry has is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's based on</font>

77
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,910
model definitions that give us much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

78
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,730
structured way of getting the data so

79
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,590
it's much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ingest into whatever</font>

80
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,540
systems were writing if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps</font>

81
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,390
folks that or if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DevOps person</font>

82
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,940
yourself much<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that data</font>

83
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,040
understand what it is to write code and

84
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,780
logic around that data you know what

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,890
type of value you're going to get back

86
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,470
you know they're gonna get an integer or

87
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,589
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a string so it's</font>

88
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:50,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">very it's very much more easy to be to</font>

89
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,660
approach it's also very extendable

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,620
similar to I guess in this case it's

91
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,640
it's similar to SNMP where you can have

92
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,130
standards models that are defined

93
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry-wide you can have them defined</font>

94
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,190
by the IETF you can have them to find by

95
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open config community if you're</font>

96
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,370
familiar with some of their young model

97
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,988
work and the vendors can also have

98
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,980
specific models for things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be</font>

99
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,300
specific to their their implementation

100
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,799
there are a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different transport</font>

101
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,260
options that we can use for this we

102
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,820
could use UDP where we just fire it out

103
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,930
of the device and forget and hope that

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">it gets to where it's going on a</font>

105
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:27,880
management station which might have some

106
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:30,370
some scaling and benefits to it but

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,050
obviously has the downside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

108
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,390
knowing whether the data got there or

109
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,370
not and not having encryption on the on

110
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,130
the mechanism we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a TCP based</font>

111
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,460
version that is being worked on and I

112
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font>

113
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,940
vendors are starting to implement that

114
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,400
allows you of course authenticate your

115
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,259
TCP session sequence number<font color="#CCCCCC"> error check</font>

116
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,539
all the things that you expect of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

117
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,979
based session for transporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data</font>

118
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:55,870
which you obviously can't do today<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

119
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:58,210
SNMP and the argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it's</font>

120
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,400
scalable and so the question is is it

121
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,840
really scalable and this happens to be

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,758
since I happen to work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> juniper I</font>

123
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,469
have easier access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data this</font>

124
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,340
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on a on a Juniper device</font>

125
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:12,759
on a routing engine this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,880
there are multiple vendors that are

their implementation of this and the

main reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk</font>

190
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,650
on how this all works at a future an

00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">analog so if you have interest in that</font>

email address<font color="#E5E5E5"> is here please let me know</font>

193
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:49,449
I'm kind of trying to figure out what

194
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,289
the little interest might be in that

195
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:52,460
that's all I don't know are we doing

196
00:07:51,289 --> 00:08:02,599
questions now you want two questions the

197
00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:04,789
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright thanks sorry all right yeah</font>

these lightning talks if anybody out

217
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:07,219
more today we see overlay Network right

218
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:10,279
be it CDN<font color="#E5E5E5"> network overlay over existing</font>

219
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,560
infrastructure I could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT could be</font>

220
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,259
video conference network so a lot lots

221
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,449
of overlay networks over the top of the

222
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:20,029
shared infrastructure which include

223
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:25,639
routers which is things network

224
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:27,319
functions virtual so the security for

225
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,990
the virtual network there are many

226
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:33,199
aspects for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security right so there</font>

227
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,990
could be a triple-a authentication

228
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:38,240
authorization a lot of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work has</font>

229
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,029
been done at the overlay layer so they

230
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,689
have the on Triple A an engine to do the

231
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:47,120
authentication um but for other aspect

232
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:49,550
though there are parts can be done by

233
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,129
the overlay but underlay can provide

234
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,979
lots of features lots of capabilities to

235
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:58,339
reduce the pain overlay Network and feel

236
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,850
especially if you overlay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network is</font>

237
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:04,879
under attack like your access<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports your</font>

241
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:17,809
traffic they need to receive or could be

242
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,559
delivering from between overlay nodes

243
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:25,040
those other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be supported</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

244
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,949
the underlay the IETF iTunes SF is to

245
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,800
provide this hooks to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the underlay</font>

246
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:33,378
network to provide this interface to

247
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,508
allow the overlay be able to dictate how

248
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:39,949
traffic should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be delivered one to</font>

249
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:43,370
deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and how to deliver so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

250
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:45,729
the overlay Network lost more one more

251
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:50,540
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see the endpoint being</font>

252
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,910
mobile right um this be wide OD bring

253
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own device to campus allow</font>

254
00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:03,230

255
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:06,769
so security is a big issue so with with

256
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:09,470
overlay Network themselves imposing

257
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:11,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">security rules as imposing security</font>

258
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,790
functions they have their limitation

259
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:16,490
even though you could have encrypted

260
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,490
traffic between your overlay nodes just

261
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,110
you cannot provide prevent DDoS attack

262
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,950
and

263
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:29,269
and also that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of predefined</font>

264
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:32,690
header<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you use headed as a criteria</font>

265
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:35,180
to set up rules those kind of header can

266
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,970
be compromised for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may have</font>

267
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,569
a video conference and network and you

268
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:45,620
only allow a top to be with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

269
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:48,620
port number but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that static</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set up</font>

270
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,110
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a range of ports to be</font>

271
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:55,300
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate among those and</font>

272
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:59,839
those in the overlay Network and but any

273
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:03,199
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sophisticated users can pack to</font>

274
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:08,570
those information be able to of attack

275
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,540
those overlay nodes so the itune SF

276
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,600
approach is to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overlay Network</font>

277
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,899
be able to dynamically set up the pores

278
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,959
example we are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> WebEx conference</font>

279
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,490
call and when you request<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call to</font>

280
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,810
the WebEx controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just using</font>

281
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,540
WebEx as an example the conference call

282
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:32,089
controller can set up the UDP port for

283
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,910
this communication between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a and B at</font>

284
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:38,029
the same time this country<font color="#E5E5E5"> um controller</font>

285
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:40,730
can send a dynamic roll to the underlay

286
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:44,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network saying a and B with this UDP</font>

number equal to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 98 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk once this</font>

288
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,120
talk is finished then that rules it

289
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:54,709
removed so with that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can guarantee</font>

290
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:57,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">when a particular node is under mission</font>

291
00:12:54,709 --> 00:13:02,420
critical missions doing some work no

292
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:05,209
other traffic can saturate the link so

293
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,120
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is true allow the applications or</font>

294
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:12,800
evolution controller to dynamically set

295
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:16,339
up the rules or their communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

296
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,920
um many of the companies here have been

297
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:22,760
doing like automation right but the key

298
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,510
of automation is to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

299
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,370
standard interface um with

300
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,160
virtualization like now we have lots of

301
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,950
virtualized network functions

302
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,040
virtualization in the network it

303
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,740
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible for the provider service</font>

304
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,949
provider to provide security solutions

305
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,200
based on the client need the client can

306
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,540
specify what kind of rules they need to

307
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,420
have and then the provider be able to

308
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,400
find the service functions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

309
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,280
virtual service functions and

310
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,550
instantiate them at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right location</font>

311
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:01,130
to do to achieve the optimal protection

312
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:03,740
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is different vendors</font>

313
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,110
even though they may have same function

314
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,800
all those functions simple function like

315
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,090
a firewall be one vendor and another

316
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,430
vendor they all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

317
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:16,610
interfaces right so making this

318
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,370
automation very difficult to achieve or

319
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,740
making it very troublesome whenever you

320
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,320
have a new vendor introduced and then

321
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,420
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change your interface so I</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> nefs goal is to be able to provide</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">those standardized interface and force</font>

324
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,450
those dynamic rules and for vendors if

325
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,430
they do already have the own

326
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,250
implementation they can put a shim layer

327
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,160
to translate this I ETF standard

328
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:45,890
interface to their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> event line so</font>

329
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,540
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goals for iTunes SF is</font>

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,300
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have those kind of in a</font>

331
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,939
standard interface so for the service

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,010
provider security service provider to be

333
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,770

different security functions and use

336
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:10,340
them or their client<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here is the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">framework of I to NSF I'll I try</font>

338
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,710
yourself we have two types of interfaces

<font color="#CCCCCC">to have the policies based on client</font>

346
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:42,439
addresses client IDs and then the

347
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,130
controller can be able to translate

348
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,940
those kind of client-oriented rules to

349
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,540
the

352
00:15:53,660 --> 00:16:00,230
we called NSF facing interface um the

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules over the NSF is the interface</font>

354
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,680

357
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:16,360
here is the vendor registration when we

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:21,500
did this a multi-vendor service Chang

360
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,380
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we realize that different vendors</font>

361
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,290
have different same function they have

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">different capabilities and when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

366
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,319
have different capabilities um but

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,750
different name may have same

368
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,610

369
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,190
automation or work you need a

00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:33,290
there's a youtube video showing the demo

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,850
command a show on the YouTube due to

to do the demo here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I highly</font>

390
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,430
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to watch the YouTube and</font>

391
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,679
to see the vendor implementation with

that that's it and any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

393
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:01,780
welcome to talk to me at the the social

394
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,780
tonight thank you

395
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,370
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you very much Linda next</font>

396
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,050
up we have Mike Kirchner and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

397
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:19,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell you about verifying your network</font>

398
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:22,220
topology using packet injection um Cole

399
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,170
actually it's my first minute so I'm a

400
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit nervous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it should be fine</font>

401
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:31,730
so my topic is about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify a</font>

402
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,150
network connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using network</font>

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,360
where sometimes improperly connected

404
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,730
cable allegis to fold which hard to

405
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:45,260
troubleshoot or hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify it</font>

406
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:48,410
first and um<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to solve this</font>

407
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:52,940
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with software approach so how we</font>

408
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:56,770
how we are doing um at first<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

409
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:59,180
some kind of topology representation and

410
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:02,270
different solutions are available um

411
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:05,480
most popular topology representation

412
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:09,410
formats would be llamo and Jason so you

413
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:14,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify your note and everything is</font>

414
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:17,570
needed um every link I will have a name

415
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:20,380
and we implement the solution for a

416
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,200
vagrant for example but it could be um

417
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:27,050
for any<font color="#CCCCCC"> armed orchestration method so um</font>

418
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,590
you have the podium and<font color="#CCCCCC"> orchestrator</font>

419
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:33,710
will spin up<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beast apology for you and</font>

421
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:43,100

422
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,970
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution itself uh what is our</font>

423
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:49,820
packet injection and how we approach to

424
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:54,740
solve this problem um we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

425
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:59,389
about any<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm routing protocols and what</font>

426
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:02,290
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> only a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linux based system which</font>

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:28,310
packet um at first we should specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

435
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:31,460
sender port which we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it will</font>

436
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:34,639
be some a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fernet poor or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our linux for</font>

437
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,690
example and we will need destination MAC

438
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,450
address um python script arm which is

439
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:45,170
part of solution will connect to every

440
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:47,420
available device presage am and will

441
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:51,410
retrieve destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> MAC so now we have</font>

442
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">our Oh topology um Oh devices with all</font>

443
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:58,400
available mac addresses a second step

444
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:01,430
script boom arm trigger will connect to

445
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">each device and each device will be</font>

446
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:11,030
considerate as center<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh package and as</font>

447
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:18,140
a receiver so um every every device will

448
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">be presented in two rolls um let's look</font>

449
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,850
at work flow um everything is open

450
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:28,670
source you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through this link and</font>

451
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:30,980
download the files um actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you</font>

452
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,600
did it um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to set up your</font>

453
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,900
environment it's pretty simple and

454
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:40,189
already predefined you just use vagrant

455
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:42,500
up or spinning up the boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after</font>

456
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,780
you need to apply for books just for

457
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:53,860
some password place after ization based

458
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:58,190
on keys and popping some files um um

459
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:02,120
let's look how we do it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the manual</font>

460
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:06,620
way and um in manual way we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

461
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:10,070
trigger script<font color="#CCCCCC"> sandro provide used port</font>

462
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:13,520
to which we won't send packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

463
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,530
reach just two IP addresses it could be

464
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,389
any IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we really don't</font>

465
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:20,510
care because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I mentioned previously</font>

466
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:25,100
it's not routing based solution it's

467
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:27,830
pure packet injection and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care</font>

468
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:31,789
about IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and win</font>

469
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:35,870
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a destination</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> MAC address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our to</font>

470
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:39,169
reach our neighbor so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet is</font>

471
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:42,469
sent we should run<font color="#E5E5E5"> on receiver node um</font>

472
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:46,730
usual TCP dump and most system sub

473
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:49,940
support TCP dump and we will receive our

474
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:53,690
packet with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> current provided IP</font>

475
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,480
address and that's how we verify that

476
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">our link established between these two</font>

477
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,269
devices as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned previously if</font>

478
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,549
port is down we<font color="#CCCCCC"> canna do it and all we</font>

479
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:09,820
need is basic linux based system plus

480
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:13,750
tcp damn now we will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

481
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python workflow script is already a</font>

482
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,929
region and you can simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it um it</font>

483
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:24,950
will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each notes available in arm</font>

484
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:28,850
the pole in our topology um llamo file

485
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:32,720
is used by default and you find tapa del

486
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:36,379
t amo pile in<font color="#CCCCCC"> github</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and a</font>

487
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,470
result of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this script will be a list of</font>

488
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:42,049
all available devices and divisive

489
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,360
connections problem in between so

490
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:47,779
something is wrong and you want to

491
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:51,110
verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> with arm for example server 2 and</font>

492
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:53,990
so 2 is connected properly um also for

493
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,870
way of a vagrant our implementation if

494
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:59,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll show you what's wrong and which</font>

495
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,239
links you want to enhance or not to

496
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:07,029
enhance or to correct because may be

497
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:10,909
linked in vagrants open just one of side

498
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:16,090
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned everything is on</font>

499
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:19,490
github check out our new site x-art dogs

500

502
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,889
big bigger open-source test framework

503
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:33,789
and my colleague will present it

name is joe<font color="#E5E5E5"> giglio from Clarkson and</font>

510
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:12,469
actually this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixth nanog it is</font>

511
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:16,610
2010 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I were a student</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i attended</font>

512
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:19,040
nanog and I benefit a lot and that's why

513
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:22,850
you know every year I regularly attended

514
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,639
at least one nanog and theists last year

515
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:28,820
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> college immersion</font>

516
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,530
program so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already have a nine</font>

517
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,570
students supported by an<font color="#CCCCCC"> egg nog this</font>

518
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,700
program and to come over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

519
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:40,309
we have something to some pseudo here

520
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:42,620
you may already talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so yeah</font>

521
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:46,250
this is a great community and with great

522
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,689
people like you here but you know where

523
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,000
i talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people the first question</font>

524
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,850
they come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me is that vary from</font>

525
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,260
yeah actually we are clarkson university

526
00:25:52,850 --> 00:26:01,760
is in apps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> new york at the border us</font>

527
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:07,780
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> alexander and we are a small private</font>

528
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:10,490
university but its research oriented so

529
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:14,360
we are at the computer science

530
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:16,970
department and we have some labs so we

531
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,120
have Clarkson open source in slabs you

532
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:22,490
know internet teaching labs and the

533
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtual reality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lab and all these labs</font>

534
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,429
actually a good feature is that our

535
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:30,980
student or our student alma street and

536
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:34,040
they maintain all these networks server

537
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:39,130
software and hardware and even we have

538
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:42,020
official mirror site for linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> distros</font>

539
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,750
actually every day we have about van

540
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:47,340
terabytes there are traffic you know for

541
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:52,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Miriam traffic for user</font>

542
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:55,419
downloading those mirrors and also we

543
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:58,720
host a cool new software and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux</font>

544
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:03,400
kernel our students are basically work

545
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:07,930
our variety of products about systems

546
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:10,840
about networking and this is up the

547
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:13,060
picture for our I know student<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintain</font>

548
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,800
server room and we have you can see we

549
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:20,230
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some switches there and</font>

550
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:22,090
actually those switches are mainly

551
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,760
supporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

552
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:28,870
thesaurus and actually we don't have

553
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:32,440
much flexibility for network operation

554
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:37,199
you know testing or experiments right so

555
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually that's come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our next topic</font>

556
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,570
current we wish we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could build a</font>

557
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,969
dedicate an open net from lab so in this

558
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:49,510
lab we<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope we have you know a diverse</font>

559
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:52,630
network devices and the rutters agree we

560
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:54,850
really don't have a writer at our at our

561
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,550
lab because we are a small University

562
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:02,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's only one in our router on</font>

563
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:05,409
campers and using those resources we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

564
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:09,220
in our student Cal has a network

565
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:11,550
operations and they may have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

566
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,350
various training research opportunities

567
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:19,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">over topics like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rotting you know</font>

568
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:22,419
security measurement protocol and so on

569
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">so actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as you can see actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

570
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:30,100
will go really matched well against in

571
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:33,490
our nanog no mission to get more blood

572
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,800
in workforce into this community and

573
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:39,760
also we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very positive to be involved</font>

574
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this community as evidenced by you</font>

575
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,680
know me regularly attending this

576
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:47,050
conference and also we have so many

577
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:50,350
actually students request when I send a

for their future career and and another

593
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:45,839
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably you can do is to</font>

594
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,649
introduce new draw a job interop

595

00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">students also in addition you could</font>

597
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:58,439
assign a poor present in our career

598
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:01,109
fairs actually I'll Carson every year we

599
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,769
have three career fairs so a lot of for

600
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:07,978

602
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:15,059
this and meanwhile you could be no

603
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:18,149
provide us you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> real word product</font>

604
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:20,609
ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and that the important is you</font>

605
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:24,629
put in a follow-up or even probably

609
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:38,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that so basically you could share</font>

610
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:40,950
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data so do still have probably I</font>

Commission<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know accomplished</font>

614
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,139
right but for Earth the efforts just

615
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:51,869
getting started we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use</font>

616
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:53,908
this data so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know to research their</font>

617
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:59,039
traffic patterns to research you know

618
00:30:53,909 --> 00:31:03,749
user behaviors and also you study those

619
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:05,729
security issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know offer</font>

620
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:08,519
your traffic trees and you know writing

621
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:10,710
information you know if reduce theta a

622
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,620
little bit sensitive you know because I

623
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,289
you know

624
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:19,309
also you can do some nominalization and

625
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:21,440
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know senors right different</font>

626
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:23,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">forms and actually the potential</font>

627
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,510
outcomes of you know significant so

628
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:28,090
busily we can have insightful

629
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,408
discoveries over this dealer and

630
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,928
actually that could end up with the

631
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:36,409
master<font color="#E5E5E5"> thesis pc dissertations with you</font>

644
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:14,510
know used routers switches in a server

645
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,750
see them in a modular small to the

646
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:21,860
center in devices ups those two things

647
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:24,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">and furthermore you can offer your you</font>

test so also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing significant</font>

650
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,360
potential outcomes so we have our

651
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:38,750
students engagement and also they have

652
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,199
their liquid liquid kingdom will has our

653
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:46,309

<font color="#CCCCCC">a great favor to support you know our</font>

662
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,870
students and our research so probably

663
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,210
you can fund for example a course start

664
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:20,590
with a course for example course name

665
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:23,640
could be network operations or you can

666
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:28,000
no found the lab sessions to pay a

667
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:32,470
faculties efforts and also you know you

668
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,630
could as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the establishment established</font>

scholarships and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> a research grant</font>

to move busy get students involved so

671
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:48,820
yeah considerable outcomes so we could

672
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:51,070
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you know cutting cutting</font>

673
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:54,220
edge technology and with the new

674
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:59,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Roquefort ease to the whole nanog</font>

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:14,109
criticism to a banana you know but we we

got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of preciation to the College</font>

680
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:20,619
immersion program and then and the whole

681
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:24,219
nano community and we really benefit a

682
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:26,889
lot you know for the students hopefully

683
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:30,299
this could be a new cornerstone a

684
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:33,730
thought to initiate a more productive

685
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,530
