2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:22,539
unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last session is much more</font>

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:24,250
interactive because I'm the ITF chair

4
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:29,140
for our eye dr<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm probably one of the</font>

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:31,179
long-standing chairs in ITF and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,120
question we're having is<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP was</font>

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:48,850
developed initially to just have the

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,218
internet glue together other protocols

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,920
were failing we created<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP and BJP's</font>

mantras does it help your network work

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,910
now our last speaker gave a fairly good

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,910
tautology and all the missing all the

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,570
drafts that are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any type of formation</font>

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,509
in all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working groups the problem is</font>

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,869
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found is that may not help you</font>

20
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:15,700
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your area right and that's what this</font>

21
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:20,710

movement inside a<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter was aided</font>

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:37,990
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we created we had this whole</font>

27
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:41,770
large space for private a essence that

28
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,179
wasn't that wasn't a mistake that wasn't

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,100
something that just happened it's

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,770
something that was pre-planned because

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,860
we've come to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the data</font>

32
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:57,130
center world for bgp is much different

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:02:00,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">than the l3 VPN the l2vpn the EV p.m.</font>

34
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,780
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may want to lighten your load in</font>

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,100
the data center because it goes a whole

36
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:11,070
lot easier so one of the things we know

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:15,640
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people use in data centers and in</font>

38
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,569
networks that are have l3 VPN is flow

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,420
spec

40
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,339
and recently we had a whole bunch of

41
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,920
people about 10 different drafts that

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,450
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and said hi I want to add to</font>

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,909
flow spec for blank and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

44
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">through that and then asking people to</font>

00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:39,450
tell me is this necessary why is that

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:44,679
important for the eye dr chair to hear

things in IDR go a little bit slower

67
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,918
because what I've been told by a lot of

68

operators is please make sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:02,130
I've shortened the tech portion of my

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> again soon so we just heard about</font>

100
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,210
how bgp could become really the api for

101
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,860
networks of you know for many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

102
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,789
things there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of additional</font>

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">information you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might like to put into</font>

104
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,930
bgp and communities are kind of

105
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,039
overloaded with all different kinds of

106
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,220
fields from a service provider

107
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,830
perspective are there efforts underway

108
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,260
to come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a maybe more extensible</font>

109
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,780
way to encode sort of generic

110
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,310
information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to send</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">along with my router advertisements sure</font>

112
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,690
route it<font color="#CCCCCC"> depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the type of</font>

113
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,479
information so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to dig down in</font>

114
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,490
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that answer usable for you</font>

115
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,590
you have to dig down later if it's a

116
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,140
flow space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go through some of this</font>

117
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,060
if it's I want to color my route which

118
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,120
is what all communities are is coloring

119
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,830
the route for some reason tell me what

120
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,630
you want to color the routers and yes

121
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,210
there's a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

122
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,390
can do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fashion or we can make it</font>

123
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,989
simple and register more communities

124
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:24,090
initially people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said we don't want</font>

125
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,860
registration on communities best puts in

126
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,489
a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different stuff into</font>

communities if you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> it simplified I</font>

128
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,710
just need more detail I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to list</font>

129
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,440
all my routes I'm sorry all<font color="#CCCCCC"> my peers and</font>

130
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,969
the utilization

131
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,830
of the peering connections so they're

132
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,310
gonna come afterwards and talk that so i

133
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:48,140
make sure i get my talk but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i</font>

134
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,720
know what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want but i need some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">through what 5575 is RFC 55 it was</font>

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:23,810
those droughts drafts that went from

145
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:26,059
draft to RFC fairly quickly and now that

146
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,860
we're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second set of denial of</font>

147
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,380
service attacks we've found in some

148
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,080
interoperability tests and fixes so

149
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,300
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix it that's why</font>

150
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,940
we're revising it and people have asked

151
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,970
for some additions that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel are</font>

152
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,450
use that are critical I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

153
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,610
that and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've got a rev 5575</font>

154
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:49,430
because if there are interoperability

155
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,100
bugs that's my bottom line I don't want

156
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">your code to hit a router vendor or an</font>

157
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,000
open source when they won't hope

158
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,350
interoperate because sooner or later it

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,380
will break a network<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so that's why</font>

160
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,950
you revise it be gb version 2 is for the

161
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:11,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">SDN approach because you require</font>

162
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:15,740
ordering bgp flow spec version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 has a</font>

163
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,650
fixed order you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's defined in the spec</font>

164
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,890
and your filters go<font color="#E5E5E5"> one two three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

165
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:26,299
so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter something</font>

166
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:30,260
that's not a prefix first it will you'll

167
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:36,140
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have on any caste or star prefix</font>

168
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:39,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're working on ok so that's the</font>

169
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,409
talk let me go through it in detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

170
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:45,530
so what does 5575 look like you have an

171
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:49,150
affy you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> safi everybody and a fee</font>

172
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,150
is an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> family identifier</font>

173
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:56,660
and a safy is a sub address<font color="#E5E5E5"> of identify</font>

174
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,939
mostly done for VPNs or sometimes for

175
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,399
multicast you have a lengthy of the next

176
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:03,980
top and you have all the fill in and you

177
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,100
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an unreached that looks the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

178
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,350
looks cool but we've adopted some other

179
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,860
things in order to handle EVP n which is

180
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">a l2vpn which is 25 and we've had the</font>

181
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Saffy's that say it's either a vb a VPN</font>

182
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:23,089
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp VPN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok bpn being a regular IP</font>

183
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:27,310
setup now how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the</font>

184
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">storage of rules ok a storage of rules</font>

185
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:34,910
occurs when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you basically have a flow</font>

186
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:38,750
spec rules list and you have matched

187
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:41,930
filters which is what a majority of 5575

188
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:46,939
has and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have actions and the actions</font>

189
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,709
are fairly simple I didn't create<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

190
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:50,750
third<font color="#E5E5E5"> action because I assume people</font>

191
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:53,388
would realize the first action is drop

192
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,649
it but you can also modify and forward

193
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:59,149
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so that's the basic symptoms</font>

194
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,550
and by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to the</font>

195
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,100
gentleman who<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked about odl and other</font>

196
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,219
things some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the policy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work coming</font>

197
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,050
out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp yang model and some of</font>

198
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,120
the other pieces are trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

199
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,599
give you control of some of the filters

200
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp yang r2s filter based rib are all</font>

201
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,970
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you do this through net</font>

202
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:23,149
comp as well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp provides instead</font>

203
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,759
is BG provides the thing it did inversed

204
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:29,360
was his here's a quick let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

205
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,699
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everybody ok it's a distribution</font>

206
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp as a distribution for these filters</font>

207
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:36,378
is extremely effective if what you're

208
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:38,600
trying to do is get it to all the bgp

209
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:42,769
peers and from that to whatever place

210
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,490
your router lets you put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok problems</font>

211
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,899
let me go deeper problems there's a

212
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,180
specification written by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys who</font>

213
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,430
did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting draft level</font>

214
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,439
bachelor IDR flows<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect clarification</font>

215
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,479
which is being adopted as a working

216
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:59,480
group theft it's just simply being

217
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,990
adopted because we need to know is this

218
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,750
all the problems someone is found in

219
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,790
testing if somehow you've tested your

220
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,220
flow spec because that was your thing

221
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,709
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to use and you found some</font>

222
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,370
bugs either send a note to the eye dr

223
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:16,959
list or send it to these authors<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if</font>

224
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,959
nothing else send it to me we're trying

225
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:24,540
to to make sure if something's unclear

226
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:27,219
it's fixed there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two conflicting</font>

227
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,959
prospective actions from things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

228
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,649
idea working group has said that was

229
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:36,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful it's either an IV redirect or</font>

230
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:39,459
path redirect to tunnels now our

231
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,190
question for today is do you need to

232
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,959
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second one in a revision we've</font>

233
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,500
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the first one so if we're</font>

234
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:50,920
going to revise the spec do you need to

235
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:54,250
have IP direct and path redirect in the

236
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,140
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> v1 if that's true then we'll put it</font>

237
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">in v1 and we'll ship it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll we'll</font>

238
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,120
run this through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> standardization</font>

239
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:04,149
fairly quickly bgp standardization a bit

240
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,750
odd in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect you the</font>

241
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:11,320
operators the user of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp the eye dr</font>

242
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:15,010
co-chairs are unique because we come

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,950
from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time of working in vendors</font>

244
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,200
or working with code and we require two

245
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,540
implementations we need to know that

246
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,940
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship bgp in these fashions</font>

247
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,569
where it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone to an RFC we</font>

248
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,430
have a fairly good understanding now

249
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,620
your vendor still is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your source but</font>

250
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,520
we're trying to help what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can in</font>

251
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,800
standards now there is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> upgrade for</font>

252
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,199
security called draft IDR flow spec

253
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,199
which loosens some of the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

254
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP the security in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP flow spec is</font>

255
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,180
basically can we detect it came from the

256
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">right place there's no track there's no</font>

257
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:56,140
ID it's pretty much we better trust your

258
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp infrastructure to give you the right</font>

259
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,730
stuff and that no one's going to stuff

260
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,160
in a flow spec that's going to cause you

261
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> blackhole traffic for your customers</font>

262
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,390
but if it came from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same loving peer</font>

263
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,660
that sent you the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the routes</font>

264
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:15,010
will accept a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP flow spec if that</font>

265
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,079
gives you pause

266
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,330
to me this this talk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

267
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,330
lot of and come talk to me if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

268
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:25,150
really a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's talk about</font>

269
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,370
new actions there's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set of</font>

270
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:31,540
new actions we've adopted because some

271
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:36,400
people want to right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

272
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:39,010
action to filter by bitrate you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

273
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,939
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy can go ahead but only by so</font>

274
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:44,620
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes that's the traffic bitrate</font>

275
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,650
some people have said well I no longer

276
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,130
count bites I want to count packets give

277
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:55,590
me a packet filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how important is</font>

278
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:58,150
it do you have a bitrate translation

279
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,460
then there's a traffic action which

280
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,530
really talks about mirroring your ports

281
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,490
so if you're getting denial of service

282
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:10,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you have one of the boxes that does</font>

283
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:12,940
denial of service processing there's a

284
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,439
flag that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says turn on the hardware bit</font>

285
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,510
that's going to mirror the stuff out of

286
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">port ok cool the redirect is redirect to</font>

287
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:26,350
a VPN and the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a redirect to</font>

288
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,910
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tunnel it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even on this list we</font>

289
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">have excuse me it's down there on the</font>

290
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,910
path redirect so the IP redirect is

291
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:36,550
redirected to this IP address and VPN

292
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:40,959
and the path redirect which is farther

293
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:44,199
down is actually we directed to this

294
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,840
tunnel or sequence<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what's left</font>

295
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,020
there there's an MPLS push and pop in

296
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,520
case you want to instruct the traffic

297
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you've been received to be pushed</font>

298
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,290
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mpls tunnel that assumes that</font>

299
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,510
you're actually running mpls in there

300
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,089
and that's useful and then there's an

301
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,950
inner interface grouping and this came

302
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:07,000
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> France Telecom so I will quote</font>

303
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:09,070
the source basically they said okay flow

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,440
specs really nice but for these

305
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,240
interfaces we want to run flow spec plus

306
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles because we have something</font>

307
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,380
else we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in there we want to</font>

308
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,270
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flow specs so we clean it up</font>

309
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,010
but then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to run the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles</font>

310
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:24,120
afterward because we did something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

311
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:27,689
the apples to help this client<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

312
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,690
that's the

313
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:35,240
basic idea now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go through a few of</font>

314
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,960
the new filters the new filters that

315
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,610
have come on have been for ipv6 flow ID

316
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,990
which if you listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of the</font>

317
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,970
people from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center yesterday</font>

318
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,470
you will realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're using</font>

319
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IB I v6 flow ID and next</font>

320
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,810
hop arms this does the flow ID filtering

321
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,540
if you need it next hop filtering do

322
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,760
tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a data center there's</font>

323
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,040
a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of stuff for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> envio 3 which</font>

324
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">is basically things that look a whole</font>

325
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,680
lot like GRE and VL VX land where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

326
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,160
might want to look at your virtual

327
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,500
network ID filter on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then</font>

328
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,050
there's the label filters I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

329
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,910
filter on packets coming in with an NPS

330
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:22,729
label and some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> exp beads ok so</font>

331
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,310
these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new filters ok these have</font>

332
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,890
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted as working group drafts</font>

333
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,109
meaning we found enough interest that we

334
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,840
think it's worth continuing to work on

335
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:39,920
it the real question will be is it

336
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:44,090
enough that we can go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that</font>

337
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:47,030
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow spec v 1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will pause here in</font>

338
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:49,730
case their questions I'll take the I

339
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:56,890
hate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> later but if you have a question</font>

340
00:16:49,730 --> 00:17:01,790
asked me now about the content ok cool f

341
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:03,980
is first of all talking with the eye dr

342
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,099
chair who's been at this a while maybe

343
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,650
like drinking at a fire hose am I at the

344
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:17,540
fire hose level for you guys please

345
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:20,000
admit it because I'll slow down ok so

346
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,250
the best way after I fire hose do is to

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,099
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions if you don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

348
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:30,380
questions are to ask I'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deep</font>

349
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:33,050
breath and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to go slower but please</font>

350
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,360
let me know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with if</font>

351
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,800
you're shy to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions in public</font>

352
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:44,909
don't worry come see me later

353
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so why flow spec fee to my previous</font>

354
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:52,320
author put the road put up a note from

355
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:56,909
James you Taran James<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jotaro is AT&T and</font>

356
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,669
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some advanced work so guitar</font>

357
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh and other people are looking at sdn</font>

358
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:06,210
is a way to do various new features

359
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,909
maybe new security maybe new management

360
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,270
and control of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their network but we're</font>

361
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:14,970
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v2 push from people who</font>

362
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:21,420
really want to use NFV and Sen to

363
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:23,100
control pathways so they would like to

364
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:28,250
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of one of the two things you</font>

365
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:30,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">must have for 5575</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or 5575 bits for v1</font>

366
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,060
they would like to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of the fixed</font>

367
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,760
order they would like to test mpls first

368
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,879
or or one of the other bites first and

369
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,570
then have the four destinations not

370
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:46,560
tested at all they would like it set by

371
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:48,510
them great idea if two people want to

372
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,820
set the order because that works well

373
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:57,810
for them great and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

374
00:18:50,820 --> 00:19:03,179
defaults as the current v1 spec ok so in

375
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:05,370
that we offer this off of the wide

376
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,980
communities once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get the large</font>

377
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,139
communities resettled by the what's the

378
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,940
difference did anyone ever want to ask

379
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,950
me what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference between a wide</font>

380
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,160
community and large community does

381
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:21,050
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to pop up with the answer</font>

382
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok well two bites is the short answer</font>

383
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:30,530
the long answer is it's we<font color="#CCCCCC"> standardized</font>

384
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:34,230
for bite a SS how many use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> by TS is</font>

385
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:37,980
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so the problem with four byte</font>

386
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">is is is we didn't really we put white</font>

387
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,950
communities in in order to be able to

388
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,860
have four by deuses do the same things

389
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,679
communities are doing now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

390
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,110
ah but why communities we added some

391
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,720
things in order to let some other things

392
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,209
people had come in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> operators in</font>

393
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,360
September said we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want the simple</font>

394
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,700
form just give us you know for an

395
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:07,020
expansion of communities 24 bytes in

396
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,910
other words supersize me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay out</font>

397
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,230
because our vendors say they can

398
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get that through and</font>

399
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,600
implemented and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> quagga and we</font>

400
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,990
have open<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp and all of those guys are</font>

401
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,860
really to do the very simple case<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

402
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:25,679
fine so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference the white</font>

403
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,280
communities allowed some<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition for</font>

404
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:34,410
these new features differences about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

405
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:36,330
bytes so that you could have some

406
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:40,650
filters on your a s and some other

407
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:43,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">features which with order ok so this</font>

408
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,110
flow spec v 2 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still in that range we</font>

409
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:49,740
may as far as we know we're continuing

410
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:54,918
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> white communities but it's a tell</font>

411
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:58,260
us what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want process so what's in it</font>

412
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,669
we have ordering where we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

413
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,500
both the unreachable and unreachable

414
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:04,470
with an order which means instead of

415
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,090
having to specify v4 and then all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

416
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,030
other things you just tell us what order

417
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,120
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell us the bites again what's</font>

418
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:14,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference two or three bites and</font>

419
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> true with unreachable now</font>

420
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,710
what do thee and then you have new new

421
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:22,890
actions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i specified and we could</font>

422
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,590
add more fairly flexibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll add the</font>

423
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,750
new security there there have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

424
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,360
proposals to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional security if</font>

425
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,890
that's important stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font>

426
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,479
something and now to my question real

427
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:41,520
question slide where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

428
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,559
stand here and listen first let me start

429
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,950
with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question how many</font>

430
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:50,399
providers here use bgp flows but for

431
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:52,080
denial of service okay so this is a

432
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,210
crowd where this may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

433
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:59,379
useful as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

434
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:02,230
you can probably take for anything that

435
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">has bgp flow second this bgp flow spec</font>

436

is making its way to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source fairly</font>

437
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:15,309
quickly and you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to distribute</font>

438
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:17,289
your filters<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it if</font>

439
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,418
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using it this is probably the</font>

440
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:20,980
wrong audience so we'll take other

441
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,440
questions anything else you'd like to

442
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:28,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask about bgp how much time do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

445
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,710
some background but maybe the guys

upstairs are doing background with all

with some vendors only having recently

added it and some vendors only having

filtering actions for what rats we

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:53,200
accept via flow spec aren't there

471
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:56,500
they're not implemented so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

472
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">a way to securely receive that</font>

473
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,360
information from our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers so what</font>

474
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,809
do you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by not implemented can you</font>

475
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,469
give me an exam so the

476
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:11,049
path validation is critical and fairly

477
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:14,580
basic in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they can only</font>

478
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:17,908
actually announce their own routes yep

479
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:22,779
the bigger problem is filtering actions

480
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:26,019
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a way on my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> platform</font>

481
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:28,870
with my vendor at least to prevent my

482
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:34,389
customer from changing their next hop to

483
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:37,840
a different birth<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's that sort of</font>

484
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:39,998
thing that is stopping I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you're</font>

485
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,860
at a very basic policy engine level

486
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:44,649
where they're not implementing enough to

487
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:47,049
support it right sorry that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Gold</font>

00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:51,158
Beach offender up<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not a standard</font>

489
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:53,200
moment we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying in another hat I'm</font>

490
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs chair and I'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

491
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,090
netconf gang models to do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

492
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,129
don't see if the guys don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a basic</font>

493
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,259
functionality in their own CLI that they

494
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:03,850
did any of the other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> which makes</font>

495
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:07,499
it easy to get to is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help you</font>

496
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:11,289
at all it's basically beach event drop

497
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:14,409
sorry i I'm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendor community so</font>

498
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:17,580
beating up vendors usually means some

499
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:22,749
your account team needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to your</font>

500
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:26,710
development team so go ahead hi my name

501
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:30,039
is 80 my work in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP I haven't been</font>

502
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:34,179
to IDF in a while but we tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

503
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:37,299
bbbj flow spec t4d das mitigation about

504
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:39,759
a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago okay and yes I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

505
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:43,389
real important question dead why are

506
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:46,690
most operators not using it to do DDoS

507
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:49,469
mitigation and just as the gentleman<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

508
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,460
me said when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing a testing</font>

509
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,179
battle year ago some of the

510
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,149
implementations were still very young

511
00:25:54,179 --> 00:26:00,369
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's really the first</font>

512
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:03,969
revisions it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the routers but</font>

513
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:07,178
also we're using you know Flo collectors

514
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,039
and then my flow collector can do b2b

515
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">flows back but when I started testing it</font>

516
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,789
there were so many bugs that

517
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,789
can I tell if I yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> go forward with this</font>

518
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:20,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and besides we're doing multi vendors</font>

519
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:24,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside the network and the log outputs</font>

520
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,019
from the routers differ so much from

521
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,659
vendor to vendor that it was totally not

522
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:31,250
possible to send message to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a knock that</font>

523
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:34,429
this is what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> another network</font>

524
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,700
right now so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of</font>

525
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:42,019
more cleaning up on the implementations

526
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,210
to do and maybe a standardization can

527
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:46,490
help out in that way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

528
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,769
log outs puts you know where we

529
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:51,409
recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it be written in certain</font>

530
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:53,600
way you know not differ totally from

531
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,889
vendor to vendor mm-hmm I mean the

532
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,000
features are great she's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great</font>

533
00:26:54,889 --> 00:27:01,939
but when we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to implement it</font>

534
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,889
and start operated its you have to get

535
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,490
their permission down to more people who

536
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:09,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not really bright on bgp technology</font>

537
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,350
do you want to know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

538
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:14,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think that's one of the things that</font>

539
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,570
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be added on so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what you use to</font>

540
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,399
pull it out was either a collector to

541
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:22,700
say what sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information is in the</font>

542
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:24,649
bgp or did you just scrape logs and pull

543
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">it out possessed yeah that's a really</font>

544
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:29,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">good question so what we first start</font>

545
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:32,480
wanted to do was to detect using needles

546
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:34,940
using BB<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside flow collectors and</font>

547
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,799
used to flow collectors to push beach

548
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,010
beautiful aspect messages to the network

549
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,139
and when it worked we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routers</font>

550
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,559
to send back information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

551
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:47,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">working and though it's working was ok</font>

552
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:53,418
well just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to kind of you know</font>

553
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:56,889
reparse the logs first but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

554
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:59,179
difficult to get readable of some some

555
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:01,070
implementations back then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was this is</font>

556
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,080
probably the young implementation

557
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:06,200
problem did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> logs</font>

558
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:10,370
coming out it would be really good for

559
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">me my co-chair and if i'll give you my</font>

560
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:14,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">card afterwards or even go on idea if</font>

561
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,668
you'd write up the province you have

562
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:19,010
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through some key</font>

563
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,680
vendors and tell them I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> respected</font>

564
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,230
I

565
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,670
document did this year ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i'm</font>

566
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,830
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure things are much more</font>

567
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:29,310
different in the pasture there's been

568
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,710
advancements and the implementation so

569
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,960
what I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing is trying</font>

570
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,240
to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a partner my thinking about</font>

571
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,820
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> netherlandish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will do</font>

572
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,670
the same test again and CD that thinks

573
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:45,210
of improving if not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bringing about a</font>

574
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,700
thing in this to the idea also so I will

575
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:52,080
provide more feedback that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

576
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,470
useful because in the yang models which

577
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,500
is what everybody points<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next gen</font>

578
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">I personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> written flow spec models</font>

579
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,700
that work across bgp and installing

580
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,190
policy based routing and just

581
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,850
configuring policy based routing in

582
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:15,120
various things because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you've area</font>

583
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:18,209
tested it your exact problem is really

584
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,370
important to know and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had hoped that</font>

585
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,580
that would help the OTL collectors which

586
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:25,770
most of you know about OTL<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the fact</font>

587
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,199
that the collectors of topology has been

588
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,530
fairly useful there we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping to put</font>

589
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,920
some like that into an OT l or an old

590
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:38,129
OPN FB yeah if I've got the name right I

591
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,650
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it backwards but they're an</font>

592
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">open source implementation for both the</font>

593
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,060
collector<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for like an open source</font>

594
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">demon like quagga which is where I'm</font>

595
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,040
putting the other portion of it that's a

596
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,840
really i thought that would be a good

597
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,389
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you guys to play and tell us</font>

598

more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy thank you</font>

599
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:01,610

600
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:05,540
send out notes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get used to the</font>

601
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:10,169
topology collector<font color="#E5E5E5"> row it where are you</font>

602
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:13,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">did he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wander off did the did the OTL</font>

603
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:18,800
stuff you're referring to come up with

604
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:22,230
bgp off the collector or BBMP bippy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

605
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,540
their plans was too i'm working with the

of these streams email this morning

610
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:41,729
about the BMP and BP flow Specter

611
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:43,109
implementations on dinner yeah we're

612
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:47,340
hoping that'll come out and help people

613

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least start to play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it but as</font>

614
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,779
far as I know the actual gang models

615
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,989
they've only done the basic BMP and not

616
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:56,429
down to if the if the flow suspect came

617
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:59,840
out that's great because that was on

618
00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:06,229
their path so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good help</font>

one other question since I'm finished

621
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:14,159
with my flow spec is there any bgp

622
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:21,799
feature that is causing you trouble or

623
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:25,559
that you need how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are are</font>

624
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:27,090
running bgp in their network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm</font>

625
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:30,269
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought maybe you guys were</font>

we had a wake-up call in September when

630

people said we've told you for five

631
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,330
