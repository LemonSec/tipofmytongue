definitely where the industry is going

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,130
it's not always go always in fiber to

the home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that but</font>

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,170
definitely there's bed with pressure and

30
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,479
fiber is there to stay in to face the

industry people adopt that because

65
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,970
there's a big bandwidth push and

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,549
increase requirement one thing is

67
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:35,200
interesting to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> also and</font>

68
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:36,459
that's this portion here probably that

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys will not be surprised about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all surprised or impressed we see as I</font>

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,989
said the big push for bandwidth

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:57,190
requirement cisco vni tells us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

worldwide is the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bandwidth</font>

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,060
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running everywhere on the</font>

81
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,340
this volume will double in the next

three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years to pretty much 10.4</font>

satellite but the most important thing

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand is that this traffic is</font>

85
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,270
seventy-five percent or seventy-three

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,960
percent confined inside the data center

87
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's rack to Rack transmission the fader</font>

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,930
like you put on facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to promote</font>

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,800
this only<font color="#E5E5E5"> service but before people see</font>

90
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,199
that on their page on there or

91
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're feed it just update all your</font>

92
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,970
friends pages and that's a lot of

93
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:49,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic that stays inside the data</font>

94
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,979
center so this amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

95
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,800
seventy-two percent seventy-three

96
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:59,060
percent sorry within the data center ten

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,889
percent only<font color="#E5E5E5"> DCI between the data center</font>

98
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a little bit less than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty</font>

99
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:07,280
percent that goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DC user so</font>

100
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,430
that's definitely where will we see or

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,849
where are we seeing today more bandwidth

102
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,659
pressure inside the data center

103
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:21,050
definitely so 100 gig or migration from

104
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:24,050
10 gig to 100 gig will be a very big

105

topics of discussion and activity in the

140
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,090
is that you have LC connector on the

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,030
transceiver and you do transmit and

142

receive over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber and if you</font>

not to tell you where or educate you

154
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,570
about the leaf spine because I know that

I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody knows in the</font>

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,490
audience what it is but I just reinforce

157
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:14,190
the point that you see a bunch of black

158
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:17,669
box with patch panel that makes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

159
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,750
connectors that can be manipulated and

160
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:25,219
when you manipulate a connector it's

161
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:27,860
basic it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> contaminated</font>

162
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:30,960
contamination and connector it's

163
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,020
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our source ninety to</font>

164
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,588
ninety-five percent of the issues you

165
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,939
will find on<font color="#CCCCCC"> fibre optic infrastructure</font>

166
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:41,719
because most of the time people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

167
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,060
have the proper equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inspect or</font>

168
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,670
clean but most importantly they don't

169
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,739
have necessarily the right training to

170
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,089
know that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of damage if</font>

171
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:56,250
they take the connector and they just

172
00:08:53,089 --> 00:09:00,270
gently sweep it on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> finger oil</font>

173
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:03,000
contamination is a very big issue in

174
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,400

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,180

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,910
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use a new LTS you need two</font>

LTS to unit can do bidirectional and

224
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:43,270
this one will give you the total

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:08,560
and the signal that comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back comes</font>

232
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:12,910
back because of impurities on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber</font>

233
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,250
or bad connection somewhere a bad

create a big reflectance minus 30 DB of

238
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,660
the OTDR and if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure</font>

properly the first connection in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

243
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,710
proper methodology to characterize the

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,170
input and output connector if you read

245
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,820
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just want to troubleshoot and you</font>

246
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,420
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to know where the brake</font>

247
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,550
can be on the fiber and not get the real

248
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,550
precise measurement of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entry and</font>

249
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,920
output connector you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can plug</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

250
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,829
short fiber there right there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

251
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,680
will get the break if there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a break</font>

252
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:11,260
somewhere but if you care to measure the

253
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,079
connection there you need to use this

254
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,200
launch and receive ok so the fame to

255
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:21,940
glory of the OTDR is that it can map the

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,880
issue and one best example is what is my

257
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">river what is the back reflection at</font>

258
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,030
this patch panel that n in

259
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:35,020
set of going at this which it can go out

260
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:39,430
of the data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a too</font>

261
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:42,819
much big back reflection there an EDF a

262
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:46,689
can stop working automatic power

263
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:50,020
reduction mode drop the power for safety

264
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:54,010
reason if this by example back

265
00:13:50,020 --> 00:14:02,290
reflection is worse that then minus 30

266
00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:06,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">DB okay so here what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> present is a</font>

267
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:10,300
night still take the sleeve spine

268
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,330
example in this example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue let's</font>

269
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:16,420
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection you see on top can be</font>

270
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:19,660
copper so fiber begins at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the leaf</font>

271
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:22,089
switch the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge switch to the core</font>

272
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:26,230
switch where you see spine in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

273
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:29,320
so this use case represent something

274
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,230
very typical that people needs to do in

275
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:36,300
data center move add and change of

276
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:40,780
transceiver if you change one thousand

277
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:44,050
port of leaf switch and spine switch in

278
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:48,069
a migration to 100 gig or 40 gig have a

279
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:52,349
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> transceiver turns all you will</font>

280
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:56,790
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some issue at a certain statistical</font>

281
00:14:52,350 --> 00:15:00,250
percentage inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spool of</font>

282
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:04,170
transceiver so the best way to let's say

283
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:08,260
achieve this migration effectively is to

284
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:10,180
get a method of procedure the method of

285
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,610
procedure that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend it's quite</font>

286
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,170
clear and simple if you touch a

287
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,880
connector and you disconnect something

288
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:21,430
inspect with the probe<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then you</font>

289
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,920
will get a pass or fail on the

290
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,839
instrument or on the interface because

291
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,270
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you manipulate you can</font>

292
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,830
contaminate keep that in mind train<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

293
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:36,460
people to do that and before to inspect

294
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:39,980
you disconnect but you test the old link

295
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,080
with a no LTS you don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ish</font>

296
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,060
you you just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to validate that this</font>

297
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,670
permanent link or this channel link

298
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,189
without the patch cord is good and in

299
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget and you do that for one</font>

300
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,350
reason and you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that very</font>

301
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,750
quickly and that's why the ults is the

302
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,470
best technology because it tests that

303
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:03,290
link in three<font color="#E5E5E5"> second two wavelengths the</font>

304
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,540
use of two wavelengths will help you to

305
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,020
diagnose if you have a macro<font color="#E5E5E5"> band for</font>

306
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance and it will validate the budget</font>

307
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,329
once the permanent link is clear and you

308
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,790
know it's good then you move your

309
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,800
transceiver and if you have an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

310
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:22,010
the transceiver you don't ask yourself

311
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,260
if is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fiber or a transceiver the</font>

312
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,300
fiber has just been validated that's

313
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:30,700
this kind of method of procedure that is

314
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:36,770
that saves at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end a lot of time okay</font>

315
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:40,010
so that's another use case in this use

316
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:42,350
case it's more at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> construction when</font>

317
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,880
you construct these permanent link and

318
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,010
you want to follow the standard

319
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,360

more complex than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one basic link</font>

328

you have more chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have issue that</font>

329
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:24,770
you cannot map so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use</font>

the LTS if you follow the standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

332
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:33,260
link LTS is good otdr is good also

333
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:35,570
because you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test the permanent</font>

the launch and receive as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said but</font>

336
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:44,720
what we promote more and more is if you

map default each and every connection

341
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:59,990
you can let's say take your receive

387
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,100
problem if you begin to bring that to

388
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,780
the to the MP to the transceiver and you

389
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,990
do a lot of move at and change of

will have issue you will begin to see

393
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,850
reflectance issue and one of the big

course you see here a nice 24 fiber a

multimode connector these connector

408
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:47,830
needs to be inspected of course the

409
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,840
industry came out with tip on the probes

410
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,330
of different vendor that can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that job</font>

411
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,820
and you can inspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> each and every fiber</font>

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:22,990
can be inspected such as single LC with

425
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,710
this is another test consideration that

before to connect these components you

436
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,890
need to validate the pin out or the

it and after the installation to make

sure that any fiber has been kinked or

464
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,260

499

reflection a little bit earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

500
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:47,530
scenario of migrating from 10 gig to 100

501
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:49,660
gig that is an issue that we see since a

502
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:54,370
couple of years with people that have

503
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">started to deploy 100 gig coherent then</font>

504
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:00,100
and that's let's say what we continue to

505
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:04,360
see with those who start the

506
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:09,969
installation of the first shipping if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

507
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:14,169
can say of the PSM for on 500 meter in

508
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:15,790
single mode what I present ear is the

509
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:20,380
result of an application note that we

510
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:27,790
did the reference is there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

511
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:31,110
will explain we did 19 connection mating

512
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:37,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of connectors okay for each connection</font>

513
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:40,240
we took<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sample of data for each</font>

514
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect EULA each of the 19 connection</font>

515
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:47,800
the sample of data were contamination at

516
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:52,750
different wavelengths so clean connector

517
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:55,899
at 1310 clean connector at 1550 dirty

518
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:59,080
connector with finger oil after it in 10

519
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:03,040
and dirty connector at 1550 and we

520
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:08,290
measure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> insertion loss which is a</font>

521
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:10,450
very popular parameter for qualifying

the quality of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> installation of fiber</font>

523
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:18,520
infrastructure what we see is a strict

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:20,800
correlation for each connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

525
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,070
each connection are created equal but

526
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,169
not are not created equal sorry so each

527
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:30,129
connection can vary from point to point

528
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:32,200
15 2.6 of course everybody understand

529
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each connection we have a</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strict correlation for the four</font>

531
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:43,740

532
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,439
see presenting different insertion loss

533
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,879

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:55,549
current connection 19 sample 19 item

535
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:58,158
like this normal what is happening if we

536
00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:02,980
look instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of looking at insertion</font>

537
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:06,860
loss if we look at Richard loss or

538
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:09,250
reflectance that's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and as</font>

539
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,789
I said before reflectance is more

540
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:16,220
important if you deal with higher

543
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:26,600
namely and it will not be different in

00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:31,189
400 day the same 19 connection the same

00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:50,220
people are strategically mapping the

reduce the distance to you to their main

624
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:01,470
market why because fiber itself induce

latency if you run over hundreds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

trailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so latency is a big issue</font>

637
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,319
you need to control that you need to

638
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:43,230
measure that and you need to solve

things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to make sure</font>

644
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,220
if you deal with your data center

interconnect that the physical layer

646
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:02,009
itself doesn't bring any issue okay so

647
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,130
you need to especially when you rent

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the city industry came up</font>

a test stream that you're monitoring and

everything generated by a virtual probe

772
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:59,160
or a base or hardware based probe inside

773
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,259
your network so

774
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,730
accumulating data with passive probe is

775
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:10,640
interesting but simulating traffic and

776
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:12,870
doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same measuring the performance</font>

people complain you can reproduce this

781
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,770
kind of behavior in some portion of your

00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a better visibility</font>

783
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:33,660
so that's pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for me two</font>
