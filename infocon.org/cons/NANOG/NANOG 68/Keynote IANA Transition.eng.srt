1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,620
okay yes I guess it is well<font color="#E5E5E5"> good morning</font>

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not one of the talks that have</font>

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,900
been vetted by the

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,599
by the program committee so this is my

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,630
fault whatever you like or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not my like</font>

6
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:24,520
about it it's my fault don't blame them

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,410
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ayana I</font>

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,650
was asked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about transition the</font>

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,970
transition but I decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,579
everybody in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going to know</font>

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,040
what what how this thing started what

12
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's when its heritage was where it's</font>

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,059
going and things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font>

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,059
I'd start back at the beginning and just

15
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:45,998
a note on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> retiring from</font>

16
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:48,399
Harvard my last day<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the last day of</font>

17
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:50,379
this month and I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on vacation</font>

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,620
since July first so it won't be that

19
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:56,199
much of a change but as of as of

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,909
November first my Harvard email address

21
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,289
may or may not work<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see whether</font>

22
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:03,640
whether they're going to continue it or

23
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:06,250
not so this whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing started what</font>

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,970
became the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ayana started with a network</font>

25
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,770
working group 1968 this was an ad hoc

26

group Steve Crocker and a few other

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:19,030
folks put together a group to talk about

28
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:22,119
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to progress standards progress</font>

31
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:28,420

38
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,890
it was the network working group itself

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:53,710
disappeared within a few years then RC

48
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,660
selection of them it was just somebody

49

got the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in sequence the iono</font>

name showed up in 1988 it was a long

51
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,049
time later that the iono name itself

52
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,960
showed up

53
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,660
with Joyce Reynolds listed as the ionic

contractor was more than sockets in 77

56
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,530
we started getting IP Internet Protocol

<font color="#E5E5E5">and some parameters for that the IP</font>

issue there with IP addresses you didn't

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,530
want to use IP addresses because it was

61
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,420
too easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mess them up so Paul market</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Petrus and others came up with a domain</font>

the NSF and from itu and others like

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,490
that so he sent off a note saying a

232
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,109
point of representative and that meant

233
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if they did that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they would be</font>

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,339
there so they were paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention we</font>

290

had to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the Aaron had to be</font>

291
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:01,670
formed with government approval because

292
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:06,560
this was still a government contract and

293
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:10,130
so Aaron was spun off in 97 then later

294
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,069
in night he said July first 97 Vice

government should recognize the

government's plural should recognize the

something real now it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a toy</font>

private sector a lot of comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

319
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:20,980
meanwhile John being urged on by the

term he used was institutionalized in

323

326
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:40,790
just a general idea of what he<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font>

327
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:44,220
I really pretty well filled out a plan

328
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:47,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">came to a head sort of at the conference</font>

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,660
Magaziner was there to force for shadow

332
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:58,889
what the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> government was planning</font>

333
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:03,749
which turned out to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the green paper</font>

334
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the white paper so he was saying for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">inform a private company to do this</font>

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">french folks there at the meeting why</font>

340
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,899
not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> give it to the ITU it's right</font>

341
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,170
up the street they know they know this

342
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,089
stuff that's their business and

343
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,670
magazines answer was political and long

344
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:31,399
but it boiled down to governments can't

345
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,660
food move as fast as the internet and

346
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,629
therefore it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense to do</font>

347
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,719
that John<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't make it to that</font>

348
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:43,319
meeting later on if I know why but at

349
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:47,189
the time didn't know so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented in</font>

356
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,979
it's on my website it presents John's

357
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,589
original idea of what the

different details that what became<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

during<font color="#E5E5E5"> that conference the US government</font>

362
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,339
discovered that John had redirected the

363
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:22,020
route I was a little exciting IRA

364
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,958
Magaziner pulled me into a corner and

365
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,839
yelled at me for a while because he saw

366
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,520
me as a path to John and he yelled

367
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,020
literally yelled at me and then he

368
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,490
quieted down when he saw Gordon Cooke

369
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,899
hanging around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a background trying to</font>

370
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:40,529
figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on and but he</font>

371
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:43,620
got message is very clear John he felt

372
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:47,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that John was endangering an effort to</font>

373
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:50,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">to privatize the I Anna functions</font>

374
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,370
and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was seen as taking it</font>

375
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,049
over and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new Serbian government</font>

376
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,239
responsibility that wouldn't sit well on

00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,889

378

hill and other places<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the government</font>

379
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:06,320
so the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> got through and John</font>

380
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:10,049
ended his experiment a few days<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

381
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,970

particularly magazine and Department<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

and it was basically very informed by

390
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,639
what John had in mind of what an iono

00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,668
thought it'd need to be

we don't like the Department of Commerce

450
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,770
believing they can tell the IETF which

451
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,660
is a private organization where it must

452
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,720
get its protocol parameters registered

453
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:22,010
and they said well we can't not do it

454
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's a contract with ISI and we</font>

one word in the contract we might have

458
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:34,159
to rebid it then telcordia could get it

459
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:35,720
and then then the world would end the

460
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,260
internet would no longer be what it was

461

00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,290
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> inherently wrong with that not</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have read them all I would doubt</font>

627
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:09,810
very much than any ICANN board member

628
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:13,290
has ever read the entire bylaws but

629
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:15,480
they're all behind into him I'm ignoring

630
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,760
a lot of stuff learning with us where

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU wanted to get itself anointed as</font>

Internet Governance forum etc and i'm

635
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,980
generally ignoring the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

636
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:36,930
basically pooped in its own nest and

637
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,330
blew a huge amount of community goodwill

638
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:41,970
at the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> going very secret very</font>

literally but despite<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that I can</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ana functions has been seen</font>

642
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,800
by the I star community which is the

643
00:29:53,310 --> 00:30:00,540
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's w3c and the IETF and the</font>

644
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:03,840
IAB and the rirs etc as the best game in

645
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:06,810
town it is still not directly under a

646
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,429
set of governments set of governments

647
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:12,389
running this function is not what you

648
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:15,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">want if you want a internet which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

649
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,160
simply another telephone company you

650
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,590
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> an internet which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the internet</font>

651
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,050
you don't want it to be a government-run

652
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:24,149
organization so the general view is it's

653
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:28,470
better than any<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative that we've</font>

654
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:32,510
seen and so repeatedly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rirs and the</font>

655
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:34,760
IETF and the w3c have always supported

656
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,350
continuing the iono function and

657
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,800
continuing it on the general area under

658
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:44,550
I can and it's today's state that's the

659
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,889
way it works the world changed we've got

660
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,720
change real changes in the internet

661
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:54,960
environment the political environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

662
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,730
much as anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2001 Brazil and India</font>

663
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,860
South Africa

664
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:05,549
where they came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a new proposal</font>

665
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to move the governance to the UN boy</font>

666
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:11,460
that would have been good but that

667
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:14,010
didn't go anywhere and then then June of

668
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,770
2013 Edward Snowden showed up and said

669
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:19,260
hey the US isn't the good guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

670
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:22,230
pretend to be and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty</font>

671
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,690
important because many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the proposals</font>

672
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:28,919
in wis asst and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU have been</font>

673
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:32,400
stopped by the USA where the benevolent

00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:34,410
dictator we're good guys we got where

675
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,240
dictator but we're good guys we control

676
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">this internet thing for everybody's</font>

677
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,950
benefit and Snowden comes up and says

678
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:45,990
well maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> not and that made the</font>

679
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:48,960
politicians job to try and stop some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

680
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:52,440
these movements much much harder when I

681
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,929
suspect directly led to the decision on

682
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,600
the Department of Commerce to actually

683
00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,179
finally blow the bolts because they

684
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,159
couldn't continue to see how it would

685
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:05,070
they could protect they could continue

686
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to protect the internet from the ITU and</font>

687
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,870
the turret and the UN<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

internet cooperation which said let's

692
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,520
let's actually move on to what the these

693
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,780
proposals have been saying that

694
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,879
department of commerce have been saying

695
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,590
forever which is that it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private</font>

696

company and should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done outside of</font>

mondiale initiative which was not part

699
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:36,418
of the I star this was something where

700
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,940
the chairman of ICANN decided that the

701
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:41,760
future is a new organization a new

702
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:45,200
thingy that is going to manage the world

703
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,549
and we're going to be there forever and

perpetual seats and all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

705
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:54,510
and this was let's say mixed reviews the

864
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,770
function but a technic series of

865
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:06,420
technical functions that's what

all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various internet constituency's</font>

from the technical people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

877
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,730
and nurtured the internet from its

878
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,440
earliest days to the commercial

879
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:42,690
interests who now see it as an important

880
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,869
business tool to individual users from

881
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:50,780
around the globe I can't doesn't do much

882
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:54,119
for individual users and it certainly is

883
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:57,030
massively larger than John ever imagined

884
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could be but it's still the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

thanks very much that was it was really

890
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:37,520
wonderful the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned early there</font>

891
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,230
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> John had a technical issue with</font>

892
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,330
the registry registrar mo could you

893
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,810
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about that he just</font>

894
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:48,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought it wouldn't work technically I</font>

895
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:52,609
happened to be I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

896
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:55,040
consensus of the ad hoc committee before

897
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:56,990
a nice I saw board meeting that John and

898
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,850
I were both in and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to him</font>

899
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:01,580
and told him what the results were and

900
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,440
he's a bad idea technically a bad idea

901
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,569
and didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really go into much more</font>

902
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,540
detail than that it just he just thought

903
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it was not something we would put</font>

904
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,100
together to technology to do it

905
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:19,130
reasonably but I don't know specifically

906
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:22,549
what his objection was high anyone said

907
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:25,130
I see Scott thanks a lot for this sort

908
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:27,800
of a technical question what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font>

909
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:30,200
yelled at about in London could you

910
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain the experiment of redirecting</font>

911
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:39,259
the route John sent mail to the email to

912
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:44,540
the non-us TLD that root server ups

913
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:48,130
folks asking that they point their zone

914
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:50,810
update to his machine rather than to the

915
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:53,119
verisign the network solutions machine

916
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:57,320
the network solutions with the

917
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">designated proper source didn't change</font>

918
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,119
any text in there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was exactly the</font>

919
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,800
same information but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pointing to</font>

920
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:06,650
hit a machine under John's personal

921
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,770
control rather than the officially

922
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:15,320
sanctioned one and he and a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

923
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:17,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the root server ops people did and it</font>

924
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,540
took a couple days for the for that to

925
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:25,009
be discovered and when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was discovered</font>

926
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:27,619
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it got in the press as</font>

927
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:29,240
I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Magaziner was he actually</font>

928
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:31,040
literally threatened to send in the

929
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Marines not the figurative Marines but</font>

930
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,700
the literal Marines because John was a

931
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">government contractor</font>

932
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:45,960
and this was outside acting outside of

933
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:48,599
his permit because it would that have

934
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:54,680
been the first example of swatting yeah

935
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:54,680
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right thanks</font>
