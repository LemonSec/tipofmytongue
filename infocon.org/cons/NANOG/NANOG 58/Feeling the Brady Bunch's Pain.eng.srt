00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,250
speak with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us or speak to us about but</font>

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:17,550

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,350
you excuse me thank you um I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,939
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standing between</font>

you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Aaron update so it will be</font>

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:32,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">very brief</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright mark now I like</font>

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,079
they're an update I really did thank you

11
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright this is what I'm going to talk</font>

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,190
about basically we had two networks that

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,690
we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together we had a an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> A&I</font>

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,550
prototype network that we there was a

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,589
grant-funded network that was a full

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,870
nationwide hundred gig network and the

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,210
purpose of the network was to basically

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,910
say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give a hundred gig to the</font>

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">scientists will they come will they be</font>

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,379
able to do ten times the science at a

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,600
hundred gig then they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do at</font>

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,129
10 gig and the answer is basically yes

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,570
it's kind of a simplistic answer but

24
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,910
there were both qualitative and

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,379
quantitative benefits to science by

26
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,509
increasing the bandwidth science is

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,369
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much bandwidth constrain so</font>

28
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,990
having demonstrated that the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

29
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,000
now let's take the hundred gig network

30
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,530
and give it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scientists by merging</font>

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,520
it into the production network that we

32
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,700
have in yes net so what were the two big

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,460
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to do we had two</font>

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,920
networks that were logically separate

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,990
and they were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> BG be paired with</font>

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,640
each other in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

37
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,048
to an es net might pier with each other

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,850
are actually duped here with each other

39
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,590
in the same way that we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier with</font>

40
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,020
some of your networks out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> too at</font>

41
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,240
different areas and the big difference

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,890
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the table here was we had</font>

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,089
different I gps running in the network

44
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,220
that was going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get fixed</font>

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we put them together and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

46
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,158

64
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,230
there is we not only didn't we want to

65
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,000
put the network down but we didn't want

66
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,230
I pv6 to be treated<font color="#CCCCCC"> any differently than</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first big issue that we had to do</font>

before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we merge the two networks was to</font>

70
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,040
decide whether to merge the I GPS or

71
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,630
leave things as they were and I'm going

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,310
to you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of make a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,769
confession here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have about 30 minutes</font>

worth of content and about 20 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

75
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,069
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I only wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually take</font>

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,290
20 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this talk because this</font>

77
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">parts really boring and so I don't want</font>

78
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,489
to actually have to go through it so

79
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,200
instead that's all on the slides all you

80
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,760
could do is read the slides when you're

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,738
about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fall asleep or something like</font>

82
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,120
that but this actually talks about the

83
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,860
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision process we went through</font>

84
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,570
so e to decide whether to merge the I

85
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,070
GPS through a pros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cons of doing</font>

86
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,109
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decide when we were going to do</font>

87
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,459
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> their pros and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cons as to when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

88
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,870
we do it before we're merging the

89
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">networks do we do it during or do we do</font>

90
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,350
it after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we to decide whether we're</font>

91
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,450
going to use Isis or whether we're going

92
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,370
to use ospf v2 and v3<font color="#E5E5E5"> and converge</font>

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,709
around that pros and cons to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

94
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,730
obviously we decided to do Isis we had

95
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,920
to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether we're going to use</font>

96
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,750
multi topology or single topology Isis

97
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,720
there were pros and cons to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

98
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided to do multi topology how do we</font>

99
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,160
do the switch once we've decided to

100
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,390
switch to multi topology Isis<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

101
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,880
not all router vendors have

compatibility mode where you can switch

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fly between single and multi</font>

106
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,760
from single to multi topology because

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,400
you will lose your<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your ipv6</font>

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,989

112
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,840
black holing ipv6 traffic and remember

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">our SLA parity says we want ipv6 to be</font>

115
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,039
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treat ipv4 so</font>

116
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,560
we couldn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this switch as a</font>

117
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,900
forklift we had to do something else

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,610
because not all routers had compat

119
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">bility mode we actually had to add</font>

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,790
ospfv3 as a temporary protocol just

121
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,039
around I pv6 while we were switching to

122
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,479
multi topology and I mentioned I make a

123
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">reference to Caltrans here the</font>

California Department of Transportation

once built the highest freeway ramp in

all of California just as a temporary

127

measure so they could work on the one

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
was down below it that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font>

doing construction down below and it

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,070
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a couple extra</font>

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">me think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was being Caltrans here</font>

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,400
just by turning on ospfv3 but it turns

135
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,620
out it was really easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do because the</font>

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,049
ospfv3 configuration and most routing

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,470
ipv6 routing configuration and all you

139
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do is programmatically go</font>

140
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,430
through and scrape all your router's

141
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:16,229
generate ospf config slam them in and

142
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">then do a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff to compare the</font>

143
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,639
routes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're seeing in Isis and</font>

144
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:23,219
ospf that yielded very interesting

145
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,990
results as it turns out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

146
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">give away one of my lessons learned here</font>

147
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,120
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you turn on ospfv3 and</font>

148
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,310
you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been routing ipv6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Isis</font>

149
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,320
for a while ospfv3 is going to show you

150
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,669
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting misconfigurations that</font>

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,800
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have had on some of your</font>

152
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,150
point-to-point interfaces Isis won't

153
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,280
catch those because it's running it

154
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,169
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 it's just forwarding this is</font>

another<font color="#CCCCCC"> address-family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font>

156
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,969
whereas ospfv3 is actually relying on

157
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,800
the layer 3 existence of the ipv6

158
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,020
configuration and the layer 3

159
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,690
consistency of the ipv6 configuration

160
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,219
it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you problems and so</font>

161
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,800
it's very important if you're running

162
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,110
Isis with both address families to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,789
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of BFD capability I'm not</font>

164
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,010
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Bradford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Regional Airport</font>

165
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:08,180

166
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,740
fault detection when I say BFD and so

167
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,389
BFD is very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> not all router</font>

168
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,680
vendors support it both<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 and ipv6</font>

169
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:18,330
until I want to like basically tell

170
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,460
routers especially if your router vendor

171
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,130
whose name begins with j that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

172
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,979
important to support both ipv4 and ipv6

173
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,300
bft and integrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> them with Isis so that</font>

174
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,280
you can actually withdrawal routes when

175
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,870
you have misconfigurations and broken

176
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,219
interfaces<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we had one other</font>

177
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,960
decision we had to make and that has to

178
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:38,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">do with sort of one-offs and you can</font>

179
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,489
read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the slides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not going</font>

180
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,110
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

181
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,660
about it too much but it basically has

182
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,910
to do with the way for our sites that

183
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,680
don't have carry a full table you know

184
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,539
how do we announce default to them when

185
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,310
we have special default prefixes and the

186
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,500
way we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrying those was in both</font>

187
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,690
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp and an IV GP and we needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

188
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,979
clean that up that was going to induce

189
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">some risk that we might have some</font>

190
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,539
individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> site outages and it turns</font>

191
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,800
out that did happen because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some like</font>

192
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,690
I said some really weird one-off

193
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,940
configurations that we had but overall

194
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,860
the whole process worked very well so

195
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,479
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a visualization of the decision</font>

196
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,520
it's not a true decision tree in a game

197
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,380
theoretic notion because there's no

198
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,169
payoffs I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font>

199
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,120
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pros and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cons but you can</font>

200
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,770
see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decisions that we made led</font>

201
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,539
to other decisions and actually led to

202
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,400
more work particularly because we chose

203
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,139
that rat that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

204
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,330
way on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right hand side so you can</font>

205
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how that leads to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of other</font>

206
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,590
complexities that we have to get through

207
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,030
just to put the I GPS together in the

208
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,880
way we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to without causing any</font>

209
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,739
traffic black holing so then we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

210
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,719
do it we had to create a plan a very

211
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,120
detailed plan which you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it was I</font>

212
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,440
did it in a google doc here and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

213
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">was kind of interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

214
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,000
space for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had major steps and</font>

215
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,590
detailed steps and remarks and things

216
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,789
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and I had a little space for</font>

217
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone to sign up so they could</font>

218
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:53,849
actually say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this one</font>

219
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,490
particular step we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

220
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,719
interesting um maybe I should talk with

221
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,789
the folks at Google very interesting

222
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:02,880
failure because I know all my<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-workers</font>

223
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:05,520
immediately rush to sign up and do all

224
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,960
this work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when i logged in their</font>

225
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,549
names weren't there it was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> blank</font>

226
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,349
like the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had left the document</font>

227
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,639
days before so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i assumed there was some</font>

228
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:14,699
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> google problem that caused that</font>

229
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm not sure anyway what ended up</font>

230
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,039
happening is I ended up doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

231
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,020
the work now this is kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

232
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,818
important lesson learn which is you

233
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want anyone engineer in your</font>

234
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:26,340
network no matter how brilliant he may

235
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:27,569
be to do all this work so what we ended

236
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,090
up doing is I did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the work and</font>

237
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:31,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking over my shoulder</font>

238
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,750
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually ended up doing the merge of</font>

239
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks I managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it in such</font>

240
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,589
a way that I had it the timing scheduled

241
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,179
so that I'd be on travel for a good

242
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:40,649
chunk of the work and so that other

243
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,649
people would have to do the work but

244
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:47,070
we'll get to that in a second here all

245
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:49,230
the steps we did so you can you can read

246
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">through those and I already talked about</font>

247
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,139
the outcome the need for BFD

248
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:59,339
in both ospf in both ipv4 and ipv6 when

249
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:01,889
you're running Isis and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're</font>

250
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,999
actually we merge the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I GPS we put them</font>

251
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:06,029
together now we're going to merge the

252
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:08,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks okay and how best to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

253
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:11,670
with again not causing any downtime on

254
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:13,350
our production services we could take

255
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,238
the prototype network and shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down</font>

256
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,819
we didn't have that many production

257
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:19,709
services on that so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to move</font>

258
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:21,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">the production services on to the</font>

259
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,878
existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes net for network that gave</font>

260
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:26,040
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opportunity to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do for a short</font>

261
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,529
time some<font color="#CCCCCC"> break in fix stuff we could</font>

262
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,540
also move our sdn circuits or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oscar</font>

263
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,220
circuits but we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> coordinate those</font>

264
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,618
those were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they didn't have to be</font>

265
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,790
total<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100% up time but we did have to</font>

266
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:39,869
coordinate when we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving those</font>

267
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:42,059
circuits so given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

268
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:44,850
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and started to merge the actual</font>

269
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,738
routers into the new network and we're

270
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking a different platform ALU and</font>

271
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:49,439
putting into a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

272
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">predominantly juniper so we had to</font>

273
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:53,790
rewrite a lot of our tools to make sure

274
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,199
they supported ALU and we went through a

275
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,699
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steps which you can go ahead</font>

276
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,738
and read through what I'm going to do is

277
00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:01,799
give it to you in the miraculous

278
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:04,649
graphical format that uses the metaphor

279
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,899
of the Brady Bunch this is why I use

280
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,239
this in my title we need to take these

281
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:13,139
two networks and somehow make them a

282
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:15,869
family so in this diagram the<font color="#CCCCCC"> male</font>

283
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,899
Brady's represent the existing ESN for

284
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:21,480
juniper routers and the female Brady's

285
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,549
represent the alcatel-lucent routers and

286
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,949
the prototype network and I had to add

287
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:27,540
cousin Oliver and Alice to sort of make

288
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:29,729
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra pop this is obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

289
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,139
stylized diagram if you want to see a

290
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,519
real diagram that yes that you can

291
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,660
basically look at the diagrams of

292
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,489
Internet to from the previous

293
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,249
presentation because as Chris pointed

294
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:39,989
out we share the same physical footprint

295
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:42,529
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what they look like when they</font>

296
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:45,029
were actually all plugged in now the

297
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,189
thick red lines or hundred gig links

298
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,410
through red routers or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ale the ALU</font>

299
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:51,719
routers in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> prototype network and the</font>

300
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,549
blue routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> re s net for and they are</font>

301
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,110
connected with multiple 10 gig links

302
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:58,079
those are the thinner blue lines you see

303
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:01,289
some black thin 10 gig lines those black

304
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,719
lines are lags and they are ebgp

305
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:05,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">earrings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between the two networks so</font>

306
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,990
what's the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we do</font>

307
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,370
we build a bunch of configurations and

308
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,050
we had to rebuild<font color="#E5E5E5"> our configuration</font>

309
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,510
templates which are ya<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mille templates</font>

310
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,449
then we to generate configurations for

311
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,400
each of these ALU routers when we did

312
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,560
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put them on the flash and we did</font>

313
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,870
a big reboot we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically rebooted all</font>

314
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,410
the routers at once and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

315
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">it put them into a situation where they</font>

316
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,219
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet bgp meshed ibgp mesh with</font>

317
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of us at four that's why</font>

318
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,950
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray but they did bring up Isis</font>

319
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,870
adjacencies along all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gig</font>

320
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,610
links so the hundred gay twinks came up

321
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,780
immediately we just costed them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

322
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,780
production so they weren't actually

323
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,370
routing a lot of they<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't actually</font>

324
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,930
traversing traffic there was routing

325
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,760
happening but there wasn't any traffic

326
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,560
going over them the next thing we did

327
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,450
you can see we added some links between

328
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,699
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ALUs and the junipers between the</font>

male and female<font color="#E5E5E5"> brady's those became</font>

330
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,290
ecmp links that was another decision

331
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,120
that we made<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't really go into it</font>

332
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,400
we didn't have any good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason either</font>

333
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">way but we felt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe ecmp would</font>

334
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,390
reduce some of the variables that lags

335
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,790
put in you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of wanted</font>

336
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,620
to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things so we wanted to</font>

337
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,650
add links because we were concerned

338
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">about bottlenecks along certain 10 gig</font>

339
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,610
portions of the network as we brought

340
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,290
the hundred gig portions up there might

341
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,790
be too much funneling of traffic in 200

342
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,730
gigs so to be very careful also how we

343
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,040
did our<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP costs as well so now what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

344
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,440
start doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going through and meshing</font>

345
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the routers connecting them up in this</font>

346
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,330
case what we're doing is taking the

347
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,550
different ALU routers they're becoming

348
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,150
part of the ESN for which is now

349
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:41,160
becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes net</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ibgp mesh and at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

350
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,250
point we now have the full network in

351
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,770
place so we have I big I<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp routing and</font>

352
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,780
we have Isis routing with all the

353
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,220
routers in the network the only thing

354
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,860
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not happening here is 100 gig</font>

355
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,350
links aren't costed into place and with

356
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,180
them you know push of the button now all

357
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a sudden 100 gig links are now costed</font>

358
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">in to the point where they're actually</font>

key is here we have to now get rid of

361
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,500
the 10 gig links because that was part

of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 service that they were</font>

365

366
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,750
rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we cost the 10 gig links</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me about a minute or two to</font>

upgrade the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> just there so what</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lessons learned one of the most</font>

374
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,310
important lessons learned was having a

375
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,960
plan also having the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right people and</font>

376
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,209
having lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people do it now this is</font>

377
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,920
this is the group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in yes tent</font>

378
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,970
that worked on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

379
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,329
out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth</font>

380
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,550
there's really no reason to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

381
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,650
my replacing cousin Oliver has any

382
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,979
significance what I really did here is

383
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,569
just reproduced in groups the different

384
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,850
things that people did so you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yvonne</font>

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hines for example a long time Nana like</font>

387
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:01,360
routing and IP addressing you can see

390
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,100
stuff so a lot of people doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:11,100
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in this network now one</font>

392
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,180
of the other major lessons learned was

393
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:19,120
sometimes routers have bugs who knew so

394
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,130
in this particular diagram now we've got

395
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,050
the full<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes that five in place we've</font>

396
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,939
got three routers to juniper routers

397
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,719
which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> represented by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the two Brady</font>

398
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,030
kids there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and an ALU router which is</font>

399
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,350
completely part of the network now which

400
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is represented by my colleague Joe</font>

401
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,530
Metzger Joe doesn't really like this

402
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,880
slide because he thinks it makes him

403
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,069
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like he's the father of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

404
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,000
Brady's which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand why he</font>

405
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,500
thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but one day we had a</font>

406
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,620
situation where we have a lot of these

407
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,360
ecmp links connecting the ALU routers

408
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,160
and what I don't show there is that Joe

409
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,530
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple hundred gig up links coming</font>

410
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,510
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of him and so he's got all these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

411
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">gig ecmp links coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into him so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

412
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,280
he has enough bandwidth to go to the

413
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,959
downstream junipers and one day we

414
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,500
realized we had to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> a line card</font>

415
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:08,320
in Joe so we that line card served two

416
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,910
of the links right there of it for ECM

417
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,860
peeling so we had to cost those links

418
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,069
out of production as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we costed</font>

419
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,350
the links out of production<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marsha or</font>

420
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:20,410
whoever that is started routing traffic

421
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,270
the wrong way even traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> destined for</font>

422
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,819
Joe's loopback she was routing over

423
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,650
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Bobby I don't know if that's</font>

424
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,030
Bobby Orr or not but let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pretend</font>

425
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,709
it's Bobby she starts routing it to

426
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:35,480
Bobby now when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Marcia's</font>

427
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:37,700
routing table it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it says all</font>

428
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,530
this traffic all these addresses all

429
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,690
these routes I'm forwarding out the ecmp

430
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,339
links the remaining ecmp links that's

431
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,270
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> says in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table but</font>

432
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,310
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what she's actually</font>

433
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,329
doing she's forwarding the traffic the

434
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,709
other way now how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know what she</font>

435
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,870
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at net flow</font>

436
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:54,170
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it netflow the packets are</font>

437
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,490
going out the wrong interface so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

438
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">very interesting because the routing</font>

439
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,300
table shows everything is right<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow</font>

440
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,740
shows that it's wrong and the actual

441
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,930
experience of the fact that we can no

442
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">longer get to Joe's loopback also shows</font>

443
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">that she's doing something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong here</font>

444
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marsha there is doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

445
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,760
wrong so what we did is we said well

446
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we might as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just pull the line</font>

447
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,350
card now because you know we can't we

448
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,820
can't get the we can't see any traffic

449
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,820
here and as soon as we pulled the line

450
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,640
card everything went back to normal so

451
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,740
my conjecture here is that Marsha did a

452
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,620
fib update and all of a sudden whatever

453
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,180
was wrong with the fib got fixed it

454
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,920
didn't change the routing the routing

455
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,959
table hadn't changed at all but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fib</font>

456
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,469
update happened because the interfaces

457
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,540
drop link so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we did said okay</font>

458
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,580
let's put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new routing put the new</font>

459
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,500
line card back in let's put the links in

460
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,940
costs out of production nothing goes

461
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong we put the links into production</font>

462
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,370
nothing goes wrong so just that one

463
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:51,319
little part caused someone's fib to go

464
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,790
wrong this happened three different

465
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,470
times at different parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

466
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,030
we were doing different pieces of

467
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,700
maintenance so we found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were</font>

468
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:01,550
some interesting vagaries that happen

469
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,730
with ecmp links and that caused<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

470
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,020
the routing to have weird things Joe

471
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,790
Metzger incidentally thought that I'd

472
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,400
screwed up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp when I did the igp</font>

473
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,079
merge and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was obviously in my best</font>

474
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,310
interest to figure out what Marcia was

475
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,929
doing there when she was forwarding

476
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,000
traffic the wrong way and it turns out

477
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:20,600
it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routers fault not my</font>

478
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,359
fault i'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to report so what other</font>

479
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,189
lessons the importance of planning is

480
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,649
really good having a detailed plan this

481
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just one page of the plan</font>

482
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,400
it this is now in a wiki I didn't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

483
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,960
a Google Doc this time of actually

484
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,810
merging the routing of the two networks

485
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,490
so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you know how much</font>

486
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,490
stuff there is in there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and really</font>

487
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we ended up having was a lot of</font>

488
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">different people working on this</font>

489
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,250
and because you have written plan you

490
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,480
can actually anyone can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up if</font>

491
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,580
someone's out or someone's traveling

492
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,340
someone's at<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana's like I was you can</font>

493
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,230
have other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people pick it up so a lot of</font>

494
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,459
those steps happen when I was gone even

495
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,900
though I was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

496
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,220
leading the plan it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really easy to</font>

497
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to do that the other really</font>

498
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,840
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> part about planning is that</font>

499
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,990
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you write a plan to do something like</font>

500
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">this you actually begin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think through</font>

501
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,070
the process so carefully that you find

502
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,149
dependencies and you find other things

503
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">you find things that are going to go</font>

504
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,170
wrong before you actually do it and it's

505
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:16,850
a good way to kind of fix the things

506
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,100
that go<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong before they even go wrong</font>

507
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:22,010
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plan is extremely important</font>

508
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:25,760
for that it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing how well</font>

509
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:28,610
things did work in the end so with that

510
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,679
thank you very much that concludes the

511
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,678
presentation and I welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>

512
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,270
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right thanks Michael</font>
