think the policies are crafted correctly

and and what we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do to change them to</font>

was any objections to us handling this

114
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:43,758
as an editorial change to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Newark</font>

believe may 29th or 30th there were no

117
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:55,580
objections noted so the intent of the AC

is at our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> call to vote to recommend</font>

in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin was still following that</font>

130
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:33,800
guidance even today so that proposal

131
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,719
will most likely be eliminated once we

132
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,779
make that recommendation to the board

133
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,790

want to is there is this an opportunity

the benefits of doing that obviously i

delay SN resources could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> recovered</font>

business needs of various sorts when

another region participated in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot</font>

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,500
poor transfer to do similar things and

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:52,689
it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some parity between the</font>

most of the folks who have spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

243
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,269
against this have done so on the basis

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,209
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't really necessary for</font>

245
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:07,550
several reasons one might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

246
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:09,979
don't think that SN transfers were

necessary to<font color="#CCCCCC"> begin with another might be</font>

248
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,560
that there simply is no shortage of them

249
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,319
and as John already mentioned without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

250
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,380
similar transfer policy allowing that in

<font color="#E5E5E5">another region there is simply nothing</font>

252
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:29,750
that this policy proposal does in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

253
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,910
situation so our questions as the AC to

254
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,670
you as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community are is this</font>

255
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,890
necessary and useful and should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

256
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,500
this forward or abandon it as you saw on

257
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:43,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the previous slides we had some lukewarm</font>

258
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,649
response from the community because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

259
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,510
of the folks who spoke up in favor of

260
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:49,670
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy proposal were from the nanog</font>

261
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,500
community I felt it was important to

262
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,199
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back here and hear from you</font>

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really think this needs to</font>

264
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,829
move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from you</font>

265
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,649

266
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:03,560
up when we asked the question in the

267
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:05,779
absence of any interest then I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

268
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,089
hear people opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on whether we should</font>

269
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,709
just go ahead and abandon this as

270
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,660
unnecessary so one way or the other I'd

271
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:14,979
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your input as to whether we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can make a decision here</font>

thank you Scott so as pointed out this

277
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,700

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not getting a lot of support so if</font>

you could stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up now if you're in the</font>

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,770
her do not support this policy here let

283
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,939
me model that behavior Lee Howard Time

284

Warner Cable opposed mildly I don't

285

00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,830
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful but I did want to</font>

287
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,130
ask a question because I believe that

288
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:03,860
this would modify or be affected section

289
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,530
eight dot for right of the policy manual

290
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:11,530
so there's specified transferring

291
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:11,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">ar-ar-ar transfers which says that the</font>

who they take may only take place<font color="#E5E5E5"> via so</font>

293
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,140
maybe take place only by<font color="#E5E5E5"> our ours who</font>

294
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,319
agree to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transfer and share</font>

295
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,720
reciprocal compatible needs based policy

296
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,010
do we have needs based policy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SNS</font>

297
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,900
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate that you need an</font>

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">asn is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correct and do other rirs</font>

299
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:34,630
also have needs-based sm policies mr.

300
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:37,490
Kern um so recognize that that we don't

301
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,350
preemptively mail people postcards with

302
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,230
random a ascends on them they have to

303
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:45,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually say they want one that for</font>

304
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,900
purposes of a SN is saying you have need

305
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,500
and it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the other area so</font>

306
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,720
we recognize such as a need space policy

307
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,060
the level of rigor varies by our iron

308
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,880
some rirs you actually have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

309
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,489
tending towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing or some</font>

310
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,370
equivalent statement and so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,400
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> HR ir determines what is</font>

312
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:11,150
appropriate there though can I infer

313
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,640
that you would read the other rirs<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">based policies as compatible when</font>

315
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,460
another rir passes a policy or proposes

316
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,960
one that's similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will stand in their</font>

317

form and tell them whether it's

318
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,190
compatible or not which I've done for

<font color="#CCCCCC">the need based test just like in the</font>

assessment for ipv4 as a general thing

340
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,890
in their policy manual that doesn't

341
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,170
preclude someone introducing one a

policy that introduces needs assessment

343

00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:26,810
talking about transferring from one R&R

361

to another John um and I have no view

in favor opposed whatever you decide

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,860
folks decide makes sense we do have

365
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:40,040
cases where people may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business</font>

they may

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,240
have some sort of change that they've

369
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,149
gone through and they find themselves

370
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,680
able to update the records for ipv4 but

371
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,020
they may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to indicate that</font>

presently is no way to officially

recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's left the building</font>

does that make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if</font>

that use case comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up very often but it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is a possible use case fajr rear</font>

389
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:34,070
microphone yeah Jared watch NTT if I

390
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,600
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update a record and provide you</font>

391
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,909
a valid address and it's not in your

392
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:45,620
region will you update it even if it's

393
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:48,500
the correct address so the organization

394
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,280
if the organization is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin</font>

395
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,750
region then you saying you're changing

396
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,280
the organization record to reflect its

397
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,550
now out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of region because the</font>

398
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,160
organization moved maybe my mailing

399
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,230
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is out of region we've had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

400
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,030
happen I mean we there's no invocation

401
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,640
there's no enforcement of that per se

402
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,170
but there are people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reflect</font>

403
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,420
the fact that the business is broken up

404
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:14,930
into pieces they're still here but that

405
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,900
piece is now in another agent go ahead

406
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:20,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what it sounds like is</font>

407
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,150
that this proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not be necessary</font>

408
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,709
because you will update<font color="#E5E5E5"> the records</font>

409
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:29,840
based on the resource the request of the

410
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,570
person for whom the resources have been

411
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,840
allocated to even if they're outside of

412
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,840
the region

413
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:44,360
right Kevin Bloomberg so one thing I

414
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:47,928
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clarify each region was given</font>

415
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,238
blocks of<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS numbers so that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

416
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:51,649
get nice to be done I believe that was

417
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:55,820
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intent of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your original</font>

418
00:19:51,649 --> 00:20:00,678
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe one of the benefits</font>

419
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:03,379
of this is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> allow both IP space and</font>

420
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:07,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">asn numbers to be transferred at the</font>

421
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:10,039
same time through 8.4 whereas right now

422
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:12,469
what you would need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is an 8.4</font>

423
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,840
transfer of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS number sorry</font>

424
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,850
of the IP numbers and not be able to

425
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,799
transfer the AAS number but probably use

426
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,918
it but not necessarily know where it's

427
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,259
actually being used so if you know I

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if you can do an eight point</font>

429
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,580
to transfer out of region which would be

430
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:30,949
a merger and acquisition so if you're

431
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,100
selling from one unit to another you

432
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,600
couldn't necessarily do it out of region

433
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,199
so this would allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

434
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,988

435
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,210
and sales no just John I want to clarify

436
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:46,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I guess the previous question</font>

437
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,960
was about maybe the policy is rough not

438
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:49,429
relevant because he was talking more

439
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,929
about address update but this policy

440
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:52,970
would also allow to transfer to another

441
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:55,820
organization all together correct we

442
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:58,039
would not do without this policy right

443
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,749
of region<font color="#CCCCCC"> president I in region but not</font>

444
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,460
out of region presently a party could

445
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:03,289
say I have more IP addresses that i need

446
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,940
i'm transferring these numbers for

<font color="#E5E5E5">parting an AP Nick that has a reciprocal</font>

00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,309
I also have 5a s numbers and I'm I want

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of two of them and I'm going</font>

452
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,960
to sell them to the same unit over there

453
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:20,779
in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia-pacific region we would say</font>

454
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,559
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible we literally will</font>

455
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:26,539
not allow that transfer now you could

456
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:29,029
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could they could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use them we don't</font>

457
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:31,220
enforce routing but if you actually

458
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,980
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell the a SS that's not</font>

459
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,950
actually possible per policy thank you

463
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,100
is one of the main use cases I guess

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,960
could be transferred under this policy

happens today quite a bit actually

that's what that's what I thought so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,299
my personal opinion I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know that</font>

491
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,789
this is entirely necessary at this point

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:32,330
within the region and what this policy

511
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,269
if passed would allow them now to be

00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,929
can only be accomplished within the

516
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:45,710
to a party unrelated outside the region

00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,640
because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of value in</font>

533
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,990
that brass so you're just gonna end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

534
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,490
with these<font color="#CCCCCC"> essence that don't go</font>

536
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,299
that so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've understand your</font>

537
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,590
comment you're just reinforcing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

538
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:31,540
think that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the reasons this</font>

539
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:34,629
policy was proposed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font>

540
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposer way back is that there's an</font>

541
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,220
inconsistency in the current specified

542
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,640
transfer and that it covers<font color="#CCCCCC"> v4 resources</font>

543
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,380
but did not cover ESS for inter ir yeah

544
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,720
yeah basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i'm just saying</font>

545
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's a hypothetical scenario</font>

546
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,610
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might end up with all sorts of</font>

547
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,980
a SMS that don't belong to anyone and

548
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:58,120
right with the circumstance that happens

549
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:01,000
is that the receiving party it doesn't

550
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the they remain with the</font>

551
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,370
original register on that can cause all

552
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,350
sorts of interesting issues several

553
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,540
years later if it turns out the original

554
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">register doesn't care the party that's</font>

555
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:17,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recipients using them anyway the</font>

556
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:20,139
databases don't reflect that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

557
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:25,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of demand for for</font>

558
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:26,770
our fur asn transfers but we said the

559
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,428
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the region</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we've</font>

560
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,570
had half a dozen of them occur so there

561
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:34,030
are people who make use of these

562
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,590
policies hard to tell who and when and

563
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,500
for what it's worth I've had people

564
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,639
approach me trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get essence so</font>

565
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,760
then I would take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in</font>

566
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,410
favor the policy is written<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

567
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">playing devil's advocate I'm not sure</font>

568
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,440
that's really necessary if there are

enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> essence out there that there's</font>

this comment go ahead sir<font color="#CCCCCC"> Derek Waldrop</font>

577
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,600
integrated broadband I believe

578
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:15,580
inherently that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs don't really</font>

579
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,610
hold much value and that it just seems

580
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,949
more likely that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be removed</font>

581
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:23,320
most of the purchaser v4 addresses from

582
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,360
a different region you know that's

583
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,279
what's the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know I would</font>

584
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,740
think and that they already most likely

585
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,600
have their own autonomous system and so

586
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,860
I'm opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the transfer i think it</font>

587
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,408
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more cleanly for them just</font>

588
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,299
basically return and then in some case

589
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:39,340
that they needed one just apply for a

590
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:43,679
new one within their own region<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

591
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:46,240
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in favor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we will now</font>

592
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,549
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would ask is where the</font>

593
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,309
again the audience participation time

594
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:53,379
I'd ask those a remote and in the room

595
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to ask a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

597
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,990
forward this will be advice provided to

598
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,519
the Advisory Council so I would ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

599
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:07,120
all those in the room who are in favor

600
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,600
of moving this proposal forward to

601
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,549
please raise your hand nice and high

602
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,370
anyone who can hear my voice is allowed

603
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:21,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put their hand up and our counters</font>

604
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:23,879
will count I think I think I got it

605
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:27,639
there's also the remote obviously and

606
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:29,908
those that are opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to moving this</font>

607
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:29,908
forward

608
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,840
please keep them up until I ask

609
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,049
are they able to put their hands down

610
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,719
there Susan<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can put your hands</font>

611
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:51,309
down I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose for the sound is it</font>

612
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,630
possible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the mics and thing a</font>

614
00:27:52,630 --> 00:28:02,529
hard to hear some of the questions I

00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:05,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know ok just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a moment I'm waiting</font>

resource policy it originated in March

00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:07,070
of this year Scott librarian and rs of

629
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,970
the Shepherd's Robert seized from it was

630
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:13,460
presented at iron 31 in Barbados and

631
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:15,560
there was discussion it would lower the

632
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,180
utilization threshold for additional

633
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,500
ipv4 allocations for the 3gpp networks

634
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:27,080
there's no similar proposals or

635
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:31,550
discussions at other rirs it was it's

636
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:34,189
still in development by the AC so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

637
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:38,810
perform when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they told us it's ready to</font>

638
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:41,300
be reviewed and now I will invite Scott

639
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,909
who's coming up for this one or Scott I

640
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,350
will invite Scott up I ask the people

641
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,110
when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> come to the mic speak slowly</font>

642
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,449
and clearly somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there on the</font>

643
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:53,240
end of a webcast someone is doing a

644
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:57,140
transcription think of that person when

645
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">you speak okay so i always like really</font>

646
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,490
slowly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and clearly something to keep</font>

647
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,490
that up you

648
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:15,530
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm back this one is a little bit</font>

649
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:17,629
less simple the original problem

650
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:21,860
statement here in summary of the

651
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:23,510
original proposal was that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is at</font>

652
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,178
least one mobile network operator that

653
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:29,030
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some trouble getting enough</font>

654
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">global unique addresses for their needs</font>

655
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:34,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">so someone from that operator put</font>

656
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:38,389
together a policy proposal to help

657
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:42,679
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

658
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:45,470
proposal would basically relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

659
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:50,690
eighty percent requirement in certain

660
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:54,880
situations that would allow for well

661
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:59,630
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that in this next slide so</font>

662
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,720
they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of non ra are</font>

663
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:06,650
assigned address blocks internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

664
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:09,890
provide addressing two handsets behind

665

their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nats RFC 1918 is not large enough</font>

666
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:17,660
for some of these large networks RFC 65

667
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:20,330
98 the / 10 doesn't help either so they

668
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,590
have a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise unrounded</font>

669
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,260
blocks that they have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

670
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,299
historically as that space is brought

back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> service via returns</font>

being used on the inside of a large

675
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,970
mobile network so they have been going

676
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,610
through the effort of remembering into

677
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">global a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unique space that requires some</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">if anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really wants to we talked</font>

686
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:05,120
is there failover architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

687
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,720
requires what's essentially fifty

688
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,159
percent utilization in that one region

689
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,330
needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick up for another</font>

690
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,790
region if

691
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,530
is an outage so that conflicts with the

692
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:19,280
eighty percent utilization requirement

693
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:22,100
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current policy so we did discuss</font>

694
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,260
this at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin 31 in Barbados there were a</font>

695
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,149
number of folks who felt this problem

696
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,820
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific to a single customers</font>

697
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,140
needs and was not more general one of

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions that we brought to the</font>

community was is this a problem for more

700
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,830
networks there were some folks that felt

701
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,020
that this was a broader problem not

702
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,000
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> for mobile networks that</font>

for various reasons it might be useful

00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,690
to apply a policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's slightly more</font>

707
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,970
relaxed others felt that there was we

708
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:57,050
needed more information to really know

709
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,480
if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a problem so obviously if we</font>

operator and probably other operators as

00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:11,300
well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow them to reduce</font>

excessive use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT and address</font>

715
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,270
conflicts obviously making it easier to

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,160
get ipv4 addresses if we're able to do

717
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,900
so through the policy cycle before well

718
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:25,370
they're still here is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

accelerate ipv4 depletion it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unclear</font>

720
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,080
as to whether as to how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many networks</font>

721
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,500
this policy proposal would apply to and

722
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,929
help it's also unclear as to whether

723
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,140
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the appropriate solution or if</font>

724
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:41,240
there's a architectural or technology

725
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:47,390
fix that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> applied and of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

the important discussion points that we

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,560
should talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here one is the very</font>

730
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:59,090
obvious one is this an important enough

731
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:03,770
problem to solve the feedback at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin 31</font>

732
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:05,389
was somewhat equivocal on that and I

733
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:08,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">think what it comes down to is are we</font>

734
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,350
going to have a broad enough solution

735
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,980
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply to other</font>

736
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,750
networks I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a number of</font>

737
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,600
approaches to solving it one of which

738
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:19,460
does exactly that which<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be to</font>

739
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,549
broaden the residential market area

<font color="#E5E5E5">section of the policy manual to cover</font>

741
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,190
existing devices as well as what it

742
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,929
currently covers

743
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,970
our homes this is the portion of the

744
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,409
policy manual which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recommend you to</font>

745
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:34,399
pull out and read or i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring it up</font>

746
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:37,790
on the slide that basically says for

747
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,859
residential ISPs that are serving a

748
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:43,190
number of homes in a region and have to

749
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:45,139
assign addresses to their equipment they

750
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:48,740
can assign those based on the number of

751
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:50,540
homes served by their infrastructure

752
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:53,000
whether or not those homes are actually

753
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:58,150
currently using their IP services so

754
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,500
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is classic cable policy the</font>

755
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,700
approach that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the author was wanting to</font>

756
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,790
take in his original version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

757
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:09,098
policy proposal i think is to do exactly

758
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:11,540
this to cover folks who have devices

759
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:13,819
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which are feature phones or</font>

760
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,099
smartphones that may not happen to be

761
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:17,720
using an address at a given moment but

762
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,069
if those devices are present on the

763
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,368
network that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply</font>

764
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:24,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same sort of fifty to eighty percent</font>

765
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:27,079
utilization ratio that the cable

766
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,750
networks can apply so that would be one

767
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:31,970
approach to solving this problem there

768
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,010
may be others we're still interested in

769
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:36,348
feedback from folks who may have ideas

770
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,400
and we're also interested in the

771
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:41,599
question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether we should move this</font>

772
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,210
forward or abandon it so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,650
existing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPM text which is also in</font>

774
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:49,210
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion guide and then I think</font>

775
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:51,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leaf the leaf this on a slightly</font>

777
00:35:51,770 --> 00:36:02,569
possibly address this and then I'll hand

00:35:53,420 --> 00:36:05,990
it over to Paul so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a I shall</font>

779
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:08,150
go back if I can find it I'd ask if

780
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,618
anybody has comments on this proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

781
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,390
think the most the first point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a</font>

782
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:15,079
problem that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AC should spend time</font>

783
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:17,390
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve and if you have a view</font>

784
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,680
on the approach that would be useful and

785
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,890
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is one that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

786
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,379
need some discussion on so don't all

787
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:28,790
rush up at once there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only three</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Mike's I know you guard much from NTT</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won the race go ahead sir perfect</font>

790
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:38,900
this this seems like a provider having

791
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:43,038
very short range

792
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:44,599
in how to architect their network coming

793
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron and asking them to change</font>

794
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,500
policy to work around their own

795
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,450
brokenness and I do not think that this

796
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,809
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that we should encourage</font>

797
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:59,359
people to do and therefore I do not

798
00:36:53,809 --> 00:37:00,890
support this not supported so first if I

799
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,240
may I<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna let Scott respond if you'd</font>

happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be one mobile provider that</font>

808
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,289
was mentioned I'm sure there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more</font>

809
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,118
that are impacted it concerns me that

810
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:28,369
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at changing the policy for</font>

00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone just to fix you know one</font>

812
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:31,700
person's issue especially when we're

813
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,859
already so close to the end of the line

814
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,558
for IP version 4 as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it stands today I</font>

815
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:37,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that you know the eighty to ninety</font>

816
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,529
percent number yeah that that's probably

817
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know pretty fair i like that</font>

818
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:43,069
suggestion there but instead in turn we

819
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,410
should be you know pushing these

820
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:46,640
multiple providers and the people that

821
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,920
work with the mobile networks that are

822
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">having issues you know as Lee you know</font>

823
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,510
presented earlier Android and Apple that

824
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,549
do not have ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> support yet properly at</font>

825
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,470
this time it really does need to be

826
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:58,970
rolled out in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not necessarily</font>

827
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:01,129
fix the problem because we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

828
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,990
dual stack is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way to go and it</font>

829
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,190
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even you know fix everything but</font>

830
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,899
you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would help alleviate</font>

831
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,480
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues so as it stands today</font>

832
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,589
due to this being such a small focused

833
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,420
problem I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that it's</font>

834
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:12,828
necessarily a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to proceed so</font>

opposed I'm opposed to yeah thank you

sir next speaker or on<font color="#CCCCCC"> kamari Google oh</font>

837
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:23,240
and probably what's the first I actually

agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jared so I take it you're</font>

843
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:39,410
because i don't see the point in doing

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this first to bring up</font>

845
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:45,890
the the cable subscribers issue that

00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:49,609
that was done for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a specific case</font>

847
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,379
where we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment of the the</font>

industry that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had no come</font>

00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:59,150
troll over its own architecture and we

850
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:02,119
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fruit because income incumbents</font>

851
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,039
were forcing other organizations into

00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:05,269
the incumbent architecture and it was

853
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,450
the others that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to solve</font>

control over their architecture you know

that they can find a better<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to solve</font>

861
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:30,649
this problem I think so opposed yes next

872
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,920

00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,880
the registry system for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the distribution</font>

996
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:16,130
of globally unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet addresses</font>

997
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,369
and rules and guidelines and principles

998
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:22,760
for those distributions of number

999
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:25,670
resources that current work that John

1000
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:29,390
referenced has left some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

1001
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:35,000
principal terms out at this stage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

1002
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:37,848
development and so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barbados at at our</font>

1003
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,829
last public policy a meeting there was a

1004
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:43,780
suggestion that perhaps there ought to

1005
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:48,790
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy that recodified or</font>

1006
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:52,220
reintroduce those concepts in into the

1007
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:55,910
number resource policy manual of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

1008
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:59,980
so that's what it intends to do to

1009
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:05,089
express those same principles that were

1010
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:10,339
codified or expressed in 2050 into the

1011
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:13,279
NR p.m. specifically it would create a I

1012
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:17,808
mean at this stage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process by the</font>

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:20,960

1014
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:25,220
discussion only that's what a draft

1015
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:28,309
policy does is help us make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we</font>

1016
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:30,200
have a clear policy statement so the

00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:32,660

1022
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:46,040
conservation that was in 2050 with a sub

00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:49,820
a bullet of documented justified needs

1024
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:54,110
that there is needs basis for allocation

1025
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:57,680
and assignment of number<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources that</font>

1026
00:47:54,110 --> 00:48:02,740
there would be support for hierarchical

1027
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:07,089
aggregation that again supporting the

1028

up in a concluding statement about

get your support or your comments

whether you support introducing this

1048
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:18,470
language so that everything I mean

1049
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:21,200
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NR p.m. the number</font>

upon these principles in the past

1055
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:39,790
policy like this similar to this if

00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:43,580
language is not introduced into the

1057
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:46,550
policy manual then the authors and

others<font color="#CCCCCC"> in support of this so far have</font>

1059
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,990
said then there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> no place to</font>

1060
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:54,259
point we won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to point back to</font>

1061
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:57,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">ooh 2050 because it will be updated</font>

1062
00:49:54,260 --> 00:50:01,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">there would be no place to point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font>

1063
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:04,820
that our processes and policies are all

1064
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:10,940
founded in these principles so that's

1065
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:13,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole point of this so any</font>

1066
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:19,280
discussion that you would have upon

1067
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:22,368
whether these kinds of principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1068
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:26,330
were originally expressed in 2050 should

1069
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:29,090
be expressed in the current public our

1070
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:32,210
number resource policy manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say</font>

1071
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:33,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the discussion that's been on the</font>

1072
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,110
list and there's been some hot

1073
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,560
discussion on the list a lot of that

1074
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:45,250
discussion has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been around whether there</font>

1075
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:49,190
is a needs basis anymore whether there

1076
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:51,530
ever was a needs basis in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past I</font>

1077
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:56,330
think you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1078
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:59,600
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is tangential to this to</font>

1079
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:02,799
the point of are these principles still

1080
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">the principles that we operate by and</font>

1081
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,880
should they be expressed somewhere we

1082
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,569
can point to those foundational

1083
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:14,869
principles when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people ask us how we run</font>

1084
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:20,180
errand and make policy and allocate

1085
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:21,590
number of resources thank you Bill thank

1086
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,440
you again for standing in for Chris on

1087
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:26,180
short notice as well again this is as a

1088
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,700
bill pointed out it's earth this

1089
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:30,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">policies earlier in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process so the</font>

1090
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,439
AC is just looking for feedback on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1091
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,990
to move forward with it and fall so as

1092
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,250
always I would ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to not as you</font>

1093
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:42,040
have previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> rushed to the</font>

1094
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:42,040
microphones just take your<font color="#CCCCCC"> time don't</font>

1095
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm can I make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first you did you</font>

1096
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,270
may go first there as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as you member</font>

1097
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:54,050
state your name and affiliation yeah

1098
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:56,060
Matt pound said Phileas yeah i agree i

1099
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:58,310
think that these are definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1100
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:00,710
general principles we've operated on and

1101
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:03,099
they should continue to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

1102
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:06,579
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important</font>

1103
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:08,829
post run out when we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

1104
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:10,299
with transfers and things like that when

1105
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:11,890
it's that much harder to get address

1106
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:13,930
space it's that much more important that

1107
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,700
that eats basis and things like that be

1108
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:22,180
maintained so yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a good</font>

1109
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:24,038
idea to do this thank you hello Matt

1110
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,019
Matt if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back John had a</font>

1111
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:28,359
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you can I ask a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

1112
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:32,979
because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being predicated on the</font>

change from 2050 to 2050<font color="#E5E5E5"> biss and that</font>

1114
00:52:32,979 --> 00:52:41,078
change there's goals in 2050 and there's

1115
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:46,390
goals and 2050 bits the language<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1116
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:49,119
in this policy proposal is not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1117
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:52,450
goals what's called principles in here

1118
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:55,029
but as actual allocation policy from

1119
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:59,979
2050 and I guess have you looked at 2050

1120
00:52:55,029 --> 00:53:01,539
bits to see what more since that's

1121
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:02,890
what's causing this change have you

1122
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:06,700
looked at the differences between the

00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:09,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">two I have not done a comparison of the</font>

1130
00:53:33,249 --> 00:53:39,069
watched a lot of the discussion and read

1131
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:44,680
over just the gold section not the rest

1132
00:53:39,069 --> 00:53:47,739
of 2050<font color="#E5E5E5"> biss I am a little bit skeptical</font>

1133
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:52,269
that what we have in this initial draft

1134
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:55,809
of the policy proposal is the type of

think capture most of what he is

1138
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:08,499
captured here I think what's left is

1139
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:10,239
more a description of current allocation

1140
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:12,669
policy than it is a statement of

1141
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:15,970
high-level principles there probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1142
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:18,790
a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher-level principles that</font>

1143
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:21,910
we don't have global consensus for any

1144
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:25,300
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the the move away from</font>

00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,609
face of ipv4 run out that might still be

1147
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:32,290
relevant for another year or so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">end region but i'm not sure that those</font>

1149
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:37,450
are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to codify in the</font>

1150
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:41,140
way that this policy proposal seeks to

1151
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:44,649
do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am approaching this skeptically</font>

1152
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think the the general approach of this</font>

1153
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:51,810
may have some merit but as evidenced<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1154
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:55,330
the heated discussions on PP ml and

1155
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:57,970
other things i'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

1156
00:54:55,330 --> 00:55:01,210
there yet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would encourage everyone</font>

1157
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:04,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and reread all of the</font>

1158
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:09,700
relevant documents and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

1159
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:11,740
about ways that we can actually do what

1160
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,080
I would call a gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis and find</font>

1161
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,700
what actually is left that still needs

1162
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,730
to be described and then have a

1163
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:21,399
discussion about what whether there's

1164
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:24,520
actually consensus on those gaps because

1165
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,349
I see a lot of the areas that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1166
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,900
described in 2050 being the contentious

1167
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:30,700
ones and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we have a</font>

1168
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,790
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus on what those should</font>

1169
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:37,149
be so I'll be interested to see how that

1170
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:39,160
plays out and I'm looking forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1171
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:41,940
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of editing and discussion on this</font>

00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">one I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's ready yet so</font>

1173
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:48,099
skeptically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a support over the direction</font>

1174
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:49,980
a I am skeptical<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the current text and</font>

1175
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:52,420
we'll see where it goes from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1176
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,700
other comments that would be useful to

1177
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,140
the AC we're again on this one I would

1178
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that we will probably just pass on</font>

1179
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:04,118
the verbal comments and not take a show

1180
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:08,099
since its new and seeing none in the

1181
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:12,040
room I'll just check with mr. Dorrit if

1182
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:13,480
closing the mics<font color="#CCCCCC"> three two one closed</font>

input to the AC thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

1185
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:30,849
and coming up on draft policy 2013 dash

1186
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:33,589
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> lir ISP and end-user definitions so</font>

1187
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:35,390
back in May this was submitted the AC

<font color="#CCCCCC">Shepherds Kevin Bloomberg Owen DeLong</font>

1189
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:40,460
and drum spre draft policy was adopted

1190
00:56:38,359 --> 00:56:42,049
as a draft policy of the AC meaning it

1191
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,510
was understood what it was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

solve the text is online and in your

definition of LIR ISP and end-user

1195
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:57,319
there's no similar proposals or

1196
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:58,880
discussions and the other regions it is

1197
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:01,400
still under development so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a staff legal assessment on it and</font>

1199
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:13,010
I'll turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over to Kevin I presume to</font>

to help define what an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet service</font>

over the last 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and so the</font>

1216
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:04,160
question is does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this change that we</font>

have here<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually change anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1218
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:11,149
does it just make a couple words look

1219
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:13,099
nicer and not solve what the original

1220
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:15,680
issue was so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go over that</font>

1221
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:19,490
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barbados which was actually cooler</font>

1222
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:22,160
than it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in New Orleans</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now the</font>

1223
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:25,069
we had a staff report that was done that

1224
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:28,100
brought up this issue there is no term

1225

1226
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:34,319
newer technologies don't necessarily fit

1227
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:37,350
into the word is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P it's kind of hard to</font>

1228
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:41,940
define what<font color="#CCCCCC"> an end user is or who an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

1229
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:45,630
is and what really the crux of it is is

1230
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:47,430
we have policy shopping so what's gone

1231
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:52,410
on is over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last three to four years</font>

1232
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:56,009
an end user is still at 12 months an end

1233
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:57,990
user has a / 24 is their minimum for

1234
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing requirements they have a</font>

1235
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:02,220
much simpler time of it because quite

1236
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,779
frankly and users are smaller there are

1237
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,439
less of them they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back very</font>

1238
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:09,330
often they have simpler needs they don't

1239
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,240
have to assign to their customers as an

1240
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:14,790
example and what has happened in the

1241
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,669
inverse is that ISPs in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

1242
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:20,640
definition have gone from 12 months to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're running we're going in</font>

1244
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:29,029
to run out things are getting more

1245
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult so by having a very vague</font>

1246
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:34,380
definition which has worked for many

00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:36,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">years it allows people to say no I'm an</font>

1251
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,450
what we're looking for or what I believe

1252
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:49,320
the author is looking for in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

1253
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:52,589
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help clarify so that there is less</font>

1254
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:55,140
ambiguity for staff and for the

1255
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:58,080
community as to what is an end user<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1256
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:00,720
what is an ISP now we could do it one of

1257
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">two ways we could try to define what an</font>

1258
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,339
ISP is and I've having spent enough time

1259
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:09,810
at nanog I would be very interested if

1260
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:12,360
we had 50 opinions on 20 people in one

1261
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">isp is but the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is for the</font>

1262
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,520
community as I see it is what is an end

1263
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:19,799
user can we define end user and leave

1264
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,970
the rest to the other category<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1265
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:27,810
that be acceptable that's one question

1266
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:31,680
opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to close to the group the other</font>

1267
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:33,870
question is if we do this we're going to

1268
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">be making some subtle changes to what</font>

1269
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:38,819
people have expected for many years web

01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">hosting company potentially that might</font>

1271
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:43,440
have been fine in the end user policy

1272
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:47,310
might not anymore they might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and vice versa so the the bar</font>

1274
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:52,590
will move will shift and what might have

1275
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,660
been one way will now be a little

the community wants in this area is

1285

thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin I think it's also worth</font>

1286
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:25,920
pointing out you know this definition

not not all sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> only affects the policy</font>

01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,850
under which an organization would under

1289
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:31,650
but also affects fees because we do

1290
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:38,549
charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> different fees there and whether</font>

01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:47,190
rapidly<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> microphone since</font>

1295
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:54,600
this is our last proposal so we might be

able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap a bit early and Jeff handle</font>

Louisiana State University I thought

1298
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:01,440
into the category of I don't know what I

may it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day so hold on one</font>

1303
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:15,720
second you're an<font color="#CCCCCC"> end user right now okay</font>

1304
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,700
if you ask me you we would say that your

1305
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,609
registration is an end user you pay

1306
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:24,689
lower fees than I asp's by the way for

1307
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:27,600
very very very similar services it is

1308
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:30,210
also true<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are some criteria</font>

1309
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:33,089
that are different<font color="#CCCCCC"> for end-users and</font>

1310
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:36,360
ISPs for obtaining initial and new

01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:42,090
allocations as we get towards the run

1312
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:45,480
out of ipv4 in the pool people will self

1313
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:47,400
select which criteria is most favorable

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's also true that someone who can't</font>

1324
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:11,210
more numbers and so we have the question

01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:13,370
of someone claiming do we worry about

1326
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:16,910
that or do<font color="#CCCCCC"> they self declare which they</font>

are got it does that clarify it a bit

1330
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:27,529
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth clearing up to see what</font>

1340
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,960
basically defining an end user as

someone who doesn't let's say I'm

assuming you're meeting us and slipping

1356
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:24,740
then be an end user John how would you

1357
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:30,459
interpret that under the under the

1358
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:35,029
proposed policy great if all you did was

1359
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:36,920
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet services and st.</font>

1360
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:38,780
Andrew's an organization receiving

1361
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:43,310
assignments few cents at work and does

1362
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:45,490
not register anyway assignments so so if

1363
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:49,490
you do not register any reassignments

1364
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:51,439
then you're an end user<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now it just</font>

1365
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:57,290
was wanting clarification on a thing

1366
01:04:51,440 --> 01:05:00,200
right I think actually I had Scott did

1367
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:04,070
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you okay for Mike</font>

1368
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:05,930
Garrett much<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntt though the one thing</font>

1369
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,870
that I noticed is that in this booklet

1370
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:09,779
that I was

1371
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:11,100
handed and thanks and thanks to the

1372
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,570
staff who put that together by the way

1373
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:14,549
they do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work to provide in</font>

1374
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:16,890
section 2 you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a definition section</font>

1375
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:20,010
yes we do you do you intend to define

1376
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:22,350
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is P is as an acronym that you use</font>

1377
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:24,990
throughout as you do similar acronyms

1378
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:29,310
here as part of this because I don't see

1379
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:31,890
the bootstrap problem right yes I think

1380
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good takeaway for the AC to</font>

1381
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:35,040
decide if they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for I think</font>

1382
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:39,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a good point out oh I'll see if I</font>

1383
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:41,220
can address that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acronym is P</font>

1384
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:43,740
expands to internet service provider

1385
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:47,069
that's in the text of the new 2.4 yeah

1386
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:48,350
it is right before sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand</font>

1387
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:50,490
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is</font>

1388
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:52,140
defining the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end user sites the</font>

1389
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:54,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">university who's not quite sure are</font>

1390
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,740
there in isp because they may have

1391
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:58,770
departments or other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> they may sub</font>

1392
01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:00,299
assign things to and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what not would it</font>

1393
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:02,490
be valuable to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there and it's</font>

1394
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:05,040
it's a question that I don't feel needs

1395
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:06,689
to be answered but it's just a question

1396
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,670
of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it makes sense to</font>

1397
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:10,440
enumerate that further to provide

1398
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:13,470
clarity so people don't try and drive

1399
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:15,270
trucks through holes I when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask a</font>

1400
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:18,180
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make sure I understand the</font>

1401
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:20,250
proposed text functionally defines the

1402
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:23,669
difference between an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and land user</font>

1403
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:25,860
you're suggesting enumerated certain

1404
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:29,520
types of organizations are one versus

1405
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:32,250
the other you're suggesting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

1406
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:36,860
includes a university universities are

suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that through the community</font>

1409
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:47,069
feedback process you it may be valuable

1410
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:49,110
if you further document that and and

1411
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,970
what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is that someone would</font>

1412
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:53,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to suggest text as to what</font>

1413
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:57,810
organizations end up in that enumeration

1414
01:06:53,670 --> 01:07:00,780
sure thank you over to Kevin Bloomberg

1415
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:04,470
first so just a quick question sorry you

1416
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:06,410
sat down is it easier to define ISP or

1417
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:09,540
is it easier to define to end user

1418
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:12,330
because my concern is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> P is a</font>

1419
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:14,759
very long term moving target that we've

1420
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:16,700
seen some I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my question for you is</font>

1421
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,940
is end user and easier

1422
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:22,220
term to define<font color="#E5E5E5"> then ISP or the six of</font>

1423
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:25,810
one half dozen of another thank you

1424
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:30,799
Kevin next Mike Matt pound said Phileas

1425
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:35,359
I think that if an organization that

1426
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:38,630
provides internet access is not defined

1427
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:42,109
as an ISP under this text that Miss text

1428
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:44,119
is broken and so in other words the

1429
01:07:42,109 --> 01:07:46,520
interpretation that John gave earlier

1430
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:50,030
you feel is<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest the text is broken</font>

1431
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:52,820
yes so okay I would agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I did</font>

1432
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:55,520
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> intend for msos to be classified as</font>

1433
01:07:52,820 --> 01:08:00,290
end users by the way Scott library and

1434
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:05,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron AC author of this text um simple</font>

1435
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:09,140
in full disclosure so my first off as

1436
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:11,960
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the policy text rational</font>

1437
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:14,060
whatever it is my organization is

1438
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:17,060
neither an ISP nor an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user by strict</font>

1439
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:20,540
reading of the current text because we

1440
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:23,540
are not primarily providing internet

1441
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:24,859
access and we are not exclusively doing

1442
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:29,960
it to our own equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> where some of</font>

1443
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:32,779
both I think it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clear up</font>

1444
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,549
that I'm neither thing I think it's

1445
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:36,230
important to tighten up these

1446
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:39,170
definitions a little bit I do not think

1447
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:41,778
it is important to lock down every

1448
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:44,690
single possible edge case as either one

1449
01:08:41,779 --> 01:08:47,480
or the other while there well Aaron

1450
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:49,399
staff likes to have things cut and dried

1451
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:53,269
in policy so that they can do their job

1452
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:54,649
more easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am inclined to put more</font>

1453
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:58,730
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them when it benefits the</font>

1454
01:08:54,649 --> 01:09:01,129
community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think having policy that</font>

1455
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:03,879
is a little bit flexible in this

1456
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:07,150
situation might be good now in in the

1457
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:10,100
well-known innumerable cases like

1458
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:12,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">universities</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> msos I think the text</font>

1459
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:14,270
should go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and be clear enough to</font>

1460
01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:17,960
make it unambiguous what those are but

1461
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:19,850
for some new cloud type service that is

1462
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:23,000
sort of like an ISP and sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an</font>

1463
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,950
end user I'm not personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> opposed to</font>

1464
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,560
having them be able to choose which

1465
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:28,608
policy applies to them and if the

1466
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,530
policies are so different that

1467
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:31,890
everyone's

1468
01:09:29,529 --> 01:09:34,389
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the wrong choice by some</font>

1469
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:37,360
definition then perhaps we need to look

1470
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:39,700
at that distinction and tighten that up

1471
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:42,069
but that's kind of where I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

1472
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:44,170
as when I wrote this text I think it

1473
01:09:42,069 --> 01:09:46,420
does need to be tightened up a little

1474
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:48,850
bit but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear feedback</font>

1475
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:51,010
from the community as to whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1476
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:52,540
think we need to explicitly define

1477
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:54,550
everything or whether it's okay to leave

1478
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:56,260
some ambiguity in here I think I've

1479
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:58,570
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of yeah we should work on</font>

1480
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:00,340
this steps so I think wow it's valid to

1481
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:01,540
hear the community I think it's as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1482
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:03,700
was pointed out<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier in the</font>

1483
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:06,040
presentation you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

1484
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:08,470
proposal came out of a staff report

1485
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,540
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> given it each one of our regular</font>

1486
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:12,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin means that staff have had struggled</font>

1487
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,510
with this so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if staff are</font>

1488
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:15,250
struggling I think it behooves us to

1489
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:17,470
discuss it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means they're</font>

1490
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:19,210
having a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it and their job</font>

1491
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:21,310
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to execute the policy that you know</font>

1492
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:23,710
the errant the community passes I

1493
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:24,940
believe the farm like was just like John

1494
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:30,640
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to add something my</font>

1495
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:32,320
apologies um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we can do</font>

1496
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,180
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so if</font>

1497
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want loose definitions those are</font>

1498
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:39,940
great and those work fine if you have

1499
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:43,840
two very clear definitions that says the

1500
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:47,019
world is made up of a and B but you've

1501
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,550
defined a and B very tightly you may

1502
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:51,730
find out there's a lot of sees that

1503
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:54,670
don't qualify for a or b so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1504
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:57,160
decide the philosophy here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if it's</font>

1505
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:59,290
that they can choose then it's pretty

1506
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:01,780
easy to have some light definitions of

1507
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:05,260
either we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1508
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:08,259
choose if it's that you want a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard line</font>

1509
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:11,500
to either be qualified as an end user or

1510
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:14,110
to be qualified<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an ISP that also</font>

1511
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,330
works as long as there's only one hard

1512
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:18,040
line that we're enforcing if we try to

1513
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:20,350
enforce too hard lines we actually end

1514
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,880
up with organizations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a or b or</font>

1515
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:24,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't mean either and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

1516
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem you face so the philosophy of</font>

1517
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:27,580
what the community wants is very

1518
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:31,650
important before you<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide which</font>

1519
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:31,650
definition structure you want to have

1520
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:36,220
far Mike first it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

1521

comment Jeremy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schmeichel from</font>

1522

<font color="#CCCCCC">integrator brought man I didn't mean to</font>

1523
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,460
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce a loophole it's</font>

1524
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:42,800
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know dude</font>

1525
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:44,719
the work that I do I work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on behalf of</font>

1526
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,550
several you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable MSOs that are</font>

1527
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,050
smaller and so that is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1528
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:50,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that springs to mind it's I want to make</font>

1529
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:52,160
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a clear definition to</font>

1530
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,540
a certain extent obviously because we

1531
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce all the Seas but</font>

1532
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,390
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a valuable</font>

1533
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:58,210
discussion and that we should definitely

1534
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:01,340
work together as a community to help

1535
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:03,770
come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those definitions Thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> You</font>

1536
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:07,480
senator mike was next<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt pound said</font>

1537
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:10,100
again yeah I I kind of feel like that

1538
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,259
that doing it by defining the end user

1539
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:14,239
might actually not be the easiest way to

1540
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:16,910
do it because the the thing that I think

1541
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:21,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're concerned about is the workload on</font>

1542
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:25,280
staff and the resource usage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> isps</font>

1543
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:27,950
there there the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> larger resorts train</font>

1544
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,830
right for both for both workload and and

1545
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:33,110
for number resources so that I think

1546
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:35,719
it's ISPs that we are concerned with and

1547
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:37,790
I think so it's probably easier and so I

1548
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:40,969
think that any organization that shows

1549
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:44,660
some isp behavior even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's not all</font>

1550
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:46,120
of what they do should be an isp so I

1551
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:50,150
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to define</font>

1552
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:52,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that then then to say people who do this</font>

1553
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:55,190
or this or end users and everyone else

1554
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:57,230
is an isp map<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually really</font>

1555
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:59,570
impressed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that little snippet I'm</font>

1556
01:12:57,230 --> 01:13:01,879
gonna have to use that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P behavior</font>

1557
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:05,840
rather than a specific definition yeah

1558
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:08,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually I think for me really</font>

1559
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,770
embodies what what this is about and not

1560
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:11,480
we be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

1561
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:15,680
who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sorry Kevin we broke the</font>

1562
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:17,330
wire Aaron AC so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean we</font>

1563
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,860
can probably get it down to a small list

1564
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:21,320
of things right people who provide

1565
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:24,230
Internet access to other organizations

1566
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:27,950
or two or do individuals right p and

1567
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:29,509
people who swip resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i</font>

1568
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:33,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">think even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just those two things would</font>

1569
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:35,810
probably cover 99% of them you know

1570
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:37,310
there might be one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two other simple</font>

1571
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:39,320
things we need we would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw in</font>

1572
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:41,900
there Ivan a lot about it for very long

1573
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:44,450
but but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be an easier</font>

1574
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:46,969
approach is to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here are things</font>

1575
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:49,809
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes that our isp behaviors</font>

1576
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:53,060
anyone who does these things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in isb</font>

1577
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:53,690
everybody else is an end user thank you

1578
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:57,160
and fairness

1579
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:59,540
just check with remote participation no

1580
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,860
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be closing the mic soon and</font>

1581
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,330
so that you're not thrown off<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1582
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:04,280
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a poll question as we've had</font>

1583
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:06,559
previously so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to input even</font>

1584
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:09,590
just to say get your two cents and

1585
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:15,080
please approach a microphone now closing

1586
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:17,390
microphones once twice three closed last

1587
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:19,969
question comment to you sir so Jake not

1588
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:22,130
clear from dying my my hesitation with

1589
01:14:19,969 --> 01:14:24,680
what Scott said is while it's very true

1590
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:27,320
you want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible confusion and</font>

1591
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:30,949
frustration don't lead to flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1592
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:34,250
guess by what I would envision is an

1593
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:36,650
applicant having to choose with the

1594
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:39,530
acknowledged of interpretation and then

1595
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:41,089
your staff this is back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forth where</font>

1596
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:44,540
it's kind of like so who's interpreting

1597
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:46,910
what so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question would be to</font>

1598
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:51,680
you especially directed at like staff

1599
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:54,139
interpretation is I'm guessing they

1600
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:57,260
probably want some some examples maybe

1601
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:59,660
maybe to Jarrod's point maybe and

1602
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:01,550
there's some kind of separate document

1603
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:04,670
that just gives examples and that's not

1604
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:08,390
tied into the to the bylaws or what

1605
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:10,730
whatever formal documentation work you

1606
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:13,100
know where we're solidifying here so

1607
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:20,349
that you have flexibility to adopt that

1608
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:20,350
over time thank you John yes

1609
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good</font>

1610
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:32,009
suggestion regarding having examples

1611
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:33,570
when we get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other end of this and</font>

1612
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:35,010
we know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rules are it would be</font>

1613
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:36,840
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so someone could</font>

1614
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:39,360
say oh I'm one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and that's</font>

1615
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,670
easier I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to raise an aspect now</font>

1616
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,170
and this might be worth this might

1617
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:45,650
reopen the topic it might encourage

1618
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:48,390
people to come to the microphones

1619
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:55,379
recognize that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron fee schedule</font>

1620
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:57,630
for isps is significant recurring annual

1621
01:15:55,380 --> 01:16:00,860
fees for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of resources and</font>

1622
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:05,640
the fee schedule for<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users is a</font>

1623
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:07,950
small maintenance fee each year and this

1624
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:11,400
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been the practice since Aaron was</font>

1625
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:14,790
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> with its inception so this means</font>

1626
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:17,700
that parties you know if two parties

1627
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:20,760
have a both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six / sixteens</font>

1628
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:22,950
and ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that end user and one is a isp</font>

1629
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP is saying several thousand</font>

1630
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:28,080
dollars per year<font color="#E5E5E5"> for eight thousand</font>

1631
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,850
volts per year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the end user is</font>

1632
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:32,670
paying this fee of a hundred dollars per

1633
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:34,800
year generally if people have a choice

1634
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:38,070
of paying several thousand per year or

1635
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:41,790
hundred dollars per year as much as

1636
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">their altruistic they choose to pay the</font>

1637
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:47,760
lesser amount and so this means that we

1638
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:50,160
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> careful because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if people can</font>

1639
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,600
self-select we could find ourselves

1640
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,430
having to face the financial

1641
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,160
consequences of everyone saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1642
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:57,660
actually getting the same services and

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just going to pay a lot less money</font>

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who feel that the answer to</font>

01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is normalize the services normalize</font>

the fees people who think the answer to

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is differentiate the services</font>

P versus end-user social selection

1651
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:24,180
conveniently somebody has approached the

1654
01:17:27,489 --> 01:17:34,039
is is this that big of a problem or if

1655
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:38,420
the fees are aligned is that going to

1656
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:40,728
present<font color="#E5E5E5"> a significant budgetary</font>

1658
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:47,030
if is if Wi-Fi if if the fees converge

1659
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:49,219
such that everyone is pain and

1660
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:50,809
relatively the same amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends</font>

1661
01:17:49,219 --> 01:17:54,289
which way they converge I guess but a

1662
01:17:50,809 --> 01:17:56,119
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users would become very upset</font>

1663
01:17:54,289 --> 01:17:58,400
and would look for the person who

1664
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:02,030
submitted that suggestion and hunt<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1665
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:04,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">down if yes but if it were to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go the</font>

1666
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:07,039
other way or did they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't it can't I</font>

1667
01:18:04,969 --> 01:18:10,070
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users are paying a hundred</font>

1668
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:13,340
dollars per resource wat record no no so

1669
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:15,170
anyway I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how the air and</font>

1670
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,820
budget stuff works perhaps that's

1671
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:18,079
through my own ignorance and because I

1672
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:21,349
don't pay a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention to the</font>

1673
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:23,329
process if all the ISPs stopped paying

1674
01:18:21,349 --> 01:18:26,539
their fees or start paying the end user

1675
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:27,920
fee well that how will that impact Aaron

1676
01:18:26,539 --> 01:18:31,550
eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of errands revenues or</font>

1677
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,709
ISP fees<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if the ISPs count fees</font>

1678
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:37,699
come down to meet the end user fees it

1679
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:39,170
would get interesting okay i think as

1680
01:18:37,699 --> 01:18:43,329
treasurer i would have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that would</font>

1681
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:43,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">put us in a serious position yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1682
01:18:43,659 --> 01:18:51,829
other people that would like to approach

1683
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:54,320
on this topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> center microphone i have</font>

1684
01:18:51,829 --> 01:18:56,749
to raise it a bit guarantee you speaking

1685
01:18:54,320 --> 01:19:00,380
for myself just<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was sitting here</font>

1686
01:18:56,749 --> 01:19:04,760
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future of enterprises</font>

1687
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:09,459
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users subsequent allocations you</font>

1688
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:13,280
six requests reporting requirements and

1689
01:19:09,459 --> 01:19:16,400
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will probably evolved over time</font>

1690
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:18,860
and users will probably require more

1691
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:23,170
resources from air and maybe you should

1692
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:25,219
pay some more fees or maybe not and that

1693
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:28,010
reporting might require things like

1694
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:32,719
slipping enterprises and end users might

1695
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:35,389
start looking more like ISPs though we

1696
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:38,599
should i would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are careful</font>

1697
01:19:35,389 --> 01:19:39,550
about language in what looks like an isp

1698
01:19:38,599 --> 01:19:42,280
means

1699
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:44,110
as we as a community have absolutely no

1700
