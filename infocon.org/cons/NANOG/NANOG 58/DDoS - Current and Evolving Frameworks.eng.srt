00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go over some statistical some</font>

far as d<font color="#CCCCCC"> das campaigns we're also going</font>

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,990
to cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple case studies of actual</font>

20
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:45,870

here d das has become a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

on the application layer side

we have our HTTP GET floods that is by

they're also used in combination with

other types of criminal activity like

you'll notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know on the left</font>

99

framework and there you know toolset

this one is the more impressive slide

and benchmarking border routers which we

142

all know can be weaknesses when it comes

to packets per second which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you include</font>

a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> other aspects as well that</font>

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:53,130
could be you know a little traumatizing

your map china now still is on top even

154
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,750
though we'll see a comparison between

<font color="#E5E5E5">three different time verticals that</font>

institution so we're growing as a

160

more that we grow the better view we

162
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,750
it's impressive and you know dangerous

at the same time on how globally scope

164
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,400

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,009
another number<font color="#CCCCCC"> within here that we like</font>

to bring up even though it's still kind

of a unity involving kind of like

centering point of botnet traffic but

175
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:11,139
Brazil's included within that however

176
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,300
there are five countries that we've

of all maliciously source traffic in

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,529
South America so more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,960
seeing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more malicious activity and</font>

181
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,580
more importantly now we're seeing

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain governments in these</font>

that there has to be some security

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,569
upgrades within their infrastructure so

187
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,329
here this bait essentially just a

188
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:43,599
comparison you know we have this last

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:43,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially so this particular framework</font>

211
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:45,550
you know does take advantage of the well

known vulnerabilities within web servers

213

so reaching out to that validating that

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,709
and actually cleaning and you know

215
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,190
sanitizing these machines is is

216
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:59,160
definitely a prior

it's the style at which they do that not

only building the botnets it's the

four or five different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of attacks</font>

250
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,550
you know there's reconnaissance there's

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:28,060
a you know there's a probing area

popular attack tool kits here sis thanks

259
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brian so this this toolkit is pretty</font>

260
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,020
weak on the global scale of things it's

261
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,819
not an amazing tool kit uses a typical

262
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,949
see to command and control architecture

263
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,050
where infected Windows host will call

264
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,720
back to an HTTP server to receive the

265
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,109
commands for attack now what's

266
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,149
interesting about this kid is kind of

267
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,160
comes up and goes down in popularity so

268
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,300
in the beginning we kind of saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font>

269
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,529
know the enterprise criminals running

270
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,349
this toolkit to attack different

271
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,269
competitor websites and then you know

272
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,250
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saw like kind of a change</font>

273
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,769
and we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this tool kit was using</font>

274
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,990
to attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> at faiz so f is for financial</font>

275
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:25,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">institutions were like with what's going</font>

276
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">on why is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the toolkit being used to</font>

277
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,709
attack us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we released some paperwork</font>

278
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,930
and some documentation on it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

279
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,219
see here you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's it's leaked</font>

280
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,680
out to the internet so everyone can

281
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,820
download it for free and use it

282
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,439
generally they're using dirt jumper<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font>

283
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:44,300
now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and you know it's it's not</font>

284
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,589
it's very powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a windows button</font>

285
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,510
it but it's not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you that</font>

286
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:50,420
high like you know bandwidth but it

287
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,370
still will cause complications to right

288
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,069
now smaller financial institutions just

289
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,240
recently we worked a case where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

290
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,579
a financial institution was attacked

291
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,230
they had their network architecture kind

292
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,640
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss configured so that when their</font>

293
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,880
website was getting attacked actually

294
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,550
their land traffic was affected so

295
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,990
here's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a run-through of what the</font>

296
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,719
attacker would see as he's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

297
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,420
running through issuing an attack to

298
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,550
these different organizations so you

299
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,699
start out here and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just hit the</font>

300
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,099
page comes up with a 404 it's a fake 404

301
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,140
you can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of identify it through</font>

302
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,940
different md5 s and you can even track

303
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,540
different versions by the md5<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

304
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,800
response if you cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a section of it</font>

305
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:34,310
if you enter<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you know the admin dot</font>

306
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,290
PHP with the proper URI header you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

307
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,089
login page and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one it's set up</font>

308
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just admin which is the default from</font>

309
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:43,760
the leak kit so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can login admin</font>

310
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,829
password pretty pretty slick security

311
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,769
setup over here it might be a banana

312
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:50,300
what are the two out that's password so

313
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,490
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what they see it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple</font>

314
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,890
the Russian toolkits generally are

315
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,050
pretty simple like this they don't like

316
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:59,480
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have these fancy kits there's some</font>

317
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,829
funny talk you know like on the forums

318
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,660
about how they don't care about images

319
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:04,189
and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you just enter in</font>

320
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,069
the URLs and then the type of attack

321
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,089
you'd like to run and for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you</font>

322
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,860
know he's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> four different attack</font>

323
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,870
types and v5 they added<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one</font>

324
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,180
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an anti d das feature but it's</font>

325
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually not included in the binary so</font>

326
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,020
it goes out to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function in the program</font>

327
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,689
that's not set up so it'll just crash

328
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,579
your bot

329
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:24,519
now it was popular about this one was

330
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:26,199
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was effective in the way that it</font>

331
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,970
handled resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than the</font>

332
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,329
previous popular kit which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Optima or</font>

333
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:34,000
darkness it was capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of generating</font>

334
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:37,029
very fast application attacks from a

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,529
Windows host it's written in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delfy like</font>

336
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,950
most of the Russian<font color="#E5E5E5"> toolkits as far as</font>

337
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:43,959
the binary is concerned um but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

338
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,089
it on the grand scheme of things it's

339
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,709
not very powerful from for the c2

340
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,700
perspective yes but when you're looking

341
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the different button and</font>

342
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,540
architectures for what's better or

343
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,200
what's worse you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

344
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,420
would see larger attacks in in kind of

345
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,910
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> booter shells or the the</font>

346
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">stressors as a call so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

347
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,449
were interested in actually querying

348
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,980
this botnet the c2 to see you know who

349
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,440
you're attacking you can hit this image

350
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,760
gif file and you'll actually see the

351

instruction come back which is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

355
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:24,610
and then call back every hundred twenty

356
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:26,319
seconds targeting this URL so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

357
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,640
to let David<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of run into a little</font>

358
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of the British campaigns which is</font>

359
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,430
those puter shells and the stressors

360
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:35,949
that we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about yeah it's a</font>

361
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,479
30 minute slot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i apologize if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i run a</font>

362
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:39,069
little bit quicker<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some of the slides</font>

363
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,480
i just want t to get into some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

364
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,750
later work that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on a</font>

365
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,040
particular case so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bro das this</font>

366
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,440
is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual campaign that we had</font>

367
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,839
against an enterprise organization we

368
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,959
did a case study on this you know this

369
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty sincere i'll show</font>

370
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,040
you the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide which is so some of</font>

371
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,109
the attack attributes behind them was

372
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,760
cool well in one section here we

373
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,620
basically have maliciously source

374
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,540
through our dcs to your graphically

375
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,370
located so you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the the</font>

376
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,029
malicious traffic is actually traversing

377
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:11,890
into our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> about over 70 a little</font>

378
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:15,010
over 75 gigabits per second just in

379
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:18,459
Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone and this attack campaign</font>

380
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:21,100
right here had three different attack

381
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:23,410
vectors syn flood UDP flood DNS look a

382
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,589
kind of over 130 gigabits per second

383
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,899
over 94 million packets per second some

384
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:30,339
destination ports related to the attack

385
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,769
types that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> utilized within this</font>

386
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,739
particular campaign

387
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:37,379
some of the campaign characteristics

388
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:40,449
included what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to validate</font>

389
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:43,209
within the botnets included over a

390
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,589
thousand compromised web servers these

391
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,868
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of machines that had</font>

392
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:48,609
mentioned before the most popular forms

00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:51,339
of infections for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and machines are</font>

394
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:55,179
utilizing WordPress and Joomla please

395
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:56,739
patch your servers eval scripts which is

396
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,988
a method of actually running it which is

397
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:01,809
the attacks are executed in memory

398
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:04,329
therefore it makes it a lot harder to

399
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:07,059
track basically on basic logging

400
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,709
mechanisms within that this second

401
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,039
campaign I just like to bring up was

402
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:14,589
it's another attack that was specific to

403
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:17,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">bro das itself not nearly as big but the</font>

404
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:22,958
geomap so we first were tracking this

405
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:25,418
this botnet in<font color="#E5E5E5"> November of 2011 highly</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these are all newly identified</font>

409
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,269

410
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:35,710
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this botnet activity and all</font>

00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:37,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> campaign's we've seen on the source</font>

412
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,570

servers maximizing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of bandwidth</font>

on hosting provider fighters bulletproof

415
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,710
networks and so forth originally it was

416
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:50,289
like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you see a clear</font>

417
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,120
picture of how distributed this botnet

418
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,590
is and the infections and the

419
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,500
concentration in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United States</font>

420
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,389
itself which wasn't the case before so

421
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,159
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of movements and inside</font>

422
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:02,678
adidas it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about mitigating</font>

423
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,510
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side as well and the</font>

424
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,889
infection process and the botnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

425
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,690
way it builds and the framework in which

426
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:10,479
is runs is important to actually

427
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well these were all non</font>

428
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,690
spoofed obviously as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about</font>

before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all fingerprinted</font>

essentially through detection systems

that we have particular to this

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,289
it off this quick slide and then pass it

on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Terrence so essentially booter</font>

there's a couple ways of doing this from

you know an application perspective when

there's two right here one is you know

00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,519
more complicated where they'll actually

00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:15,479
chose it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of its style in this</font>

this this mid

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:55,260
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntp servers and then get this this</font>

578
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,240
reflection we released tools to kind of

579
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,040
test this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gauge the rates of</font>

DNS reflection come on talk a little bit

587
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:18,270
about terminology here so we we classify

588
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,560
the attacker as the malicious actor he's

589
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,510
the source that's spoofing all the

590
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,700
traffic and then we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> our victims</font>

591
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,750
and their primary targets so you can

592
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,940
kind of see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our attacker</font>

593
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,830
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> our victim name server name</font>

594
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,850
servers and then we have our primary

595
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,929
target and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know two campaigns you</font>

596
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,149
know the primary target<font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually</font>

597
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,950
be the victims itself or the primary

598
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,320
target itself but this makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier</font>

599
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,090
for kind of explaining it or talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

600
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers when you're saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you're</font>

605
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:55,590
testing traffic to you so in 2012 the

606
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:59,910
largest one we saw was 42 gigs it was

607
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:01,350
definitely third of what we saw to the

608
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">borough's campaigns or the stressor</font>

609
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,000
scripts but it was still admirable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

610
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,320
mean 42 gigabit per second attack can

611
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,920
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> down a lot of infrastructures you</font>

612
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,320
know one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the neat things with DNS</font>

613
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,860
reflection if used properly is you know

614
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,689
you have a DNS flood well give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a UDP</font>

615
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,490
float essentially and you've got a UDP

616
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,690
fragment flood and then all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

617
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're querying that aren't online</font>

618
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,720
again

619
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,940
enter you know your tools are messed up

620
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,770
be getting an ICMP flood and then you

621
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,060
know the attackers would like to throw

622
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,070
in things like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kitchen sink and then</font>

623
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,629
throw like a flood at you as well during

624
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,679
this specific campaigns which was

625
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:38,810
highlighted here now recently we we

626
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,590
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a DNS reflection attack</font>

627
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:45,070
that 167 gigs to our infrastructure and

628
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:48,020
I got the graphs right here to prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

629
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,750
this one was interesting we've seen this

630
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,150
before they used a texture in any

631
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,130
requests I don't we didn't we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

632
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,290
access this chap in<font color="#E5E5E5"> memorial day so we</font>

633
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,020
don't haven't seen the request yet but

634
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,780
the if you look here it's very small but

635
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,370
you can see see the cursor here so up

636
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">here you've got that the question and</font>

637
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:09,199
then down over here you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the</font>

638
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:12,260
response so the response<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like 3,900</font>

639
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,810
bites and it was you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just random</font>

640
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,640
text data kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

641
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,429
sequence or like a copied and pasted it

642
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,740
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflected you know the traffic</font>

643
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,990
off of this now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was very effective</font>

644
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,280
um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't know if they</font>

645
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,330
compromised the server and honor if

646
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,879
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to found it through</font>

647
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,159
their querying of DNS servers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net</font>

648
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,920
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've reached out to the specific</font>

649
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,570
site that that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> T for Deborah com</font>

650
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:41,000
which is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a camping site in</font>

651
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:43,669
Amsterdam or something like that and we

652
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,370
were able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify 784 host through</font>

653
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">net flow we sample at 10 or 11 thousand</font>

654
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:51,409
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't able to get you know the</font>

655
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,380
37,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts you know these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

656
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:57,260
posting these lists but 763 of those had

657
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,820
recursion enabled so this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been kind</font>

658
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,400
of a big push for us to kind of clean up

659
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,649
than that we every time we get these

660
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,270
large campaigns<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will capture</font>

661
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,400
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IPS will publish them to</font>

662
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,570
different security list two different

663
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,490
starts to get the stuff cleaned up

664
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,200
because you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we're in</font>

665
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the business of DDoS mitigation we're</font>

666
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,890
not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business of causing problems</font>

667
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,629
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so the best thing we can</font>

668
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:22,450
do is get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information out to people</font>

669
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:26,000
and share it so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the graphs</font>

670
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,650
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything small but we were took</font>

671
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,690
about 90 gigs actually in one data

672
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,370
center<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this dinosaur flexion and</font>

673
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,520
that was your London pretty much because

674
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:37,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have our best peering over there</font>

675
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,800
the distribution of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the botnet was</font>

676
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,409
heavily concentrated in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font>

677
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,450
States again and if the targets are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

678
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:47,050
the US the attackers will prefer to

679
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,490
actually use hosts in the US and this is

680
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:50,080
kind of that distribution grab you know

681
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:54,190
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said have really concentrated in</font>

682
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the US and then as well as in Asia so we</font>

683
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,030
also queered the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host for different</font>

684
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:02,980
versions to see whatever what they were

<font color="#CCCCCC">running a bind on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top but Microsoft came</font>

686
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,410
in a pretty distant second which was was

687
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,629
interesting also you know power<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

688
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,460
recur sir d nice masquerading there's

689
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,370
some fun ones here you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

690
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,110
their version set to a smiley face some

691
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:20,739
guy was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about a doctor's license</font>

692
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:22,209
over here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then just nope so the</font>

693
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,690
other thing we did with these hosts was

694
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,940
um some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have had SNMP open so we</font>

695
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,500
wanted to graph it and see what one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

696
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,380
these servers actually looks like on the

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">net as far as bandwidth is concerned so</font>

698
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:38,020
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran it just a small sample set just</font>

699
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:40,570
on to the servers um we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran an SMP</font>

700
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,950
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> four other interface statistics and</font>

701
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,040
their incoming and outgoing bandwidth

702
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:48,250
and packets per second and what we saw

703
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">was nothing crazy I mean one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

704
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,430
hosts wasn't putting out 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> Meg's</font>

705
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,890
although actually well this one was it

706
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't put a like gigabits of traffic</font>

707
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,380
but you know the reflections weren't

708
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,590
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> there kind of in the numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

709
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,870
we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> so uh you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you see here on</font>

710
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the top one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was probably this this</font>

00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,530
server was probably limited in bandwidth

712
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,760
into what he was taking and then on the

713
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,010
bottom one this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,250
amplification as far as what the actual

716
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,550
server was receiving inbound and

717
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,950
outbound but you know really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

718
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,649
his outgoing max was was 104 megabits

719
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,110
per second as incoming max 100 so these

720
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,160
servers aren't I mean the sample set has

721
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be larger we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this</font>

722
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a larger perspective but I'm really</font>

723
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious to see you know if they're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really getting the amplification that</font>

725
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,790
you know we're able to get in the labs

726
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,320
kind of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world so I concludes</font>

727
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,280
our presentation I'd like to take any

728
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions if anyone has any</font>

729
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,590
hi Phil Rosenthal from is crime so we we

730
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:59,459
also obviously see DDoS attacks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

731
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:01,620
network and the nature of the attacks

732
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,710
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past few years has certainly</font>

733
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,080
changed we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are getting attacks</font>

734
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,090
much less frequently but when we get

735
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,760
them they are you know more

736
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:15,000
sophisticated larger I assume you're

737
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,220
seeing similar patterns but that's not

738
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,470
my question but what is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

739
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,350
question is we've recently seen a trend

740
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:26,690
where the attacks are actually dynamic

741
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:30,059
in nature where you know say the attack

742
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:32,220
comes in very small the customer isn't

743
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,379
filter they get say a gigabit of attack

744
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,200
it takes out their server the attack

745
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:40,760
goes away the server you know recoverers

746
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,919
attack comes back we apply a filter and

747
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,169
you know the upstream is now 10 gigs the

748
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,030
attack increases to 10 gigs takes it

749
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:50,220
down we move the filter or further back

750
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:53,010
and the attack you know then gets larger

751
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,169
and you know then at that point you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

752
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,669
we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more capacity to it and</font>

753
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:58,830
eventually a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days later they give up</font>

754
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it goes away is that similar to what</font>

755
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,070
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are seeing as well now I</font>

756
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,799
wouldn't say recent I mean we've seen

757
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,350
that for many years specifically it we

758
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,809
first saw it in kind of the gambling

759
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,610
market um can you talk kind of to what

760
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:14,100
region your customer base was in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

761
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:18,360
one or because it kind of so we see that

762
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:20,969
to a couple different regions o our

763
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,439
customers are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever okay yeah</font>

764
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,590
so we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know um</font>

765
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,630
definitely with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the higher class of</font>

766
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:29,639
criminals that will call them um you

767
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,010
know we first saw it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia where a</font>

768
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,630
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacks are being you know</font>

769
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,250
source from there or started to be

770
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,110
sourced from there and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

771
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,120
we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out of the Middle East</font>

772
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:43,520
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent attacks to the different</font>

773
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,520
financial institutions thanks

774
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,139
erik oster<font color="#E5E5E5"> mother say oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was wondering</font>

775
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,270
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys could give a little insight</font>

776
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,370
on some of your mitigation strategies

777
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,139
like you guys some do scrubbing or do

778
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,479
anything more like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> UV flows back</font>

779
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">ACL is that kind of stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

780
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,710
essentially i mean our<font color="#E5E5E5"> proprietary</font>

781
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,520
techniques obviously we can't disclose

782
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:09,620
but from the grass before so we have for

783
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,180
global scrubbing centers and essentially

784
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,669
they're just cleansing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> malicious to</font>

785
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,100
production traffic and just depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

786
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:18,140
the particular type of attack we have

787
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,879
set you know different mitigation

788
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,190
controls in place to mitigate against

789
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,890
that attack simply cleanse it and then

790
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,690
release<font color="#CCCCCC"> the production traffic so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

791
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,760
know it's it's it's not just about

792
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,820
mitigation but it's also about false

793
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,370
positive rates so we try to stay is you

794
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,710
know on top of fingerprinting and

795
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,600
evaluating<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you know not</font>

796
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,600
concentrate so much more on like black

797
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,870
holing<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate limiting type of technique</font>

798
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,990
itself and then the human intervention

799
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:50,239
has something to do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well just</font>

800
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the previous gentleman's question</font>

801
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,220
these attacks are dynamic based on

802
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,810
operations that are existing so it's

803
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,270
essentially as if you're playing chess

804
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,310
they're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-four/seven we're</font>

805
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,260
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-four/seven unfortunately</font>

806
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,320
there is not automated technologies that

807
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,370
are actually dynamically learning and

808
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,050
validating you know those<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

809
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,639
things so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

810
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,490
intervention involved both in the

811
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,650
attacking side and the mitigation side

812
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,780
yeah and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I'll add to and when</font>

813
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,300
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to DDoS mitigation sometimes</font>

814
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,920
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> is better you know not enforcing</font>

815
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,090
every single policy but enforcing the

816
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,400
one that election me to get the attack

817
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,020
will let<font color="#E5E5E5"> your gear work harder at maybe</font>

818
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,510
getting the you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS attacks</font>

819
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,850
and not focusing on everything else so

820
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is one thing that you know from a</font>

821
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,850
network perspective or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ids</font>

822
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,080
perspective or a mitigation device

823
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,570
perspective that's one thing I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

824
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,580
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well so yeah that last part if</font>

825
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,560
I could just fall real quick so did you

826
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,000
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of these tools any more or less</font>

827
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,929
sort of useful in different scenarios or

828
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,640
is it kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're saying</font>

829
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,440
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like different different attacks</font>

830
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,150
call for different strategies or in

831
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me I don't want to dig out special</font>

832
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,260
sauce<font color="#CCCCCC"> sized one or two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years it does it</font>

833
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,660
no no no that's totally cool um ya know

834
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,730
it's just it's based on attack type and

835
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vector in which their attack</font>

836
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,940
his security controls are in place for

837
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,409
those so certain like you know an<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL</font>

838
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,889
post-flood is going to require a

839
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:12,950
different mitigation strategy than say a

840
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,179
UDP flood so you know it's understanding

841
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:16,428
all the different attack types of

842
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,379
vectors in which there and Terrence is

843
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,629
right lessons more in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways you</font>

844
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:22,250
know over mitigating layer on security

845
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,109
controls actually create more false

846
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,668
positives fingerprinting and dealing

847
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:26,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">with what's in front of you and don't</font>

848
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:32,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">worry about the rest is probably your</font>

849
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:34,428
best strategy Thank You Jake McClure

850
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:36,980
from done what are the top three

851
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,720
categories that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see you get attacked</font>

852
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,869
you specifically said gambling and

853
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,089
curious what<font color="#CCCCCC"> else uh so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking</font>

854
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:46,730
about industry verticals yeah India yeah

855
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,440
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends on the time of year it</font>

856
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">depends on a lot of things it depends on</font>

857
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,820
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at that time and I'm</font>

858
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,139
currently I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have those numbers</font>

859
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,210
