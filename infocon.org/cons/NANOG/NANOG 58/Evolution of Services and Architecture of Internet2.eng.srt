1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:09,000
so next up we have at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Edward ballast and</font>

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,679
Chris speier's who can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,599
evolution of services and architecture

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,730
and internet too we made reference to

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,160
our any<font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday and join text and</font>

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,800
those guys are a lot closer to these

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,170
networks than we are but in reality if

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,170
we look at how these guys are using

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,330
technology you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably are</font>

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,980
one of the largest users of 100 gig at

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,250
this point there are definitely the

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,380
largest user of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN who talks about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,269
they use it publicly whereas a lot of

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,969
the other users<font color="#E5E5E5"> of SDN technologies</font>

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,160
don't talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at all and so it's a</font>

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:47,090
great pleasure to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,089
of stuff in this in this forum<font color="#E5E5E5"> so thanks</font>

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,640
hi hello my name is Chris speier's I did

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,890
network planning for internet too I'm

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk briefly about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture and really the evolution</font>

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,860
of the underlying infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,810
the past decade decade and a half and

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,460
then pass it off to my colleague at

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,630
ballast who will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about one of the</font>

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,139
interesting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're really</font>

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,020
doing on one of our networks so this is

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">a real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brief primer on what internet too</font>

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,920
is if you don't know we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> national</font>

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,810
research education network around the

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,310
time that the NSFNET was being

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,840
privatized a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of research</font>

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,240
universities got together and said you

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,090
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need a network that</font>

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,460
serves our needs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got together</font>

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,509
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> formed internet too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,640
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what a research Network</font>

38
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,920
actually is other people have done that

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,200
from this very stage in 2011 Kevin

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oberman from yes net gave a very good</font>

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,159
presentation include the length there so

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,530
you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at his overview</font>

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,540
of research networks boils down to a

44
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,630
different set of needs among researchers

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,790
scientists and not just big data but

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,439
more big science as a real driver for

47
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and of course you can get more</font>

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,689
information at the link below so I put

49
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,039
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide together to try to give</font>

50
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,469
an overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how things have changed</font>

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,640
and evolved over time with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

52
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and you know it's a little</font>

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,380
fuzzy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in places but</font>

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,810
I think it gives a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea a good</font>

55
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,790
overview of really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> change that's</font>

56
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,170
happened over time and there are two

57
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,260
major inflection points there where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

58
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:26,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> major architectural changes and I'll</font>

59
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,570
go into detail on those in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a moment</font>

60
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,429
so IP services everybody has like heat

61
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,810
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well we've had just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

62
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,170
before unicast but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font>

63
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,000
multicast in v6 since 1999 when we had

64
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">our first OC 48 network we had a</font>

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,570
partnership with qwest where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

66
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,480
launched our first nationwide backbone

67
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:46,450
we upgraded that to see 192 sees later

68
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,970
and then 10 gig and then the first big

69
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,739
inflection point came we partnered with

70
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,109
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and infant era and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

71
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,660
deployed a 13,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> route mile network</font>

72
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,460
around the United States on a single

73
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,970
hundred gig dtn layer on the infinera

74
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,800
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gave us a ten by ten hundred</font>

75
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,470
gate capacity throughout the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,720
that allowed us not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go beyond</font>

77
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,970
just single 10 gig in turn ugly so we

78
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,890
got went to 20 even 30 gigs in between

79
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,960
certain nodes but allowed us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

80
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,390
remaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that remaining capacity to</font>

81
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,070
try out different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to build out</font>

82
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,350
different networks to try different

83
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,760
topologies and really see what we could

84
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,709
do to support research in different ways

85
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,600
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even actually set up a peering</font>

86
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,180
service that runs say that many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room actually care with</font>

88
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,470
the the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> big inflection point came</font>

89
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:35,260
in 2010 when we were the recipient of an

90
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">ntia broadband technology opportunity</font>

91
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,269
program grant and in 2011 we began

92
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,790
building what is now our current optical

93
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:47,410
infrastructure and that has ordered

94
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:50,709
allowed us to to scale over an order of

95
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:53,440
magnitude of what we can actually do and

96
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,690
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build out so the optical</font>

97
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,340
network that we have today is almost

98
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,260
16,000 route miles of dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber</font>

99
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,900
throughout the country we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 50</font>

100
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,190
optical a<font color="#CCCCCC"> draw facilities and hundreds</font>

101
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,620

105
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,350
so we can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 gigs on on 88 channels</font>

106
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,880
on any internode a drop link we have

107
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,760
directionless capabilities in our metro

108
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,010
areas and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did something very unique</font>

109
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,750
here and this is something very unique

110
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,510
to the research and education community

111
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,520
we partnered at a very basic level with

114
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,510
in the common optical infrastructure and

115
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,280

116
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,950
deeply with them on this and that has

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,989
allowed us to drive 108 penetration we

130
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,510

131
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually deploy the 40 gig MUX ponders</font>

layer 0 and layer 1 you know this

143
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,680
network has allowed us to evolve quite a

144
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,870
bit more and as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> we partnered very</font>

145
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,180
heavily with es net so their

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,490
infrastructure rides over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

147

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> on fiber infrastructure but we also</font>

148
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,590
provide back on services for any way

we couple ourselves with our are any

<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't really see in other areas</font>

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to actually runs a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

170
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,889
its own networks and some of the other

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,870
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'll say this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Jeanne is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those things that's a</font>

00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:18,370
closely with the genie project office

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,520
the first internet T network that we

built<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was sort of s the end was a</font>

187
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:26,949
that we built on OC one IDC rings

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,620
throughout the the country this is on

189
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> n Funaro substrate and it was</font>

190
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,159
programmable and that you could dial up

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,039
circuits on demand OC 12 if you want to

192
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:38,020
do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and just build on</font>

country between researchers we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

195
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,878
merged that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to our IP and mpls later</font>

196
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:48,029
when that<font color="#E5E5E5"> got robust enough and we built</font>

197
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,310
in we call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to on-demand</font>

198

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,779
demand mpls to the wires with guaranteed

200
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,759

201
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:59,680
capacity between one research on another

202
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,449
they could actually dial that up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,550
the Oscars IDC protocol this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter</font>

204
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">domain control so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could actually get</font>

205
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,830
it from a lab all the way to another lab

206
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:09,969
so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really allow these researchers do</font>

207
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,589
things they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do before it made</font>

208
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:13,120
networking simple right and that's what

209
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,219
it's supposed to be because that's the

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,740
only way<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to use it we</font>

211
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a nationwide 10 gig open</font>

212
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,169
flow test but that we have deployed and

213
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,639
I think we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out early 2011 and</font>

214
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,599
the real sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> centerpiece right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

215
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,250
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

216
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,740
about this is our advanced layer to

217
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,990
service and that is our nationwide

218
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,149
hundred gig backbone today they're 18

219
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,750
nodes deployed that's a mix of brocade

220
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:38,360
mlx u16s and

221
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">redmax 1960s and by the end of this</font>

222
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,400
summer Thank probably September time

223
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,870
frame will have 25 nodes deployed

224
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,079
throughout the country all connected at

225
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:52,220
100 gig and this network was built as an

226
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,050
open exchange this is the sort of glossy

227
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,580
map but it gives good representation of

228
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,969
our fiber footprint throughout the

229
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,850
country the layer 2 and layer 3 nodes on

230
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,440
the network are not quite representative

231
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,200
again this was put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together by our</font>

232
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,270
marketing people but that's the

233
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,500
underlying fiber infrastructure so yes

234
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,000
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> built on top of that know is</font>

235
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,550
built on top of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to network</font>

236
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,230
should built on top of that this is the

237
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> networks so this is our</font>

238
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,550
layer to our layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 our pairing service</font>

239
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,900
our international connectivity these are

240
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,689
the things the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> itself runs</font>

241
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,910
and not our partner networks so while

242
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,350
long ago we had just an IP network that

243
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,230
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lemnos connecting</font>

244
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">bios c48 we've grown quite a bit just in</font>

245
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,390
what we operate our shelves over the

246
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:39,800
past decade and a half and with that

247
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:41,330
hand it over Ted<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so some of this</font>

248
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,180
time to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of a</font>

249
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:48,860
follow-on to some of the demos we did at

250
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,839
the nog lab down in Orlando much what's

251
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,550
the same there's some additional data

252
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,770
about availability what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to cover</font>

253
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,500
today though so Chris kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talked</font>

254
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,569
about the history of SDN and covering a

255
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,030
variety of different networks from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hopi</font>

256
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,740
to ale to s and really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

257
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,300
touch on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just as to show you</font>

258
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,800
know the key thing we're striving for is

259
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">this idea of programmatic network</font>

260
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,060
control whether it be at layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 2 or 3</font>

261
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,430
you know we're trying to figure out

262
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,959
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have good touch points what's</font>

263
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,910
saying and what we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it for our</font>

264
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,920
customers and the motivation really

265
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,199
comes down to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we really want to</font>

266
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,510
give the members the ability to directly

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,370
create communication pathways between

268
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,780
their research facilities or they're

269
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,360
super computing sites whatever it might

270
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,620
be we want to remove ourselves from the

271
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,690
critical path in terms of provisioning

272
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,670
delays so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to call</font>

273
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,050
the NOC that kind of thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

274
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">general with any of these kind of things</font>

275
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be cognizant of</font>

276
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,050
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> related to quality and control in</font>

277
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">terms of you know when we talk about</font>

278
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,920
control it's a matter of don't burn<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

279
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,189
network by adding some feature that's

280
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,750
just irresponsible right and the major

281
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,780
use case for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this notion of</font>

282
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,400
national exchange fabrics and the idea

283
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,930
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give our customers</font>

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">not have to go through our IP network if</font>

286
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:05,329
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered suitable right so</font>

287
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,470
internet too and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> well love our</font>

288
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,580
marketing people they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea</font>

289
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,800
what they call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font>

290
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">innovation platform this really</font>

291
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,750
constitutes the the AL 2 s network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

292
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,820
what we like to affectionately call it

293
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,770
the key ingredients for this really are

294
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,810
big pipes so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a hundred gig with</font>

295
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,460
minimal aggregation so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

296
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,739
have elephant flows they work well with

297
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,120
hundred gig that's the idea there but we

298
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,940
also want to combine that with an open

299
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,100
networking stack that in some way

300
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,800
provides an ability for non vendors to

301
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,940
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of innovate that's one of the</font>

302
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,620
concerns we have with traditional

303
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,530
approaches is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the defenders control</font>

304
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,180
the pace of innovation right and we also

305
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,470
want to encourage domain experts to get

306
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,760
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the process of creating</font>

307
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,100
these new services and I'll get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

308
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,410
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the other key ingredient</font>

309
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,570
really is technical means to separate

310
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">experimental network research from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">production research traffic in a minute</font>

312
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,510
but our<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal is really you know to recap</font>

313
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,250
on the objectives here are to improve

314
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,439
the experience for there are any users

315
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,480
so you know those users include<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

316
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,010
that do network research and do

317
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,810
dangerous things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also involves</font>

318
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,790
people doing fundamental science<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

319
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,079
are moving large<font color="#CCCCCC"> data sets and we'd like</font>

320
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to have those to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co-exist</font>

321
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and ideally what we want to do is</font>

322
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,860
find a way to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to fill those</font>

323
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,720

discovery not on sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logistics</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of data movement the enable is for us</font>

326
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,770
right now we are and have been looking

327
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,290
at open flow 100 we are eager to see

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do with 13 but in general</font>

329
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,930
you know we're not we're not really sort

of partisans here any decent

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,370
get a hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that will help us we're</font>

333
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,500
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to entertain right so the</font>

334
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,390
platform itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> has three main parts as</font>

335
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,370
a test lab where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about eight</font>

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,840
switches and six pcs interconnected with

337
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,339
a MEMS device that we can do

338
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,959
programmatic control the

339
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,569
apology and we use something called

340
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,758
Jenkins to do sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of test automation so</font>

341
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:00,498
as we bring in new applications or

342
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,089
services into our environment we first

343
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:04,160
bring them into the test lab run them

344
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:05,779
through their paces there from there if

345
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,579
they graduate out that go into the ndei

346
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:10,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an older network we</font>

347
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:13,370
built a few years back with five nadp

pfft 820 switches these are open flow

349
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,120
switches they're configured in a ring

350
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,430
and at the 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig network the key here</font>

351
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">is we can do at scale sort of prototype</font>

352
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,959
testing of new services and we can

353
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,540
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> then route a live traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> onto</font>

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,339
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see how it reacts to sort</font>

355
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,559
of stress testing and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there if</font>

356
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:32,269
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great we move on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,620
ale to us network which chris already

358
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:38,389
described and today at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we</font>

359
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">have one major production service which</font>

360
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:42,079
is this thing called OSS and this

361
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,899
provides those sort of end user

362
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,719
controlled point-and-click provisioned

363
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,459
pseudo waters so we demoed this last

364
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,980
year at the dog lab are excluding the

365
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,300
last nanog and so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to believe at</font>

366
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,360
the point too much but but they're

367
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,248
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key of this service is that</font>

368
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,689
it represents us implementing something

369
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:02,269
in open flow that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had already been</font>

370
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:04,730
implemented in the ion service so it was

371
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:07,819
an existing use case it was dead simple

372
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,370
and we knew our community<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted and</font>

373
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:12,019
needed it so what this allows them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

374
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,249
is they can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this application and</font>

375
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,410
they can configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> suit of wires</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

376
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:18,350
any endpoints that they or their agreed

377
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,089
upon sort of partners need and they can

378
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,730
provision a pseudowire net at two in the

379
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,889
morning they can specify the path that

380
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,149
click go in a second later they're

381
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:27,740
forwarding traffic they don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

382
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:30,620
call the NOC they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even step a</font>

383
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,449
maintenance window where they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

384
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's instant gratification right so</font>

385
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:37,639
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the idea of OSS so one</font>

386
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,929
of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it</font>

387
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,699
quickly was what the innovation platform

388
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,730
is not so I know there were a lot of

389
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:45,529
questions at the last at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last night</font>

390
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

391
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:50,029
thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not is it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

392
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,139
playground we're fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk-adverse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

393
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:52,910
much as you can be with such a

394
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:55,939
technology I mean I realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so it's</font>

395
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:58,399
all relative right but we do encourage

396
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:59,719
responsible experimentation but the

397
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">process to get things into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our network</font>

398
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually fairly involved it's a</font>

399
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">three-step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process as I described</font>

400
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,040
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really inclined to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

401
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,650
let anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there and with a wild</font>

402
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">hair idea the idea is that we we truly</font>

403
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,890
take manage risks right and so there's a

404
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,440
process behind that that we use to

405
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:18,530
mitigate the risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's also not just</font>

406
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,090
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> test fit we do at scale operation of</font>

407
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">open flow apps you know so the OSS</font>

408
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,290
application is something right now one

409
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,680
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its primary use cases today is for</font>

410
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:30,530
customers that do backhaul into the into

411
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,969
the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 service and those customers</font>

412
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,310
are pushing greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 gig at times</font>

413
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,620
and they depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

414
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,109
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a production quality service and</font>

415
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,210
in you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are of course other</font>

416
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,200
other uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it for instance creating</font>

417
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,460
pseudo wires for other experiments but

418
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,170
you know we know there are risks and

419
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're trying to manage them and that is</font>

420
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:54,650
never a perfect thing but we do the best

421
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,270
we can right so when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what</font>

422
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:00,650
happens next so we have this OSS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

423
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,300
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's controlling the switches</font>

424
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,699
so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually run multiple</font>

425
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,410
different applications and this gets

426
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,200
dicey right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this notion of</font>

427
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,449
multi-tenancy we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really create a</font>

428
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">dedicated production</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and a</font>

429
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,410
dedicated sort of research network so we

430
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to have a network that supports</font>

431
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,120
both use cases because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

432
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">money to do both independently and so</font>

433
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,540
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want to do is figure out</font>

434
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,540
a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a production platform</font>

435
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,680
that can provide you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

436
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:31,219
multi-tenancy capability ously we can

437
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,890
build some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a you know virtual</font>

438
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,300
networks on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

439
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,550
able to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple applications on</font>

440
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:41,020
this network and we also want to not

441
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,219
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust these applications right</font>

442
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,900
much in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same way that if you had a</font>

443
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,610
server and you wanted to create virtual

444
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,770
machines that you provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers</font>

445
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,970
what we want to be able to do is to our

446
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,860
community members that provide virtual

447
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,170
networks almost like think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a</font>

448
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,030
ver<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine steroids where they they have</font>

449
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,520
full open flow control and they also

450
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,110
have topologies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot but we can</font>

451
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">just give them that basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

452
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,410
virtual network and let them run their

453
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,730
own applications on it or in our case it

454
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">might be multiple applications we</font>

455
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,880
ourselves develop so the approach what

456
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,440
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down too early for us is using</font>

457
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,600
familiar constructs so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

458
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,169
provide access control policy based on

459
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,539
switch port

460
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:20,809
VLAN tag these are all very familiar and

461
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:22,249
layer 2 and simple things right and so

462
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,309
in the open flow world they call<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

463
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:27,739
slice so our goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create slices on</font>

464
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,080
this network using things there's an

465
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:31,609
application called flow visor<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might</font>

466
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">be something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you provided to do slicing</font>

467
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:35,269
with we're also looking at other things

468
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">but for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us the key is to have non</font>

469
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:40,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">overlapping flow space so that we can</font>

470
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:42,470
avoid having one application disrupt

471
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,590
another application that's controlling

472
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,609
the network one of the major concerns as

473
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,899
we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this and getting more</font>

474
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:50,330
serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this of course is notion</font>

475
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:53,059
of traffic engineering in where that

476
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,369
occurs so where we're at in the

477
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,359
multi-tenancy space is at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point is</font>

478
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:58,100
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at figure out how to</font>

479
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,320
implement will be doing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trials</font>

480
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,959
and whatnot with flow visor but we're

481
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,129
also exploring other options including

482
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
writing our own sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow space</font>

483
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:08,149
firewall but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then also figuring out how</font>

484
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,769
this might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using the junction things</font>

485
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:13,998
like overlay networks to provide the

486
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:15,980
appropriate level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of simplicity right so</font>

487
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:17,389
when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to getting those domain</font>

488
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,929
experts involved also there's a program

489
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:23,539
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> juniper sienna and</font>

490
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,679
brocade have cooked up where if you guys

491
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,840
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've got an awesome idea</font>

492
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,929
how to help engineers move are assuming

493
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,668
scientists move data on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> l2s network</font>

494
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:33,529
go to that URL and you can win<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

495
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,710
money if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're willing to you know give</font>

496
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,539
up the Giga of the the code a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

497
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,809
so it's a program we're trying to

498
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:43,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">encourage people in our community to to</font>

499
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually put them skin in the game and</font>

500
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,549
get emotionally invested and actually

501
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,139
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with those solutions right and</font>

502
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:50,509
figure out a way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> helping people</font>

503
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:52,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">discover things that's really what this</font>

504
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:54,649
is all about so what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

505
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:57,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the issues and</font>

506
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:59,389
lessons learned this is if you google

507
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,699
sad monkey this is what the cutest

508
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:03,799
picture I could find it's not all sad

509
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,590
monkey but it's been an interesting ride

510
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:10,070
and so the first thing I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

511
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:12,230
talk about availability and so for the

512
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,668
last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months what we have and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

513
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,539
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also preferences i</font>

514
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:16,340
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's different the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that most</font>

515
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">people report it this is the total</font>

516
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">availability including disruptions</font>

517
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,609
during maintenance windows just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems</font>

518
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,979
like a more absolute sense of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

519
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:26,269
disruption<font color="#CCCCCC"> there aaliyah's and on the</font>

520
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,720
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of our circuits these</font>

521
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">under geek circuits</font>

522
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,559
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-nine point nine six percent</font>

523
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,299
availability right now in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last six</font>

524
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,840
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then for our nodes we're at</font>

525
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,710
99.25 so I dug<font color="#CCCCCC"> into those numbers a</font>

526
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit there's a couple things that</font>

527
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuck out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on me I stuck out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me the</font>

528
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,590
first was that you know in terms of our

529
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,720
note availability we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

530
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,129
instances where for instance we had a

531
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,200
single instance where we had 25 hour

532
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,690
outage over a weekend and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

533
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">nodes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a result of a</font>

534
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,520
sort of a combination of bugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

535
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,230
switch implementation in the controller

536
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,600
that caused it to basically stop

537
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,010
forwarding things correctly and do the

538
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,178
way we were monitoring things the only

539
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,370
thing to presented itself to our network

540
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:08,070
operations center was an ISS adjacency

541
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,120
alarm so this sort of prolonged the

542
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,668
outage because it was sort of

543
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,830
misdiagnosed which was I'll get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

544
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,929
minute but basically lesson there is you

545
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,760
know it's tricky to make sure you've got

546
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,169
the right level of monitoring and the

547
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,900
right level training and this is sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

548
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:24,179
a you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sort of a growing pain there</font>

549
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,950
a little bit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then on the circuit</font>

550
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,390
front there are two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

551
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,760
really contributed to those numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

552
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,799
I saw the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we are for some</font>

553
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,840
vendors having some hundred Giga optics

554
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,220
issues where the circuits flap

555
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,600
periodically and so that's contributing

556
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,610
to the lack of availability the other

557
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,189
issue is there's been a lot of code

558
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,240
upgrades on our optical systems as they

559
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,190
go through that these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

560
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,289
disruptive so I would assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

561
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:50,880
two things will subside as we get a

562
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:52,830
handle on those so vendor issues you

563
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,090
know everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> talks about open flow and</font>

564
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,860
how it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve all the world's</font>

565
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,389
troubles and you know it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

566
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,639
potential and is day<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointed out it's</font>

567
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">got you know you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask yourself if</font>

568
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,929
you're using you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hammer to hit a</font>

569
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,000
screw right but let's say you're hitting

570
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,200
us a nail with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hammer and you're</font>

571
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,880
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say well how's the hammer going</font>

572
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,039
to fail me so a couple issues where this

573
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,510
has sort of been pain points for us so

574
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,549
that the first is that for some vendors

575
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,830
they don't they don't fully support the

576
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:18,360
10 spec so they may match in layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

577
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,270
mode or<font color="#CCCCCC"> in layer 3 mode but they don't</font>

578
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,559
do both right other vendors don't have

579
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,570
proper barrier support so that

580
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,418
complicates the controller to switch

581
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:29,580
communication and then yet other very

582
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,530
other vendors also have issues with not

583
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,149
supporting all actions and hardware so

584
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,470
while it might do the right thing it

585
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,690
might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it at scale so</font>

586
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,669
your performance envelope changes

587
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,890
drastically right and then of course

588
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:43,260
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> all vendors you see a variety</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

589
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,120
of stability issues as their code

590
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,340
matures I'm not going to any details but

591
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,939
you can imagine the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff bleeding edge</font>

592
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,169
so we find interesting things right but

593
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the performance issue this is one</font>

594
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,110
that's that I think you know Dave touch

595
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,159
on a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about that the round</font>

596
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,679
trip<font color="#E5E5E5"> times or whatnot there's another</font>

597
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,390
issue here too which is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

598
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the from a black box perspective the</font>

599
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,530
switch implementations aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

600
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,780
performance right so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance we've</font>

601
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,970
seen some vendors where the time it

602
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,920
takes them to notice internally that

603
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have us a link that's gone down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

604
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,310
the tump they actually start sending the

605
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:18,300
packet to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the controller is on the order</font>

606
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,530
of 1.5 seconds that was quite shocking

607
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to all someone discovered that we've</font>

608
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,590
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to the vendor and they</font>

609
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,830
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very attentive at resolving that of</font>

610
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,030
course the next issue we have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

611
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,100
about all vendors have a limited

612
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,720
capacity for processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the instruction</font>

613
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell it how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change the forwarding</font>

614
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,490
state so these are the modified<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

615
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,290
messages or flow mod colloquially and

616
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,820
for those many of the vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

617
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,379
interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they're</font>

618
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,000
constrained to about a hundred flow mods

619
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,260
per second or so so you can imagine

620
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,540
we're probably a couple orders of

621
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,360
magnitude off of what a what many

622
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,889
internal systems can do and then the

623
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">last dish we've got is a total</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

624
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">supported rules these are ranging</font>

625
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,740
anywhere on average from<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 2,000</font>

626
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,230
4,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact depending on which vendor</font>

627
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,670
you look at so so obviously how you use

628
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,920
this is going to be fairly narrowly to

629
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">strain until they get that changed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

630
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,940
these are all things that of course the

631
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:09,060
vendors are working on quite rapidly

632
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,040
right so on the protocol front there's a

633
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,659
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch on first</font>

634
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,690
is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 spec isn't the best</font>

635
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,280
written spec you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great start</font>

636
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the issues that left a lot for the</font>

637
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,690
vendors to interpret so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

638
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,370
major problem we've seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next is</font>

639
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,920
there's a variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> of areas where hasn't</font>

640
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:28,379
do s risks so for instance there's no

641
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,180
real decent ways to do limiting between

642
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,920
the control and switch in terms of

643
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">packet in their packet outs there's also</font>

644
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,640
not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of built-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

645
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,290
with tablespace exhaustion so there's a

646
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,940
there's no way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the controller for</font>

647
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,740
instance to pass the switch how big is

648
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,120
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> table to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't push</font>

649
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,190
too many rules and fill it up and have

650
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,500
an unpredicted things occur after that

651
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,600
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course the 10 there's</font>

652
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,280
a bunch of features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't exist</font>

653
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,280
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all actually things resolved</font>

654
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,560
in 13 that make it difficult for us to

655
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> services we have today and so those</font>

656
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">things include I really no viable means</font>

657
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:02,729
for doing qls no TTL decrements you

658
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,740
can't mimic routing and there's no push

659
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,380
and pop of eel and tags and pls tags or

660
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,140
ppv tags so so the result is doing your

661
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,990
pseudowire kind of kind of thing becomes

662
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,270
sort of complicated right and then of

663
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,530
course today you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's touchdown by</font>

664
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,540
day which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the round-trip time</font>

665
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,940
required whenever you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to react to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

666
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,379

<font color="#E5E5E5">where you place your controller and</font>

668
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,550
whatnot you there are some complications

669
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:29,130
there there are some features in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 113</font>

670
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,270
spec specifically the fast failure

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,960
report groups which should help with

672
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:36,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in some limited cases so testing in</font>

673
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,670
the last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

674
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,379
working with the vendors very it's a

675
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,360
very active<font color="#CCCCCC"> and intense interaction</font>

676
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,980
right now that we have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we're sort</font>

677
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,290
of in that that bleeding edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

678
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,230
still and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a new version</font>

679
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,159
of code from a vendor from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves we</font>

680
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,780
have to basically put it through a full

681
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,930
system test and so in the last six

682
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:57,000
months we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do 6 release tests</font>

683
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,550
for vendors and each one of those of

684
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,100
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 20 to 50 hours of engineer</font>

685
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,960
time for applications there have been

686
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> four releases that's about 30 to</font>

687
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,440
40<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and then we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also been</font>

688
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,969
looking at flow visor testing for

689
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,830
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> leases it takes about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 to 50</font>

690
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,870
hours the variability there depends on

691
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:16,050
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we see a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bugs or</font>

692
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:18,360
whether the release is fairly clean so

693
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,590
in all in all that ends up being<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

694
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,270
fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our time is spent</font>

695
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:26,250
helping the vendors and about you know

696
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,960
from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my engineer standpoint it</font>

697
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,510
takes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty percent of my</font>

698
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,990
engineers<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to actually it's been</font>

699
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:36,120
consumed with this testing so the lesson

700
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned for us there is you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever guess of how much is going to</font>

702
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,370
take in terms of testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have need</font>

703
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,010
to double it you know the classic

704
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,570
software concept but you know the thing

705
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">we failed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to appreciate when we went</font>

706
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,470
into this is that when you go into the

707
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">SDN world you also taking on the</font>

708
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,280
responsibility of being the system

709
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:55,979
integrator and that really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part</font>

710
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,080
where it's forced us to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of</font>

711
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,920
raise our game but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

712
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,679
know our estimates on effort where

713
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,210
a little bit off right so in terms of

714
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> management never so if you're going</font>

715
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy your own sdn</font>

716
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,520
solution with open flow there's a couple

717
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,350
things going to be be cognizant of in

718
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,950
our case our management network is the

719
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:17,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">OSC channel across the GW m system and</font>

720
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,340
so if there's a fiber cut not only what

721
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,540
caused the topology change on our open

722
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,760
flow based network but it's also going

723
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,670
to impact the management<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and so</font>

724
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically this means that we do use fail</font>

725
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,930
secure which so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a failure we</font>

726
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,190
basically black hole traffic across that

727
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,590
link but everywhere else it continues a

728
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,120
forward but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue is you know your</font>

729
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,409
convergence there is going to block on

730
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,389
your management<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> convergence so you</font>

731
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,950
have to really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

732
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,300
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the part add a touch on</font>

733
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,890
also which is distributed<font color="#E5E5E5"> controller</font>

734
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,899
architectures can't help potentially

735
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,220
right of course you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

736
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,050
do some routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols sort of</font>

737
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,890
replication conceptually to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

738
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:53,300
get those features so if you are

739
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,400
considering writing applications that

740
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,520
you know my general sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of old man rent</font>

741
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,260
would be the robust when capable apps or

742
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,000
can be kind of hard right especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

743
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:04,340
the deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> restoration and topology</font>

744
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,050
discovery there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are reasons why for</font>

745
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,260
instance when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I GPS needs upz</font>

746
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,909
keep separate right and i do question at

747
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,950
times whether or not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of</font>

748
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,530
future when apps actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

749
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,660
full control of the interior path across

750
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,580
a network for instance you might be able

751
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,410
to just abstract that away and present

752
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:24,110
these applications with a simplified

753
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:27,050
backplane kind of construct right but if

754
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,490
they do if they do need to have control

755
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,050
of the interior path you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

756
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,280
yourself you know you trust the people

757
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,889
writing those applications to do your

758
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,720
traffic engineering and if no<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

759
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,890
to think about how are you going to

<font color="#CCCCCC">constrain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth how are you do</font>

yourself going to do traffic engineering

762
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,250
and you know so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep those things in</font>

763
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,450
mind also<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep in mind what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

764
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,430
to do about network management

765
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,340
disruptions and restoration performance

766
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:51,020
you know all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you know there</font>

767
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,610
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety of different ways there's</font>

768
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,830
all about trade-offs between performance

769
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,830
cost and complexity and you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

770
00:27:54,830 --> 00:28:00,110
of testing time so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future challenges</font>

771
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,370
for us are we want to work together with

772
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,649
the community whether it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the are any</font>

773
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,290
community or the broader sort of nanog

774
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:08,210
community to figure out better ways of

775
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:10,330
testing open full applications and

776
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,860
creating better passing regiments

777
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:15,649
we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

778
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,260
our hands on a viable 13 implementations

779
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,420
because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of features there</font>

780
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,490
that we find exciting and then in

781
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,170
general we you know one of the

782
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenges I see is that we really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

783
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,760
to find a better ecosystem in terms of

784
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,490
finding controllers that that are truly

785
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,690
distributed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense of they can</font>

786
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,490
abstract the way the difficulty is a

787
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,400
message passing between them to sink

788
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> state right and then of course</font>

789
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,850
finding standard northbound interfaces

790
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,530
that don't lock us and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

791
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,639
something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's an open area so</font>

792
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,170
these are the interfaces that an

793
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,000
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> developer would use related</font>

794
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,640
to the controller not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> openflow spec</font>

795
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,500
itself and then lastly the thing for us

796
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at is our refining our</font>

797
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,770
operations capability talked about sort

798
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">of misdiagnosis and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot and in</font>

799
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,280
general the the how do you monitor and

800
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,290
how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you troubleshoot an open flow</font>

801
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,180
application or excuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> me an open flow</font>

802
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,860
based network is much more complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

803
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,030
your traditional networks which have had

804
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,409
years and years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> years for us to</font>

805
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out what the craft interface it</font>

806
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,860
should look like and what those

807
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,030
procedures are so we're still working on

808
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,669
those procedures and coming up with best

809
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,410
practices internally and then also

810
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,030
relates to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open you know the</font>

811
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">operations support team structure people</font>

812
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,720
talk about DevOps you know we're running

813
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that right now we've got a set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

814
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,780
dedicated developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we got a set of</font>

815
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,090
dedicated engineers and they work

816
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,350
intimately together but still

817
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,530
organizationally there in two different

818
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:32,209
groups and then lastly there's this

819
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,340
issue if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to go out to win</font>

820
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,330
multi-tenancy you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cognizant of</font>

821
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,720
where you're going to do traffic

822
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:40,220
engineering and how you can have the

823
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,750
appropriate level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of infrastructure</font>

824
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,730
control without causing undue

00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,170
disruptions upstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> t of the</font>

826
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:49,580
applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be running on</font>

827
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:54,430
top of you so so that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

828
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,429
you also any questions

829
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,990
Dave Meyer broke a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ul um has wondering</font>

830
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,389
you mentioned flow wiser and all the

831
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:13,049
slicing stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering if you</font>

832
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,789
guys had<font color="#E5E5E5"> it been doing any work on 13</font>

833
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">because for those folks who don't know I</font>

834
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:18,419
kind of mentioned this in passing but

835
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,039
basically in 10 there was a pretty

836
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,559
pretty well defined and well-understood

837
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:24,480
notion of what a flow is so the flow

838
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:28,049
space idea is built on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right right</font>

839
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,490
in 13 you don't have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

840
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:32,039
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious if you guys have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

841
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,600
looking at that or yeah so I've been

842
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:36,179
looking at some I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a couple</font>

843
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,389
things that of consideration you know

844
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:42,779
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mind you know at one level what</font>

845
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:44,490
we are attempting to do is keep the<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

846
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:49,049
slicing paradigm as simple as possible

847
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:50,580
so I having a general arbitrary slicing

848
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:52,549
across the entire flow space i think is

849
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be exceptionally difficult</font>

850
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,520
constraining it to say we're going to

851
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,890
limit things to be just certain VLAN

852
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,929
tags might be a solution in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideal</font>

853
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:03,480
world what we would do is basically you

854
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:06,149
know present an overlay<font color="#E5E5E5"> network somehow</font>

855
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that we can hide the complexity in</font>

856
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:09,330
sort of mimic and give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

857
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,460
presentation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an entire flow space</font>

858
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,779
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to slice it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a way</font>

859
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:17,640
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application would need to know</font>

860
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:20,250
about last question Jacob act like i'm

861
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,679
done i'm curious how you decide where

862
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:26,159
your egress points will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

863
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:31,470
to two primary internet service to

864
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,919
egress to other providers there isn't so

865
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,990
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually run a very constrained</font>

866
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,309
network so that most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our provide most</font>

867
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,600
of our connectors actually have come on

868
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:43,289
the internet connectivity on their own

869
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,149
and internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> too is a separate Beijing</font>

870
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:46,590
favorite as a private network that can

871
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:47,850
interconnect with other private networks

872
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,189
that are research networks around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

873
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:53,309
globe the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I asked as we saw major</font>

874
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:56,880
influx and DNS coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

875
00:31:53,309 --> 00:32:01,350
appeared to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to space so I</font>

876
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,700
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious what we can talk</font>

877
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,779
offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was curious what that might be</font>

878
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,919
attributed to it was in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ashburn area</font>

879
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:09,230
yeah we definitely are about how fine we

880
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,740
do have peering connect

881
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:15,190
they're in ashburn so okay thanks thanks

882
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,190
very much guys
