1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:20,520
morning Cisco Systems focusing mostly on

2
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:25,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the high end routing so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,439
part of a two-part station bgp 101 focus

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,259
on bgp techniques for is peace<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,570
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is more the music the second</font>

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:40,969
part is the applicability how its

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:43,050
applied at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of session will post</font>

8
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:46,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">well across the slide deck so i will be</font>

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:50,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to access it feel free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask</font>

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:56,309
questions but just step into the mic and

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:01:00,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can ask questions so on the</font>

12
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:05,250
first session the beach p101 we will

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,200
discuss first bgp basics and then we'll

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,950
discuss the scaling techniques and how

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:17,000
comments are used in BGP second section

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,670
the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> section will focus mostly on</font>

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,240
how bgp is used in is peace and in

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,740
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will also discuss some peach</font>

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,740
be security-related features

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,970
so on the BGP basics first we'll discuss

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,040
what what bgp is and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,720
attributes the different attributes of a

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:48,820
BGP route that is and the path selection

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:51,490
algorithm and how different policies are

25
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,759
applied with bgp using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

26
00:01:51,490 --> 00:02:04,060
attributes and we will discuss finally

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:06,850
the HP capabilities so bgp as you all

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,750
know is a routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> protocol it is used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

29
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:13,750
exchange routing information between

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:16,120
different networks networks here is a

31
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,870
loose term so in this case considered

32
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,420
networks to be collection of routers and

33
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:28,540
systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are administered by a</font>

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:31,708
single entity it is exterior gateway

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:35,769
protocol so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> between different</font>

36
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:40,660
networks instead of within<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network it</font>

37
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">is described in RFC 471 and there are</font>

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:49,019
other several<font color="#CCCCCC"> other RFC's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still with bgp</font>

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,018
but RFC portal meant one is the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:20,019
first one is internet domain routing

the security aspect of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp and later on</font>

51
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:38,290
we discuss one aspect of that protocol

52
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,040
that features that focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the security</font>

aspects of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:51,579
autonomous system is the basic or the

corner of<font color="#CCCCCC"> p-gp autumn system describes a</font>

00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:05,860

58
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:10,069
uniquely identify that specific network

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,310
entity may have multiple organ system

63
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:28,300
numbers because of mergers acquisitions

64
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,300
and so on

65
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:40,380
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same number is a collection of a</font>

66
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:45,030
collection of entities routers and

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:48,290
networks that that are the same internal

70
00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:01,740
typically use a single routing protocol

71
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:04,260
inside that network but it's possible in

72
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,720
some cases to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some some service</font>

73
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,300
providers use multiple routing protocols

74
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,910
and then they use bgp to to bind those

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,720
multiple routing protocols particularly

76
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:20,490
if your network is large that's that's

77
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,250
possible but in general the core part of

78
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,580
the network always runs a single routing

79
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,550
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if it is a large network a</font>

81
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:39,240
different routing protocols and then

82
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:41,159
aggregated via bgp for internal use it's

83
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,250
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> autumn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stems usually under a</font>

85
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,990
is possible that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single entity may</font>

86
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:55,950
have multiple autonomous system numbers

87
00:05:47,990 --> 00:06:01,470
because of again mergers acquisitions it

88
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:04,349
is identified by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 page number but</font>

89
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,349
since we are running out of that to

90
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:10,320
update number<font color="#E5E5E5"> four of the eight number</font>

91
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:14,580
is introduced and now you can have for

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,380
updates on a system number and<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon it</font>

93
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,960
will be very difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get at to</font>

94
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:23,969

96
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:30,470
the product 8sn was introduced by RFC

97
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,469
4893

98
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:46,520
so the two octet<font color="#E5E5E5"> ranged obviously from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

99
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:53,189
to 65535 which is to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> park</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 16-1 and</font>

100
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:56,869
for update starts from<font color="#E5E5E5"> two 65536 up two</font>

101
00:06:53,189 --> 00:07:07,769
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power of 32 which is up number</font>

102
00:06:56,869 --> 00:07:14,189

103
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:17,610
so it cannot be used once roost 4495

105
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,389
used for the public internet internet

106
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,330
and then there are a couple of blocks

107
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:30,539
for documentation and there is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> block</font>

108
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:33,659
for private use and then there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">plain number but it's possible to</font>

121
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:19,639
express into a dot format as well

123
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:30,050
so the older mr. numbers are distributed

124
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:33,978
by arrives or the richest race the rich

125
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:37,840
trees you can in some case you can also

126
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,840
get them from upstream service providers

127
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:47,870
so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here from the current</font>

128
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:51,530
two octaves of the system number more

those numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are current out of today</font>

155
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:35,280
the one that you saw so beachy basics so

156
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,730
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in this particular example</font>

157
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,510
there are three different networks and

assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these three different</font>

and you see those s numbers even though

in this documentation you are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100</font>

163
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,560

that you know particularly if you are

168
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,490
don't want people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy place this end</font>

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:30,210
networks s-100 s 101 and 102 so there

173
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:32,630
are feelings between ultimate systems so

174
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,460
in this case there is a feeling between

175
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:38,070
you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two is possible to have two</font>

178
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,339
and then under hundreds to may have

185
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:18,310

186
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:20,290
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know from that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from ID</font>

it's also scalable so we will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

193
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:42,449
the past vector protocol means it uses

194
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,220
incremental updates so which means

195
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:48,040
whenever there is a change in routing if

196
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,400
a lot is deleted only the traps removed

197
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,770
or if a new routes are only that the

202
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:12,210
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you exchange the full table if a</font>

205
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:22,290
there is mainly full of exchange unless

206
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,819
you are starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new specification or</font>

292
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,379
four different networks or tomm systems

293
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,679
and within the autonomous system there

294
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:28,059
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a GP and you will have I beach</font>

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,790
between different ultimate systems and

those routers who speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bgp to other</font>

between two differents autonomous

316
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:59,879
systems it as a result the requirement

317
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:02,700
is the two routers speaking ebgp have to

318
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,970
be directly connected obviously there

319
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,700
are exceptions to the rule and you can

320
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,270
have different connectivity mechanisms

321
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,760
to interconnect to border routers

322
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:18,570
portable in over a layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> will appear</font>

324
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:25,889
exception and it's not recommended the

325
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:30,290

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:17,909

meaning of peer another meaning of peer

342
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:39,990
is just ibgp or EBT<font color="#CCCCCC"> possession okay so</font>

343
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:48,419
you may see both thermos in different

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:51,779

that's a fundamental requirement

obviously it's not possible to have

00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:21,230
influencing route selection second one

437
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:23,899
is for loop detection and we'll see that

442
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:37,070
that does not go through a specific

443
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:41,029
autonomous system so you can apply

444
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:46,939
policy to exclude<font color="#E5E5E5"> those prefix or two to</font>

that goes through a specific command

447
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:59,959
system so as a result they are used also

448
00:27:53,539 --> 00:28:01,940
for applying policy so earlier we

449
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,970
discuss that alternative number could be

452
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:16,309
be the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you have a router</font>

other techniques for loops PDP looks

within a single off on a system but this

484

we avoid that later but by default by

00:32:55,299 --> 00:33:03,940
a route from a local prefix into bgp for

526

533
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:33,100
and the reason is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the loop up I</font>

00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:35,019
drivers is used for I beach by pier

535
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,449
that's the recommended that's not a

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the practice</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">common use next half south when you</font>

instead of keeping the image<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeating</font>

next hops off

598
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:26,789

i will appear for a local original route

619
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:42,339

<font color="#CCCCCC">are two other values which is the origin</font>

628
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:19,239
could be a GP or unknown it is it's

629
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,359
basically depending on how you inject

630
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:25,809
the route into bgp if you distribute the

631
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,058
route into bgp it is called unknown the

632
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">origins is is conserved to be unknown</font>

633
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">which means less preferred</font>

634
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:36,799
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> T is injected using a network</font>

statement then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called I origin is</font>

636
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,660
referred to as a GP and it is preferred

637
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:48,229
because if you inject using a network

638
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:51,500
segment you are explicitly injecting a

639
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:53,840
specific prefix and it is typically good

640
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:57,170
for stability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are injecting</font>

641
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,720
the using redistribute you are you're

642
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:02,030
prolly injecting a lot of rods which may

643
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,589
cause flapping and so on so it's usually

644
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:08,480
less preferred obviously again vgp is

645
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:10,750
heavily policy influences so you can

646
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,280
overwrite this the origin of the

647
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:18,620
particular prefix using apology so it's

648
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,840
not fixed you're set in stone you can

649
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,240
always override most of this using a

650
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:28,250
policy including the next hub you can

651

right arm is incomplete obviously GP is

656
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,300
no more there so the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> values are</font>

660
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:05,279
that you can configure router to

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,100
obligate a set of prefixes and inject an

662

use local preference when you received a

689
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:36,030
lot when you filter out from 300 you can

say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a higher local preference</font>

son sorry there are alternatives through

692
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:50,100
s200 so by doing that the traffic that

693

exit points

699
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,240

00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,900
setting a higher local preference going

00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:49,520
it only is it is you don't advertise

00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:25,730
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't set a local preference the</font>

720
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:27,140
local preference becomes hundreds to set

721
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,990
a local preference you have to use a

722
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,670
policy statement to say routes these set

723
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:34,118
of routes will have these local

preference

725
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:46,439
so it is so again it influences exit

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:42,449

00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:03,929
old value is preferred so in this case

you do this the two service providers

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tucson spiders may use in consistent</font>

propagate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to another service provider</font>

practice received into a particular s

and again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laws made is preferred</font>

over a higher made another important

only made values<font color="#CCCCCC"> receive from the same s</font>

791
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:35,089
is compared if I receive routes from two

different cases the meet them then the

793
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:40,760
mates are not compared by default

794
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:45,170
obviously you can override<font color="#CCCCCC"> that using a</font>

795
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,869
policy and say compare made always if

00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:52,090
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that then it will compare the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mayor values from different aces</font>

798
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:03,710
again some confusions here this possible

<font color="#E5E5E5">top the standard wasn't clear on the</font>

should always advertise a mid value or

802
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:15,230
not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of that different vendors</font>

803
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:20,000
implemented it differently so some

804
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:22,670
vendors may decide to to send made value

805
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,849
by default some vendors and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

806
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:28,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide to the default to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero or the</font>

807
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:30,740
default to be higher value and some

808
00:49:28,819 --> 00:49:32,839
vendors may decide if far out is

809
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:36,379
received without a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mate it considers to</font>

810
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:39,230
be a very high made or in some case a

811
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:41,510
very low made so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of that it's</font>

812
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:45,230
very important to understand what the

813
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:48,470
different vendor made values<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

814
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:52,549
defaults are or use configurations to

815
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:54,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">override</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the defaults but it's very</font>

816
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:58,359
important to be aware that vendors have

817
00:49:54,799 --> 00:50:01,940
implemented it implemented differently

818
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:06,348
in that respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the standard</font>

819
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:09,020
wasn't clear on that obviously there are

820
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:12,170
configurations and knobs to influence it

821
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:17,140
one way or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other almost most vendors</font>

822
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:20,049
provide those knobs so one of them is

823
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:23,629
always confirm it another one is

824
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:25,819
considered missing made as worst and so

825
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:28,910
on so there are configurations<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

826
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:34,640
override those default<font color="#E5E5E5"> behaviors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

827
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:38,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">their default behaviour another very</font>

828
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:44,828
important attribute is community so

829
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:47,650
community is used to group different

830
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:50,530
prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be prefixes</font>

831
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:54,250
you would create different communities

832
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:57,730
and then make different BP prefixes to

833
00:50:54,250 --> 00:51:00,220
be member<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different communities then</font>

834
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:02,620
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dealing with individual</font>

835
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:06,430
prefixes you will deal with community

836
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:08,140
attributes so you can say all prefixes

837
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:11,230
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> members of this community I</font>

838
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:13,150
will do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> or prefer this or our not</font>

839
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,010
advertising or our libraries and use the

840
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:20,340
lower preference or with a higher

841
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:25,330
preference and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it makes the</font>

842
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:28,030
dealing with policy much easier than

843
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">just dealing with prefixes and we'll see</font>

844
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:39,370
why that's the case so community is a

845
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">serta bit integer it's usually it's</font>

846
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:47,859
usually formatted as s number and then

847
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,480
specific with the community value and

848
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:56,710
the s number usually the s number of the

849
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:58,720
that service provider so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it</font>

850
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:00,430
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be if the service providers SN is</font>

851
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,910
hundred then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> committees will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

852
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:05,710
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colin something so the end the</font>

853
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:09,899
meaning of the comments is different

854
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:09,900
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the value of the community</font>

855
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,870
so here is an example let's say you

856
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:20,920
don't have any you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't use any</font>

857
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:28,150
communities so in this case what you do

858
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:30,630
is when you receive routes from s100 you

859
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:33,690
say our receive this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you do</font>

860
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:38,290
experiments to receive it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then on</font>

861
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:41,380
eyes on outgoing advertisement from<font color="#E5E5E5"> F to</font>

862
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:44,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">from E to F you explicitly allow that</font>

863
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:49,810
prefix obviously if this is if they are

864
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:52,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">two it's easy let's say but let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say we</font>

865
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:56,038
are some more

866
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:58,559
prefix now received from<font color="#E5E5E5"> s 200 now when</font>

867
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:02,039
i absorb that prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

868
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:06,390
another filter<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and now that prefix to</font>

869
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:08,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as 400 so now the configuration is</font>

870
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:11,670
not just one place you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

871
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:15,569
multiple places<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is just a</font>

872
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:17,519
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> example but the power is it's</font>

873
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">really powerful in terms of how you</font>

874
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,660
influence policy and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

875
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:25,260
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some of the examples real-life</font>

876
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:28,410
examples later now because of this is

877
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:30,470
not scalable as you add more routers you

878
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:34,078
have to take several other routers to

879
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:42,480
just to allow a specific prefix from a

880
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:46,559
specific customer or<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier okay now here</font>

881
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:49,410
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just extending again adding more</font>

882
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,029
prefix we added one more prefix but we

883
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:55,319
don't want to allow that pic is to go

884
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:58,500
out so we didn't allow you to go out on

885
00:53:55,319 --> 00:54:03,420
that pier so using community you can

886
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:07,500
simplify this by saying that when we

887
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:11,730
receive that prefix we say attached

888
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:16,769
community 300 colon one again 300 is s

889
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:20,210
number for that s now on that pier you

890
00:54:16,769 --> 00:54:24,000
just say allow 300 colon one on the

891
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:25,799
outgoing e2f<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just say allow 300</font>

892
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,589
colon<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and that will allow that</font>

893
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:33,779
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> allah community standard colon 1</font>

894
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:37,828
now when we skip another route here you

895
00:54:33,779 --> 00:54:39,930
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make it a member of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

unload on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top one because that</font>

898
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:49,380
community is already allowed or using a

899
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:52,680
policy so when you receive another one

900
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:55,049
which is rendered that one but you don't

901
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,940
want to allow to go out you make the

907

usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case a prefix belongs to</font>

we will see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them that some of</font>

918
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,868

<font color="#CCCCCC">Confederation we cannot discuss about</font>

peers from from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning perspective</font>

922
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:04,180
so we will not do that but we'll touch

923
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:07,960
on the no export export means don't

924
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:14,290
advertise another autonomous system so

925
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:16,859
if for example if a sends around to

926
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:16,859
different routes

00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,430
routes advertise two different routes in

00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:34,400
this particular case<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's advertising an</font>

931
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,709
components of that aggregate there are

932
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:43,099
several of them but it once to advertise

933
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:44,589
them to that sx200 but it doesn't want

to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:56:53,269 --> 00:56:59,718
but the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific prefix advertise</font>

939
00:56:55,910 --> 00:57:01,279
advertise it with no<font color="#E5E5E5"> export so when it's</font>

940
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:04,009
200 receives it it will use it

941
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:05,779
internally within a stew and bread but

942
00:57:04,009 --> 00:57:09,979
it will not advertise<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any other</font>

943
00:57:05,779 --> 00:57:13,940
autonomous system to any other ebgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer</font>

944
00:57:09,979 --> 00:57:18,999
so because it has a no export community

945
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,999
attribute so so that's a predefined

946
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:31,449
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay another one is nokia nokia</font>

947
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:33,890
means appear is as as i alluded first

948
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:38,809
earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pill has two different</font>

949
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:41,629
meanings one is any<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach position but</font>

950
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:43,309
another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP session between two</font>

951
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:46,819
different autonomous systems that

952
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:48,979
exchange their own network but that are

953
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:52,369
not used for transit to another network

954
00:57:48,979 --> 00:57:54,379
and usually it is settlement free which

955
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:55,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">means they don't exchange money they</font>

956
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">just exchanged routes and send traffic</font>

957
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,650
to one another but they don't use one

958
00:57:57,979 --> 00:58:05,149
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> other transit so that type of</font>

959
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:07,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship is called p.m. so no peer</font>

960
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:11,809
means don't advertise this prefix to

961
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:15,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">appear that's the meaning of it so when</font>

962
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:19,099
you do that you can apply a policy on on

963
00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:22,969
a pier session to block those

964
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:26,589
communities or those prefixes with no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

965
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:26,589
peer community attributes

966
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:40,289
now earlier we say that comments are

967
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:43,239
usually number<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a colon notation as</font>

968
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:46,839
number followed by a specific community

969
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:50,169
value now but this assumes again

970
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:53,049
communities are typically are such to

971
00:58:50,169 --> 00:58:56,199
beat so if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cells</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to beat community</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different solutions one of them is just</font>

979
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:18,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">use a private sa number instead of a</font>

hub program the first one it's not it

985
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,969
may conflict with other service provider

986
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:43,509
asains because they may use the same

987
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:44,859
private case a number second one is it

988
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:48,759
may complete with other service

989
00:59:44,859 --> 00:59:50,919

991
00:59:50,919 --> 00:59:58,689

992
00:59:54,999 --> 01:00:00,879
part is specified as a same is to make

unique unique between service providers

994
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:08,049
or between autonomous systems so the

995
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:10,959
third option<font color="#E5E5E5"> is instead of using the</font>

01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:12,869
always advertise communities to the IBT

1010
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:15,630
peers some of them do not advertise

1011
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:19,049
unless you explicitly say advertise

1012
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:21,989
communities on Sulu configuration to IV

1013
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:24,119
GBP the same thing with ebgp some of

1014
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:27,390
them by default advertise communities

1015
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:29,519
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a beach babes some of them do not</font>

1016
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:33,200
by default so you have to excuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1017
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,519
configure it in the case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco on</font>

1018
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,220
ibgp it's the default behavior to

1019
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,779
advertise communities but<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a beach be</font>

1020
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:42,299
peers you have to explicitly say

1021
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:47,849
advertise communities otherwise the

1022
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:51,589
comments will not be advertised it so

1023
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:54,390
it's very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand those</font>

1028
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:09,029
vendors to interpret it so there are

1029
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:12,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">different interpretations or different</font>

1030

1034
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:32,759
the path the path selection process so

1035
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,099
the first is if the route doesn't have

1036
01:02:32,759 --> 01:02:37,730
mix half or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next hub draft is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1037
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:42,050

1038
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:43,700
if you receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> a BGP route and you check</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next half and you don't have you</font>

1040

don't have the next hub in your rocking

1041
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:51,770
table then you don't install it you

1042
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:53,689
don't advertise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also if the maid</font>

1044
01:02:53,690 --> 01:03:03,410
2-1 then it's considered not usable so

1045
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:07,340
you don't use it then comes the

1046
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:11,240
preference in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case of Cisco there is</font>

1047
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:14,420
a local router<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific attributes so</font>

1048
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:16,759
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a BGP attribute is</font>

1049
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:19,369
that's advertised to another peer is

1050
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,530
just local to that router there is a

1051
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:24,680
weight that has a higher preference than

1052
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:31,550
any other preference so the weight so if

1053
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:33,799
awaits configured for for for specific

1054
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:36,410
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that weight will have higher</font>

1055
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:38,600
preference than any other preferences so

1056
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:41,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one is local preference so</font>

1057
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:43,420
local preference is very influential so

1058
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:46,549
if you remember local preference

1059
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:50,420
determines how traffic exists an

1060
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:53,900
autonomous system so that again the

1061
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:56,240
higher local preference is preferred the

1062
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:59,000
next one is preferred locally or unit

1063
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:01,729
routes / routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> received from other</font>

1064
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,740
peers so if you are in a drought if an

1065
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:06,410
author originates are out then that's

1066
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:10,399
preferred over route received from other

1067
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:13,279
peers or other sessions the next one is

1068
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the length of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> A's paths if the a</font>

1069
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:19,730
spaz language is shorter than that's

1070
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:22,609
preferred over a longer a spot obviously

1071
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:25,760
you can ignore it so in most of these

1072
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:28,279
cases there are of policies to configure

1073
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:32,690
to influence the decision so you can say

1074
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:36,340
ignore a spaz comparison i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1075
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:36,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">use something else to compare us</font>

1076
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,040
next one is origin we discussed origin

1077
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:46,170
earlier I<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS preferred over in</font>

1078
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:50,759
completes then EGP is not there in

1079
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture anymore make is norm it is</font>

1080
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,849

1081
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:58,650
there are some knobs maids only<font color="#CCCCCC"> compare</font>

1082
01:04:56,849 --> 01:05:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">with four routes Lisa from the same</font>

1083
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:02,910

1084
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,580
it for us elicit from different ultimate

1085
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:07,200
systems then you have to use we have to

1086
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:12,930
override it using bgp always compare

1087
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:15,810
made then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next one is preferred abb</font>

1088
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:18,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">passed over I PHP paths so if if outer</font>

1089
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:21,480
receives the same route one from I beach

1090
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:23,599
ppl another one from a PT PP r then that

1091
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:28,880
out from the ebgp peel is preferred over

1092
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:31,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from I will appear obviously</font>

1093
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,930
considering all the others are the same

1094
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:38,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">or all the previous comparisons are the</font>

1095
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:42,049
same the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one is the path with the</font>

1096
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">lost a geometric to the next hub of the</font>

1097
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:47,339
BGP route is preferred and the next one

1098
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,250
is if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lost</font>

1099
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:54,630
router ID is preferred of the originator

1100
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:57,900
and then if there are multiple router

1101
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:59,790
reflectors in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list then the cluster</font>

1102
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,820
list the shortest shortest cluster list

1103
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:08,880
is preferred and then lost IP address

1104
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:11,250
number for the neighbor is preferred so

1105
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,070
in a multi-vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment make sure</font>

1106
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:16,230
the past public process is understood

1107
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:19,170
each branch so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some variations</font>

1108
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:21,810
between brands and then defaults also as

1109
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:24,359
we discussed earlier so some may for

1110
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:26,369
example are what has made some may not

1111
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:31,980
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have to understand that</font>

1112
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:37,260
and avoids a maid confusion applying

1113
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:41,339
policy with bgp so any questions on the

1114
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:45,000
beach<font color="#E5E5E5"> p attributes and pass election ok</font>

1115
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:49,999
so now let's see how a policy is used

1116
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,439
influence how track is proud or

1117
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:53,598
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quality typical traffic</font>

1118
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:56,058
engineering you can steer your traffic

1119
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:59,439
to go through this way or that way or to

1120
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:59,439
come through this way or the other way

1121
01:07:00,999 --> 01:07:09,468
so almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody just does the default</font>

1122
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:13,669
configuration and get done that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

1123
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:15,799
are not decades particularly on ebgp

1124
01:07:13,669 --> 01:07:18,679

1135
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:53,509

1142

network are different so you have to

1143
01:08:08,929 --> 01:08:12,829
apply different policies to influence

the problems will be one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problems</font>

1253
01:14:10,919 --> 01:14:17,249
is let's say you apply a policy to your

image will appear now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the routes because of that bgp</font>

1256
01:14:18,869 --> 01:14:24,239
policy and later on you change the

1257
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:27,030
policy but since you already drop and

1258
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:29,610
since v GP is incremental you'll not be

1259

<font color="#CCCCCC">able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> receive those routes that you</font>

01:14:40,919 --> 01:14:46,099
is very bad alternative because it's not

it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for the Internet's</font>

route from your PA

you will always keep those routes even

1273
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:09,060
if they are dropped so which means you

1274
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:11,280
have to you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another set of</font>

1277
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:21,240
lot of memory particularly if you are

1278
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:23,250
peeling to so many peers and receiving

1279
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:26,340
routes several hours from each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1280
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:28,800
them so it doesn't scale well so what

01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:30,480
the router first<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity does is by</font>

implementing the Refresh capability and

1285
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:39,150
happens is when you change a policy the

system will automatically send a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

advertise to ebgp peers if it receives

01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:57,190
but you're not advertised to learn other

1352
01:18:53,590 --> 01:19:00,010

<font color="#CCCCCC">flickr is different from normal ibgp</font>

1354
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:06,340
rather you can have multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes</font>

1355
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:09,959
reflectors obviously you need to have

1356
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:12,940
multiple reflectors for redundancy

1357
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:18,040
you can also split the network into

1358
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:19,629
multiple domains and each one of them

1359
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:21,550
will have their own reflectors and then

1360
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:28,929
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route reflectors can peer with one</font>

uses originator ID for<font color="#CCCCCC"> luke probation so</font>

1363
01:19:33,219 --> 01:19:39,429
if a route reflector sees its own ID

01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:41,739
within the with another BTW i will

1365

update<font color="#CCCCCC"> its knows that it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> originated</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">how the new providence works again</font>

1368
01:19:48,969 --> 01:19:55,020
redundancy is important usually we will

1369
01:19:51,429 --> 01:19:58,949
divide your network into clusters each

1370
01:19:55,020 --> 01:20:01,570
route reflector will be its own cluster

1371
01:19:58,949 --> 01:20:05,349
typically and you use a router ID as a

1372
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:07,150
cluster ID so<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally clans will</font>

1373
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:09,280
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> with two different route</font>

1374
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:11,290
reflectors for redundancy purpose and

1375
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:15,099
those craft or art collectors will be in

1376
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:17,909
two different clusters so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

1377
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:20,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">example this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case the result shows two</font>

1378
01:20:17,909 --> 01:20:22,420
clusters since that two different

1379
01:20:20,739 --> 01:20:25,870
different domains you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

1380
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:28,870
as six clusters in this case but you can

1381
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:30,280
also make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just two clusters but in</font>

1382
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:33,340
this particular case since you we

1383
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:35,860
normally use the router ID as a cluster

1384
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:39,100
ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in this case this particular</font>

1385
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:44,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have six clusters because you</font>

1386
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:48,730
have six lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lectures but the</font>

1387
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:52,659
important is each plant<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierce have IP</font>

1388
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:58,419
physician<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 out of letters in two</font>

1389
01:20:52,659 --> 01:21:00,989
different clusters so the benefit is it

1390
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:05,170
solves I which we make a scaling issue

1391
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:08,280
it doesn't impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet forwarding it</font>

1392
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:12,400
does impact it a little bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

1393
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:15,880
our ultimate so a route reflector one of

1394
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:19,360
the dispute criteria for bgp pass is if

1395
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:21,290
everything is<font color="#E5E5E5"> equal then the IDP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matrix</font>

1396
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,839
for the next half is used

1397
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:25,880
so the IDP matric view /<font color="#E5E5E5"> alto flexor may</font>

1398
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:29,480
be different from an IP geometric view

1399
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:33,110
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plant so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of that there is</font>

1400
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:36,440
some variation but it's not significant

1401
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:43,099
so it's worth having that reflector to

1402
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:48,860
to avoid the scaling issue and it's easy

1403
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:51,980
for migration so typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always</font>

1404
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:58,130
because of that because there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1405
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:59,929
flector view of the IDP metric you want

1406
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:02,360
it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned with the view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1407
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:05,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">clans it's important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

1408
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:08,570

1409
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:11,540
past to all the other routers it's not

1410
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:15,320
always possible but it's better to try

1411
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:20,680
to have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a topological Center to</font>

1412
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:20,679
avoid that<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp metric view discrepancy</font>

1413
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:33,629
so the typical migrations dealing with

1414
01:22:29,639 --> 01:22:38,159
migration typical migration is core

1415
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:40,139
routers have fully mixed bgp so the

1416
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:42,900
co-authors will have full mesh HP or the

1417
01:22:40,139 --> 01:22:44,579
core if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the co-authors as a</font>

reflector zone don't be they'll have

1419
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:50,670
full I beach finish and then the edges

1420
01:22:47,099 --> 01:22:54,420
will have I by bgp clamped peeling to

1421
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:57,480
the core routers that's one example so

1422
01:22:54,420 --> 01:23:00,469
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's say here the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quarters have</font>

1423

1424

01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:40,200
which becomes gay Jewish Confederation

1436
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:43,170
deals with the item image issue but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1437
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:45,900
deals<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a different way what does is</font>

1438
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:48,750
it subdivides the network into smaller

1439
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:51,450
networks and each one of them are

1440
01:23:48,750 --> 01:24:00,120
considered as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sub Confederation or a</font>

1441
01:23:51,450 --> 01:24:03,960
sub s of the big s so so it divides the

1442
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:06,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">8th in to start SS each sub s we have I</font>

1443
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:10,350
which repealing within the sub s and

1444
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:13,050
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a bitch repealing between</font>

1445
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:15,480
sub<font color="#CCCCCC"> aces but that image</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> repeating</font>

1446
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:21,360
between sub SS is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not visible externally</font>

1447
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:24,330
it's only internal to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network again</font>

1448
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:26,429
in the same way as route reflectors the

1449
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:33,780
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sub comprehensive</font>

1450
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:35,280
configuration has one<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp network so</font>

1451
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:38,009
this product<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has to go through the</font>

1452
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:41,400
example here is an example so in this

1453
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:47,130
case s 200 is split into three sub

1454
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:51,299
Confederations or set<font color="#E5E5E5"> aces 65 5 30 6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 55</font>

1455
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:54,170
32 and 65 531 so so typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1456
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:56,970
private SN number is used as the

1457
01:24:54,170 --> 01:25:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Confederation s number or sub computer s</font>

1458
01:24:56,970 --> 01:25:01,070
number so in this particular case

1459
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:10,410
computation 655 32 is configured to<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

1460
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:15,860
with other sub Confederations 6 55 60

1461
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:19,260
and 65 531 and it's configured with the

1462
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:21,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ace number of the whole network</font>

1463
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:24,150
which is the PHP configuration

1464
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:26,250
identifier is a same number of the

1465
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:28,679
network so when when there is a bitch

1466
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:31,860
repealing between C and external network

1467
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:34,280
it will use 200 as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn number for</font>

1468
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,280
that network

1469
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:46,400
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the key in the sub competitor</font>

1470
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:47,810
the Confederation is the next hop<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

1471
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:51,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">changing when it's advertised it from</font>

1472
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:53,270
one sub s to another sub s and unlike

1473
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:55,310
other ebgp peeling the normal eep eep

1474
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:57,830
appealing when you send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one is</font>

1475
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:59,930
to another the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next tab is changing</font>

1476
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:04,280
in sub homepage the next hop is not

1477
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:07,250
changed the local preference as well as

1478
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:10,670
made are not changed either but there

1479
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:16,130
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sub the configuration s past</font>

1480
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:18,350
sub the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Espada's you can see here 6500 2</font>

1481
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:20,870
and so on but when it is advertised to

1482
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:23,420
external routers that will be removed

1483
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:32,450
that's only for internal within the

1484
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:35,150
Confederation so our proposition is

1485
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:41,179
pretty much the same except<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1486
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:45,219
remove the the local preference made and

1487
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:45,220
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop as kept as they are</font>

1488
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:58,509
so in summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compare the two both of</font>

1489
01:26:55,420 --> 01:27:01,420
them deal with the scaling issue the

1490
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:05,170
full measure scaling issue and they are

1491
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:07,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">higher up there is polish Polish control</font>

1492
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:10,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">for both of them but in terms of</font>

1493
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:14,769
scalability but after<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexure scales</font>

1494
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:21,280
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high compared to Confederation it's</font>

1495
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:22,810
easier to migrate so in most cases prior

1496
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,280
to flexors are preferred and most of the

1497
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:27,900
implementations use the router

1498
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,900
collectors and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Confederations</font>

1499
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:33,850
but Confederations allow absorbing other

1500
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,630
service providers into the network so

1501
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:40,199
because of mergers and acquisitions some

1502
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:42,100
service providers went to through the

1503
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:43,719
Confederation path instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rosen</font>

1504
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">flickr and you can still use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the route</font>

1505
01:27:43,719 --> 01:27:53,400
reflectors within a confederation any

1506
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:53,400
questions

1507
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:05,010
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll stop this topic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then pull</font>

1508
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:11,070
brakes on the next section is not as

1509
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:13,110
broad as is not long so I will include

1510
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:17,190
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision to the next</font>

1511
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:20,269
session so which become is another

1512
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:23,370
scaling techniques and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that</font>

1513
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:28,680
so I'll jump straight into some of the

1514
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:30,930
examples so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one example so there</font>

1515
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:33,150
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two examples customer age and</font>

1516
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:36,060
Internet age let's go through that

1517
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:39,629
customer age example in this particular

1518
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:42,690
case let's say a service provider has

1519
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:46,560
three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of connections to</font>

1520
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:54,179
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Pierce which means exchange</font>

1521
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:56,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">free exchange free settlement free peer</font>

1522
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:59,610
or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> beach possession each possession</font>

1523
01:28:56,490 --> 01:29:01,950
another one is private peeling again

1524
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:04,950
that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> settlement free another one</font>

1525
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:07,769
is trying this provider so they have

1526
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have trans provider so for their</font>

1527
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:13,740
customers they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can provide access either</font>

1528
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:17,460
to the whole internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just to some of</font>

1529
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:19,950
the their own peers obviously when they

1530
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide access to the whole internet</font>

1531
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:25,260
since they are paying the trans provider

1532
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:27,810
they'll be incurring costs but if they

1533
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,510
are sending it only to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierce then</font>

1534
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:32,790
the cost is minimal compared to sending

1535
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:35,400
it to the transcript to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transit</font>

1536
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:37,500
provider so they may charge their

1537
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:39,599
customers accordingly and then classify

1538
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:43,230
their customers accordingly based on

1539
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that relationship so in this case for</font>

1540
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:52,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">example so for XP connections that's for</font>

1541
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:58,080
peeling connections it uses community

1542
01:29:52,730 --> 01:30:02,750
120 100 for private peer uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2200</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1543
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:07,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">for internet peeling it doesn't use any</font>

1544
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:10,710
community so it gives the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

1545
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:14,369
so customers who buy just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a XP they will</font>

1546
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:17,820
get 2100 so they will only get routes

1547
01:30:14,369 --> 01:30:22,549
from 2100 will come with<font color="#CCCCCC"> commutativity</font>

1548
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:25,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2100 and customers who buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1549
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:28,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">thumbscrew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by private peeling as well</font>

1550
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:30,269
they will receive the 2200 community but

1551
01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:32,308
customers who buy the whole internet

1552
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:37,829
they will not get committee which means

1553
01:30:32,309 --> 01:30:39,630
the zone sent to the whole internet so

1554
01:30:37,829 --> 01:30:43,409
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how these three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different types</font>

1555
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:45,059
of customers are implemented so using

1556
01:30:43,409 --> 01:30:46,530
community simplifies that configuration

1557
01:30:45,059 --> 01:30:49,770
otherwise you have to classify each

1558
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:53,789
prefix of the customer and doing that

1559
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:57,059
will be will not be scalable another

1560
01:30:53,789 --> 01:31:01,170
example is the customer age so is the

1561
01:30:57,059 --> 01:31:03,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet age so in the Internet age so</font>

1562
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:05,219
this the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the peeling</font>

1563
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:06,960
applied on the castellan the customer

1564
01:31:05,219 --> 01:31:09,539
cage in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community is</font>

1565
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,250
applied on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet age so in this</font>

1566
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:17,639
case the customers are classified into

1567
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:20,489
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> classified into customer so the</font>

1568
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:23,489
peelings are classified into customer XP

1569
01:31:20,489 --> 01:31:30,539
private peel and transit provider and by

1570
01:31:23,489 --> 01:31:34,500
doing that they they basically filter

1571
01:31:30,539 --> 01:31:38,159
prefixes going to the pier based on

1572
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:42,510
these attributes<font color="#E5E5E5"> community attributes so</font>

1573
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:43,739
here's an example so customer prefix so

1574
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:46,770
if customer wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send other</font>

1575
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:52,098
customers they will receive 3000.com is

1576
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:55,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">3,000 if they want to send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to receive</font>

1577
01:31:52,099 --> 01:32:00,119
