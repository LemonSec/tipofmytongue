2
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,109
Michael suggested you guys were anxious

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,060
to get to this talk I actually expect

4
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,500
you're anxious<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to the break that</font>

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,219
immediately follows this talk so I'm

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,239
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be equally quick even more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

7
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,250
so a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of important things you</font>

8
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,809
folks need to know I'm John I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,710
people know me I'm the president and CEO

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Varun Aaron we have an IP address free</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> half of the Caribbean that pool is</font>

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,510
not out but it's getting there as of

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,739
this morning 2.28 / 8 equivalents in

15

requests come in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to drop</font>

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,320
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick requests aren't in picking</font>

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,360
up the scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the bottom there that's</font>

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,580
month by month you can see in the last

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,330
three months as a distinct uptick in

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,289
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP and end user requests so small</font>

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,780
free pool fixed amount running out

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,220
increasing number of requests coming in

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,140
this is you know this question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,420
month what year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can ask people</font>

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,009
like Jeff Houston Tony hain to do that

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,680
work for you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell you</font>

28
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,290
what's happening very soon it<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be</font>

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,079
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some some very significant</font>

30
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,119
requests for service providers who are

31
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,210
serving customers all over the world but

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,710
their equipment is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our region if you</font>

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,329
take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some of those requests</font>

34
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,509
you could see us running out at the end

35
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">of summer more realistically right now</font>

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,820
probably in the first quarter next year

37
00:01:51,689 --> 00:02:02,119
so I'm going to happen just question<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

38
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:07,679
in terms of ISPs v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus v6 we have</font>

39
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:10,199
4340 373 isp subscribers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron a lot</font>

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,230
of you have v4 and v6 allocations some

41
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,859
have v6 only and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because your v4</font>

42
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,079
allocation

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,400
was a sub allocation from some other isp

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,430
so we don't see it directly in our

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">database but there's a lot of folks who</font>

46
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,010
have ipv4 only and for the life of us we

47
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,010
can't discern you having a v6 allocation

48
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,350
so if you're one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those ISPs who only</font>

49
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,970
have v4 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have not yet gone and got v6</font>

50
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,040
you might want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

51
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,230
running out of v6 thank God we're not

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,390
going to run out but it would reassure

53
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,109
us that that everyone's working on

54
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,149
getting v6 deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for folks in</font>

55
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,650
other regions for example folks in the

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,900

in the AP<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick policy are compatible</font>

59
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,200
this has lots of folks in the

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,030
asia-pacific<font color="#E5E5E5"> region who need addresses</font>

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,220
who are doing transfers from

organizations in this region that have

63
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,510
the addresses and don't have don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

64
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,220
them all<font color="#E5E5E5"> only need half whatever these</font>

65
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,429
are successful in growing and there's

66
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,370
the list this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> online a couple of</font>

67
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,250
little things rpki we have hosted our

68
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">pki deployed and we got that for some</font>

69
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,750
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> since last year we have</font>

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,850
organizations using it issuing row is

71
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,489
relying parties when I say we have

72
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,739
people using it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just comparison we have</font>

73
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,810
people using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas right has lots</font>

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,720
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it this is a discrepancy</font>

75
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,970
again that puzzles me and so people

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">should think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we also have</font>

you use the web we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet have the</font>

80
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,769
automation so that as you do things

81
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,150
they're automatically sub delegations

82
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,340
are handled that's called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> up/down</font>

83
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,459
protocol and that's in the near coming

84
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,530
work on this slide we've also integrated

of the number space this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very good</font>

major amount of work for us but<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

96
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,579
overdue<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a lot of what we do though</font>

97
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,048
is policy consultations people come in

98
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,780
they request addresses or they request

99
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,950
transfers we say here's the policy and

100
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,260
they go where did that come from

101
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer to the</font>

102
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,820
question of where did the policy that

103
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,979
we're applying come from we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

104
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,810
do a lot more with Nana<font color="#E5E5E5"> Guinness and so</font>

105
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">while we've always had a joint</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

106
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,150
every year we're also doing public

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,160
policy consultations at nanog there is a

108
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,530
public policy consultation taking place

109
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,350
at this day ugh there's a public policy

110
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,469
consultation taking place at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana</font>

111
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,840
today in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you're</font>

112
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in policies we have a couple</font>

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them are going to be discussing today</font>

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,400
here for 45 is where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be and</font>

115
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,229
this helps refine the policy proposals

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,880
that are underway of course we also have

117
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,470
one coming up at our joint meeting in

118
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,730
Phoenix which will be going to in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

119
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,260
fall today we have full policy proposals

120
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,320
that are under discussion these are

121
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,570
Brock policies one is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inter rer</font>

122
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,940
transfer of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs know if it's a priority</font>

123
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,520
or not but it's been suggested there's a

124
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,250
policy to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier for 3gpp</font>

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,620
networks to get more ipv4 space there's

126
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,770
a policy to add the principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

127
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,710
in RFC 2053 2050s one of those

128
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,270
foundational documents from 1997 to

129
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,940
bring some of those principles into our

130
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:43,200
number resource manual the policy manual

131
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,570
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin RC 2050 is got some things we</font>

132
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,479
know are<font color="#CCCCCC"> today tenant and so it's being</font>

133
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,240
revised at the IETF there's an RFC 2050

134
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,640
biz and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is preparation for when</font>

135
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,350
that happens to take the things that we

136
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,270
think need to be preserved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are in</font>

137
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new document and bring them into the</font>

138
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,729
policy manual and then there's updates

139
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,820
to the lir ISP and end-user definitions

140
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:08,220
we we use the term isp right pieces the
