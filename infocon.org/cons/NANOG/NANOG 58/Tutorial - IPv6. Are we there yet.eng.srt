the end to actually give you guys a

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,120

things that are causing some issues and

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,610
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> impeding roll out there are also</font>

45

if not change there are obviously a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with applications as I said</font>

relating to the way things work with

ICMP in the broadcast domain and v6 that

enshrined in a security checklist

whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not it is correct or useful</font>

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,329
is no longer relevant it is now in the

security check list and will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

84
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,840

87
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,719
bit about IPSec as well and then i'll be

88
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,250
talking about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and what fun they</font>

89
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">are having and what that means for the</font>

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,860
those

91
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:11,270
we're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> building networks so the</font>

goal of the IETF and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beast be stated</font>

93
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:17,900
fact as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as they were concerned was</font>

94
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:21,890
that by 2012 we would be fully moved

95
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:24,440
from before<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be 6 and this was the</font>

96
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:28,310
cute little graph that projected what

97
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,190
adoption<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going to be like and as you</font>

98
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,030
can see by last year before it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

completely replaced by the sex yeah it's

100
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,780
a nice story this is much more accurate

101
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,170

it's not quite as grim but we're still

104
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,890
in me a couple percent range other than

105
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,979
in certain countries it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing it's</font>

fractions of a percent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and a half</font>

percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it double there are some</font>

144
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,180
shrewd enough including AT&T<font color="#CCCCCC"> Verizon to</font>

say more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use v6 we're</font>

146
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,420
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually use carrier-grade NAT</font>

147
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,849
or nat64 as a transition for the before

148
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,960
part of it but what we're going to do is

149
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,940
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to all the content</font>

150
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,280
providers that our users use more

151
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,870
frequently and convince them to be v6

152
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,299
reachable because that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

153
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,710
not overloading our CG ends and that was

154
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,020
their bet that they could get enough

155
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:09,049
traffic shifted that enough of their

156
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,870
users would be using v6 native that they

157
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,060
would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have their cg</font>

158
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,400
ends take the load and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bet is mostly</font>

159
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,520
worked and this thirty percent number<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

160
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a little bit behind a TV for</font>

162
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,520
percent but we're talking significant

163
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,300
fractions of their traffic actually is

164
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,120
using native v6 and things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> france</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with free at night for things like movie</font>

think hulu is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also available v6 you're</font>

168
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,270
actually seeing forty percent of their

169
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,620
nighttime traffic which you know every

170
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,049
different type of network has a

171
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,400
different traffic pattern but these days

172
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and awful lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are getting</font>

175
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,970
actually cable for Internet and then

176
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,090
they get all of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> other stuff over</font>

177
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:59,340
that internet connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> Switzerland</font>

swisscom just recently did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge push</font>

179
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,539
and they have now actually taken over as

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,849
number one in usage in the last few

181
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks and that's another one of those I</font>

182
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:09,270
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve percent usage and</font>

183
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,219
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encouraging all it takes</font>

184
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,940
is one significant provider in the

185
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,560
country to shift and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see major</font>

186
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,509
proportions of traffic because there is

187
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,250
enough useful content another one is you

188
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:23,130
when you look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1000 top</font>

189
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:26,280

them are actually usable v6 not just

191
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,840
advertising want a to get you to the

<font color="#E5E5E5">landing part but if you're on a v6 only</font>

193
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,770
network you get almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> no content no</font>

194
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,630
images there's an actual reasonable

195
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,679
measurable chunk of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks who are</font>

giving usable v6 experience a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

197
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,069
that has to do with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CDMS Akamai and limelight are both now</font>

204
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,329
CDN are doing that waiting for Amazon is

205
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,440
the major missing piece if they do that

206
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:06,890
there's likely going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these sort of major Sun leaps forward</font>

208
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,850
the other thing that's happening is that

209
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,070
in Europe because they're pushing v6 in

210

several of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these countries that are way</font>

211
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,290
ahead or pushing traffic is we're

212
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,060
actually getting into double digits as

213
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,910
percentage of all IX traffic at some of

214
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,000
the big exchanges in Europe are now be

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">six it's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer just the people like</font>

hurricane electric<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the leading edge</font>

217
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,690
who are saying is some significant chunk

218
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:36,300
of their traffic is v6 so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

219
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,029
encouraging news there are however as

220
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,930
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening lots of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that we</font>

222
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,209

<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know moving to v6 is really hard you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know there are so many issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of</font>

225
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,040
the biggest ones that is impeding many

226
00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:01,840
people is the fact that in before with

227
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,849
dhcp client you ideas used but the MAC

228
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,670
addresses still really the primary means

229
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,830
by which the lease is identified with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:15,070
essentially database and it is usually

232
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:17,680
how most forms are reserved or fixed

233
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:21,040
address schemes or set-top box schemes

234
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,800
work there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some people that are</font>

235
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,870
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> circuit ID and remote ID in before</font>

236
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,150
and if you're using that congratulations

237
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,920
because that does work would be six but

238
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,990
mac addresses are still how much of the

<font color="#CCCCCC">IT I felt that MAC addresses were</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to completely wipe them from v6 and they</font>

had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate points you know we</font>

MAC addresses are not guaranteed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

249
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,710
unique even though they're supposed to

250
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:03,130
be and of course virtual MAC addresses

251
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:05,920
on virtual machines there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken</font>

up spinning up 10 virtual machines with

257
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,230
is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a multi interface</font>

258
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,849
machine which these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our</font>

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,660
of our smartphones and even some of our

261
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,939
tablets are actually multiple network

262
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,689
interface and if you use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac address</font>

263
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,070
the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP connection before gets</font>

264
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,450
the address and after that everyone is

265
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:39,700
told you already have an address what

266
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,640
the ITF ignored was the fact that while

267
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,170
yes all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are technically</font>

268
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,470
correct there they are broken they are

269
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,099
undesirable the vast majority of the

270
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,560
internet got on using that

271
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,150
passes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is mostly still</font>

272
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,319
functioning by some definition of

273
00:11:53,150 --> 00:12:00,500
functioning and it's how everybody does

274
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,600
it and as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say it's</font>

276
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,130
sing your network is broken and you are

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,100

up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DUI GA the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP unique</font>

that it really does well one of them is

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> per host identity</font>

286
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,480
whether your server your client you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

287
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,979
a unique duid that is one per host the

288
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,720
way that you identify network interfaces

289
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,000
is you have an identity<font color="#CCCCCC"> association</font>

290
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,940
which is a collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of addresses that</font>

291
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,730
belong to that particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> nick and the</font>

292
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,830
pairing of DUI dnia guarantees that

293
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,350
every network interface can be uniquely

294
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,020
identified therefore you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP for</font>

295
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,060
all of them and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely an</font>

296
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:58,610
improvement so we've now fixed one of

297
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:59,989
the three fundamental flaws but there's

298
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,460
some problems one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them obviously is</font>

299
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,960
anybody who's doing filtering with mac

300
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,700
addresses it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks or the</font>

301
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,310
compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see quite frequently is</font>

302
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,660
since before still around you do all of

303
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,560
these indication all the walled garden

304
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,630
ate everything else with before and it's

305
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,119
a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and then you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

306
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,360
porter do whatever you're doing and some

307
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff then let you use v6 even</font>

308
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,340
though you've not actually correlated

309
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:30,260
them most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us would like to know that</font>

310
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,390
a particular user's machine has this

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,000
collection of before<font color="#CCCCCC"> NV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 addresses at</font>

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,650
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that also is currently</font>

313
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,410
impossible with the lease if you don't

314
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:43,040
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information and the last one</font>

315
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,750
is sort of interesting the way the duid

316
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,780
works is the first time that you as a

317
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,420
server come up to serve dhcp leases or

318
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,860
as a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask for it you check and</font>

319
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,519
persistent storage to see if you

320
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,930
have a DUI<font color="#CCCCCC"> t if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> create it</font>

321
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,519
once you've created that once you write

322
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,319
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into persistent storage which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

325
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,930
and it's in usually the leases file on

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:12,010
Max and Linn experience and then forever

327
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:15,319
thereafter you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look in that file for it</font>

328
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:18,470
which is fine until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do something</font>

329
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,899
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ghost an image for 10 laptops</font>

wipe the registry of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the leases file or</font>

332
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,140
you create a virtual machine template

333
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:31,490
and forget that you put a DUI d in and

334
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,290
now when you spin up those 10 virtual

the its unique problem and by definition

338
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,230
since we're ready in persistent storage

339
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,899
it has to be changed by software not

340

only can be but must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so they have</font>

effectively broken all of our

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,750
there's a draft which at this point I

346
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:04,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it did make the rfcs it was in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">address into a real a packet from a DHCP</font>

350

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:25,100
for everything else and it was already

354
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">there before so at least a lot of the</font>

process it the issue of course is that

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,979
this means that all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks that</font>

their code to support this and the

<font color="#E5E5E5">several major flavors of dhcp most of</font>

which are is C or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows based servers</font>

363
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,990
will have to be modified<font color="#CCCCCC"> to alter this</font>

364
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,360
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that and we figure out</font>

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">where's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leases is going then we'll</font>

correlations of it because

368
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,350
no longer the key the best we can hope

369
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,290
for is that at least it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

that's already supported on dhcpv6

of this gear like phones and printers

<font color="#E5E5E5">has all the spender option because you</font>

wouldn't give us another way of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

391
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:53,660
other than dhcp and g we want to fall

392
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,930
route and so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a whole series of</font>

393
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,430
religious wars and so in before

394
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously you could statically route</font>

395

things that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your choices or</font>

you simply said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp that was</font>

398
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,170
choices that meant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as you</font>

399
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:12,139
came up you just started you did your

400
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">dhcp discover and you went through the</font>

401
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,590
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> torah process and got releases and</font>

402
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:19,760
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> she got was a default</font>

403
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:22,879
route now the ITF more or<font color="#CCCCCC"> less correctly</font>

404
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,710
did point out that it if the router

405
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,180
people who changed the routing

406
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,550
infrastructure and change what are the

407
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,740
useful default gateways are not the

408
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,720
people who maintain the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP servers and</font>

409
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,820
or don't talk to them or<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow that</font>

410
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">process is missed you will appliance</font>

411
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,080
will be handed a default route via<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP</font>

412
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,149
that won't accurately reflect how the

413
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,949
network's built at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment and that</font>

414
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,690
therefore that's their argument freezing

415
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,090
Ras is that obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys to do the</font>

416
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">routers no one whose default route</font>

417
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,350
change and therefore that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the correct</font>

418
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,020
place to tell all the clients where the

419
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:57,980
default routes are and there is some

420
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,908
validity to that these six is a little

421
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">more complicated</font>

422
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:02,809
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a poll of these little bits the RFC's</font>

423
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:06,139
you can still statically route a few so

424
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:08,809
choose it's not my recommendation for

425
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:10,549
most things there are certain instances

426
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,869
like server farms where it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

427
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:16,549
appropriate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it certainly it's an</font>

large<font color="#CCCCCC"> amounts of servers or hosts you</font>

430
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:24,529
obviously can't just do<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP because you</font>

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,479
can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fall route in as a</font>

432
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:30,379
matter of fact because of the way it's

433
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:32,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">written technically the intent is it's</font>

434
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:34,609
somewhat ambiguous in the wording you

435
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:36,349
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue it's not the case but the</font>

436
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:39,408
intent specifically stated by the idea

437
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:42,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should not DHCP until you</font>

438
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:45,529
have received an RA message that has

certain bits o and M that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tell</font>

440
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:50,029
you you should DHCP so if you have a

client that comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just starts</font>

444
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:59,479
received an RA technically you're

445
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,668
violating the rfcs or at least the

446
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:05,509
intent there are some arguments in the

447
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:08,090
wireless and low-power about that in

448
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:09,739
theory we're going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get an RA</font>

449
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,509
message first<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what happens is you</font>

450
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:12,769
come up you configure link local which

451
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:14,149
gives you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> usable layer 3</font>

461
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:39,080

00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:44,149
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cooperate with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP</font>

changed in the network in this case the

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,389
rather guys can actually break things

483
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,330
because they can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit so that</font>

another bit of fun it's called happy

488
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,768
eyeballs the story goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

489
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:57,529
originally of course ipv6 was was

490
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,720
shinier newer and more special than

491
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:02,990
before and should always be used if it

492
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,830
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> available and so all of the network</font>

493
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,690
stack said I will if I have a v6 stack

494
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,428
enable always doing why they<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up</font>

495
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,860
whenever I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> hitting a DNS label</font>

496
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:15,139
training to an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

497
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,620
quite a record back I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempt to</font>

498
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:21,229
connect that only<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I fail to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect</font>

499
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,969
after some period of time which as we

500
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,750
discovered in some testing with folks

501
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,159
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo could be up to two minutes</font>

502
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,139
only then would it actually do an a

503
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,600
record lookup and then get to the before

504
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:36,590
and the problem at the time was there

505
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:39,529
were two sets of problems there were

506
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,539
people who didn't have useful v6

507
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:43,639
connectivity but their local network

508
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:45,908
advertised that they should configure v6

509
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:49,340
which is now on by default in Windows

510
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:51,590
and so they would think that they had v6

511
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,309
accepted they had no useful route to the

512
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,110
actual existing v6 internet and there

513
00:21:55,309 --> 00:22:00,139
were other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mistakenly</font>

514
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:04,479
configured v6 and shouldn't have because

515
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:06,510
the OS and bugs what it meant was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

516
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,299
you put up a quite a record on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

517
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:13,000
website some reasonable chunk of the

518
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,790
user population would actually have a

519
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,410
very suboptimal experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

520
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,470
these days the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general rule of thumb</font>

521
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,570
is that a user within<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 milliseconds</font>

522
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,059
of a page not loading might hit reload

523
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:27,189
once and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't work they will</font>

524
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:31,178
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away you've lost them to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font>

525
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">page so if 200 milliseconds is way too</font>

526
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:37,410
long for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to wait two minutes is</font>

527
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,939
of course outside the realm of reason so

528
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:42,610
they decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do</font>

529
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,980
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else and the ITF response was</font>

530
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,240
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we don't really users don't</font>

531
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,890
really care whether it's before it be

532
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">six they want their content so their</font>

533
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:55,179
eyeballs are happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

534
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:58,178
a draft instance was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPF and it was</font>

535
00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:01,030
a draft in than an RFC it was a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

536
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:03,190
drawn-out process and in the meantime

537
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:06,399
there were users who were having

538
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,380
problems and so for some people in the

539
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,169
ITF were also going but that doubles DNS

540
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,580
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS servers will at which</font>

541
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:14,860
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us about operational</font>

542
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,870
experience said DNS packets are small

543
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,100
DNS servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are big and beefy who cares</font>

544
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,809
if we double our traffic we've been

545
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,980
doubling in any way have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

546
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:25,870
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> pianists lookups your</font>

547
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:28,360
smartphone does when it comes up if you

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,949
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook Google and something else on</font>

549
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,199
an iphone i think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time i tested</font>

550
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:37,120
it was 72 dns lookups when it when it

551
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,880
comes out of sleep in the first 10 to 15

552
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,870
seconds so yeah if you can't handle that

553
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,660
you can tell that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have other</font>

554
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,370
problems unfortunately they were taking

555
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,799
their time as they will and the browser

556
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,139
guy said well we can fix that we've

557
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:51,460
already put stuff resolvers directly to

558
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,830
the browser because we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the</font>

559
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,720
operating system to do lookups anyway

560
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,399
because they do things with v6 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

561
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,020
don't agree with so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

562
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,250
completely bypass the operating system

563
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,960
get our own network socket we're going

564
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,910
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of our own DNS we're going to</font>

565
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,790
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of our own connection building</font>

566
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,530
and of course all of the different

567
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,799
browser people did their own and all the

568
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,170
OSS did their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own because the nice thing</font>

569
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:16,800
about standards is there so many

570
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:20,430
choose from so Jeff Houston<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an</font>

interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> character @ap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick decided</font>

572
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:25,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some research and so he went off</font>

573
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,430
and he found the major flavors of

574
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,500
browsers on the major flavors of

575
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,510
operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems and he decided to see</font>

576
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,250
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would happen as he did various</font>

577
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,480
things with breaking his<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and not</font>

578
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:38,070
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Howard work and shockingly enough he</font>

579
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,500
discovered that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they all did things</font>

580
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,060
differently and they all solved some

581
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,010
problems much better than others<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

582
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:47,610
also some problems much worse than

583
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:50,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">others and user experience vary widely</font>

584
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,280
depending on what combination of OS and

585
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,900
browser you used he also discovered that

586
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was I think about a year</font>

587
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,610
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half ago he first did this</font>

588
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,900
that version of OSX had some fundamental

589
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,550
problems because they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing a</font>

590
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:08,310
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job breaking these six at</font>

591
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:11,820
the time and this was suboptimal hence

592
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:14,399
hampering eyeballs windows actually

593
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do the right thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what they</font>

594
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,850
decided was it's silly to have every

595
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,160
application of the world doing random

596
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,919
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it makes support the night</font>

597
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,660
here let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

598
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,910
response and we'll put it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

599
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,770
network shim layer and everything

600
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:32,360
including our operating system and all

601
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,770
the apps will all be the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

602
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,659
unfortunately one of their working

603
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,580
assumptions of that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody</font>

604
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:43,260
on windows uses windows explorer as

605
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:45,030
their browser of choice and the vast

606
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,710
majority of people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least some of the</font>

607
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,620
time will use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chrome or will use Firefox</font>

608
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,600
even on Windows platform at which point

609
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,310
they have their own stuff resolvers in

610
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,620
the browsers and it ignores the

611
00:25:53,310 --> 00:26:01,909
operating system and we're back again so

612
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,729
one of the other fun things there's this

613
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,800
bad old job that I love about these two

614
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,510
guys in on reports just<font color="#E5E5E5"> debating what if</font>

615
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,120
what is the greatest invention of

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,830
humankind and they are putting back

617
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,159
before the one of them find he says the

618
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:18,470
thermos is the greatest invention<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

619
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">very puzzled what do you mean says what</font>

620
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,340
keeps hot things hot and keeps cold

621
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:27,169
things cold the only other thing I just

622
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:32,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't understand is how do it no well we</font>

623
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:34,160
have a similar problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ipv6 unlike</font>

624
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,970
before where there is one address /

625
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:43,070
interface in v6 you can have multiple

626
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:46,630
prefixes all on one interface you can

627
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:49,310
have multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses privacy and</font>

628
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:54,020
globally routable for each of those

629
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:57,500
prefixes and they all come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go and</font>

630
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:00,200
they they're kept around long enough to

631
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,630
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask existing connections but they may</font>

632
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,980
be existing is deprecated and not being

633
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,350
used for new connections but still

634
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">around and then at some point they</font>

635
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:14,510
disappear completely an external<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack</font>

636
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:17,210
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am opening of the network</font>

637
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,490
connection my first problem of course is

638
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:24,610
choosing before v6 but let's assume that

639
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:29,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> choosing v6 and I have two prefixes</font>

640
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:34,280
one ula of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> GA I have privacy</font>

641
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,800
addresses on so I have both my eui-64

642
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,840
based and my randomly privacy based

643
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:43,550
versions of all of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have linked</font>

644
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,709
local and how do I choose well of course

645
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:48,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ITF had some interesting ideas they</font>

646
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,350
said that's a complicated question for

647
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:54,860
which we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a complicated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

648
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:58,629
and they started with RFC 3484 and

649
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:02,629
after some input on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they been</font>

650
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:06,440
updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently 67 24 and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basic</font>

651
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,809
idea is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I look at who I'm</font>

652
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,270
sending the packet to that should give

653
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:13,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">me some very strong clues about what I</font>

654
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:19,010
should use as my address<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send from</font>

655
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:21,530
because if I am sending to a an address

656
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:24,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is a prefix in which I'm configured</font>

657
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,670
I'm in the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> address trunk as it it's</font>

658
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not a bad assumption that it's</font>

659
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:32,030
the same enterprise company organization

660
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,440
security zone whatever and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the best</font>

661
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,210
address that i should use should be the

662
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,000
one that tells the other guy hi I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

663
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,799
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fool you are if I'm</font>

664
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,440
sending the link local I really probably

665
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:45,490
shouldn't use my global unicast address

666
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,750
aight<font color="#E5E5E5"> republic you smiley cloak and</font>

667
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,700
there are some other considerations you

668
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">know with different prefix lanes like</font>

669
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,940
you know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have the same prefix but</font>

670
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,440
two different lengths because I'm

671
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,600
configured in two different areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

672
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,790
some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you consider there's</font>

673
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,309
some things like scope and what types of

674
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,780
addresses and you shouldn't use

675
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:06,700
deprecated addresses four new

676
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:09,200
connections only<font color="#CCCCCC"> for existing ones and</font>

677
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all goes through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

678
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,470
starting to sound pretty complicated and

679
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:13,428
after all that you then go through that

680
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and there's this whole</font>

681
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision tree of all the stuff that you</font>

need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to be in the</font>

683
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,390
kernel because it's the one constructing

684
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,470
the package that spits out the wire and

685
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,880
of course it wasn't complicated enough

686
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,799
because somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> said well what if I</font>

687
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,760
don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what if I have a</font>

688
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:34,520
security reason for overriding certain

689
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,840
addresses I need the option of control

690
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,250
of my host because it's my host I should

691
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,379
be able to put whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> sources dress I</font>

692
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,490
want and the IDS said well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

693
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,280
wonderful that yes you should have

694
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,840
complete economist control so not only

695
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">do you have all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these complicated</font>

696
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,939
algorithms you can conceivably on a

697
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,490
proposed basis have local overrides

698
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,290
which have been changed it and with

699
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,090
those boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may even have users who</font>

700
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,080
mistakenly did interesting things

701
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,779
because they saw something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Google</font>

702
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,519
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> change something and it doesn't</font>

703
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:07,289
match the others so you have users

704
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,730
because we all have users because that's

705
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:12,960
why we have networks sadly enough and

706
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:16,860
they call<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up when things don't work</font>

707
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,840
and they expect us to fix them we of

708
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,549
course naively expect them to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

709
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,750
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us enough useful information that</font>

710
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:24,769
hopefully we can figure out what the

711
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,630

<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so think back to the last several</font>

713
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:33,960
minutes of conversation you have

714
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:35,549
multiple addresses that come and go what

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get pissed off and going and</font>

00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:40,230
decide to have breakfast and come back

717
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:42,149
and then call<font color="#E5E5E5"> support and and your</font>

00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:45,750
addresses in your interface and you can

720
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,309
somehow walk them through that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">be the addresses they had when they had</font>

722
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:53,580
the problem and even if you get all the

addresses you have to get the user to

necessarily what they were sending to

727
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,889
because as will also know even though

728
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,570
we'd like to get useful information

it into your ticketing system so even if

you wrote tools where you could simply

where we may start putting packet

the information we need to debug some of

761
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:39,490
these problems so that's some of the

things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know there are a number</font>

out so default routes are fun you know

00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,460
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> first heard that you could</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have multiple default routes</font>

them and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you claim that</font>

you are a v6 compliant stack you have to

finding hsrp and brrp can go we don't

every<font color="#CCCCCC"> coast we don't to run all this</font>

virtual MAC addresses virtual IP and all

those other hideousness that we've had

781
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,070
for years so that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to run</font>

an active routing protocol on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a post</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming that this actually works</font>

784
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,990
what we have discovered as a collective

00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,270
community is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that not all the OSS</font>

786
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:48,130
necessarily did default routes and

787
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:49,360
multiple routes right at my company we

788
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,950
actually ran into a problem with an

789
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,929
older version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> douro where it</font>

790
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:58,030
would fall over but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would never fall</font>

791
00:33:52,930 --> 00:34:01,780
back and in some cases it wouldn't fall

792
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:03,160
over it would correctly say I have to

793
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">default routes but it wouldn't actually</font>

794
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:09,190
use the fact when the primary

795
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:14,530
away they fixed that but OSS or software

796
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:18,490
and software is buds so the theory is

797
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,980
lovely and it does also it's another one

798
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:23,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those interesting new bug problems</font>

799
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:27,879
because you now need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

800
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:31,089
default route your users got whether the

801
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:33,399
OS correctly got the priorities correct

802
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:35,349
and at the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> which routers weren't</font>

803
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,690
weren't available so once again you're

804
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:42,520
into a lot of this is very time and

805
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:43,899
context-sensitive other this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

806
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,500
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a weird collection of random</font>

807
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:49,270
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have found is just sort of</font>

808
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,270
the range of how much fun we're going to

809
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:57,579
have one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them was we had a customer</font>

810
00:34:52,270 --> 00:35:02,349
who their security people had decided

811
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:05,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a stateful firewall was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correct</font>

thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect their recursive DNS</font>

813

server which of course means that you've

814
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:17,680
taken a stateless UDP based protocol and

815
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:21,970
turned it<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a state full congestive</font>

816
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,288
more fragile problem and they knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

817
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,640
was wrong but they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting with</font>

818
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,869
their security people and in the

819
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,308
meantime they were discovering that it

820
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:30,880
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> indeed less fragile because what</font>

821
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:35,349
happened was they were suddenly getting

822
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:39,250
this flood of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuate a 96 DARPA requests</font>

823
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:42,279
hundreds of second which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for</font>

824
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:44,230
their server but that many requests

825
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:46,390
going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> filled the state table so</font>

826
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:49,359
legitimate dns lookups for their users

827
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:51,549
were failing and so they were going off

828
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,710
of what we have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> six specifically</font>

829
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:56,680
disabled everywhere we've gone out we've

830
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:59,020
actually turned it off and we're puzzled

831
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,990
and so they've come to us because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work</font>

832
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,330
in the ipv6 group of my company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

833
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,368
or what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong and so we finally</font>

834
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">figured out let's figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

835

hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a little</font>

836
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult because they in theory</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am</font>

837
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,570
happy six on but they discovered they

838
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,619
did in some places what was happening

839
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:24,600
was ax or a bug that if you disable v6

840
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:28,800
whenever it booted it sent this<font color="#E5E5E5"> flood</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

v6 related<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS curtains and this was</font>

842
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,770
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of surface or</font>

843
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,560
something where they would reboot four

00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,690
or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machines at a time and</font>

845
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,700
every time they did this all dns

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:45,480
resolution through the stateful firewall

847
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">and of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution shouldn't</font>

849
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,060
least what they want to do is they

850
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,650
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in packet filters they</font>

and they they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some stuff</font>

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,910
with DNS filtering and they figured out

it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> ugly but it's another one of</font>

totally sure that v6 only is supported

911
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,770
the various combinations of am and opens

912
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:42,850
with no previous configuration in any of

913
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:44,860
the hosts and see what they do then we

914
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:48,610
will actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network policy</font>

915
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:50,080
by changing the am and obits in a

916
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:52,210
network or clients have already either

917
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:56,500
auto configure broken leases or both and

918
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:58,540
see how they change and what he

919
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:04,360
discovered was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three major operating</font>

920
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:06,310
systems had wildly variant like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

921
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,200
them would drop dhcp leases immediately

922
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,130
the other word would keep the lease

923
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,290
until it expired and then would move on

924
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:16,540
which with one day leases means that

925
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,740
some chunk of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network acts</font>

926
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,509
completely differently with different

927
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:24,178
dresses than others<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bron being wrong</font>

928
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:26,489
then said<font color="#CCCCCC"> well okay so the OS vendors</font>

929
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:28,019
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously some of them must have</font>

930
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:30,359
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wrong and failed to follow the</font>

931
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:34,078
rfcs so we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of the</font>

933
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,969
bids are configured and what the

934
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:43,229
expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior is what he discovered</font>

935
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:45,269
was that the verbiage in some of the

936
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:47,368
core<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC's that have been around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

937
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:49,319
decade or<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer but have not been</font>

938
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:51,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">reviewed carefully in operational</font>

939
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:54,058
environments were sufficiently ambiguous

940
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:56,069
that you could make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument that</font>

941
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:59,969
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one of those vendors had</font>

942
00:40:56,069 --> 00:41:02,130
not violated the rfcs they were protocol

943
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:05,549
conformant they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply not at all</font>

944
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,929
interoperable were consistent so there

945
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:09,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">are two useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them is</font>

946
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:11,159
Appendix A is very useful to all of us

947
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:13,619
because we can look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it know when</font>

948
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,659
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change our network what</font>

949
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,579
families of OSS will have which behavior

950
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:19,949
so we at least known can plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

951
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:21,809
fact that we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a days</font>

952
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:24,179
difference between the linux boxes in

953
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:28,859
the mac or the windows boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

954
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:32,699
they behave the longer task and thus

955
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:36,569
carrier task is we now know that these

956
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:40,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">things are ambiguous but some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

it all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that were bent because</font>

reap<font color="#CCCCCC"> ick every wound that you</font>

long it took you to get the draft out

last time is usually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole on will</font>

take you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a bit set and of course</font>

981
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,740
what are the OS vendors do because until

982
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,118
they have some fear indication they're

983
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,700
all hoping that they're the one that

984
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,470
that is closest to correct and that the

985
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">other guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to have to code so</font>

if I go and say the standards are flawed

989
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:53,500
we need to change our product the first

990

question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be what customer</font>

991
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,630
isn't buying our gear because of this

problem and what other customer will

993
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,970
cause a support nightmare when we change

1036
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,520
clean our code in our configs for things

1037

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were really broken in regular DNS</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works correctly in dual static</font>

1043
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,670
and so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly one of the</font>

1044
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,830
things you can point your coders to as a

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm hoping you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know maybe some</font>

of you have some well I call them

1048
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,710
amusing stories because i have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

bitter and twisted sense of humor but

00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:35,860
share what you've been doing of course

1051
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:40,780
the next bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun CPEs because</font>

1052
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:42,550
consumer gear is always special as in

<font color="#E5E5E5">writes the short bus wears a helmet to</font>

school special but and b6 of course has

1055
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,750
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of changes we're not seeing it</font>

1056
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,900
yet you know in before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got one</font>

1057
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:59,800
address and then you nad at everything

1058
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:03,700
to usually 192 168 1 or 192 168 0 and

1059
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,680
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how 99% of the world works well</font>

1060
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:09,750
at least they are saying gee we should

1061
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:12,250
give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real v6 subnet in v6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1062
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:15,160
that's less controversial than it used

1063
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:17,470
to be there are still providers are

1064
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,879
saying home should get a / 64 which is

1065
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,649
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> one single subnet because you</font>

1066
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,350
can't subdivide below that it breaks

1067
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,360
slack and it breaks the number of bad

1068
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:27,640
stacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume the right no 64 bits</font>

1069
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,990

<font color="#E5E5E5">to have bad code and expedient</font>

1071
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:36,370
assumptions it will be all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gear in a</font>

1072
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:39,850
house so prefix delegation where you

1073
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:43,710
actually can allow the whole prefix

1074
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:47,020
56 or 48 or whatever to be handed to the

1075
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:50,110
main router connected to your cable

1076
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:54,670
modem or<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSL modem and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1077
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:56,950
subdivides is happening but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

1078
00:46:54,670 --> 00:47:01,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be able to do prefix</font>

1079
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:05,470
delegation and fortunately most of the

1080
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:07,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">brass clam and all of the other provider</font>

1081
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,950
gear is now getting there in docsis

1082
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:12,270
three has made this a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier because</font>

1083
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of that stuff is built in there</font>

1084
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:16,450
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still need things within the</font>

1085
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:19,120
home that also asked for subnet if

1086
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:21,520
you're doing hierarchical which is the

1087
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:25,420
grand scheme eventually and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

1088
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,210
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that CDE gear is fun is much</font>

1089
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:31,540
like the old days of consumer pc stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1090
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:34,240
can shave 25 cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> aboard off of my</font>

1091
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,950
wholesale cost and all i do is make your

1092
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,500
life a total living hell and make this a

1093
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:40,060
support nightmare and I'm I'm cheaper

1094
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:44,380
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next guy in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet my win</font>

1095
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:49,540
and cpe gear is all built<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

1096
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:55,390
assumption that 299 is better than three

1097
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:57,670
dollars to the consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that 275 is</font>

1098
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:02,470
a huge win and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask how you</font>

1099
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:07,680
saved a quarter they save a quarter by

1100
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:10,720
hiring interns to write code by using

1101
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,589
public domain open source code that has

1102
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,589
been deprecated for the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years</font>

1103
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:19,480
all sorts of interesting little tricks

1104
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:21,840
quick little sidelight um open resolvers

1105
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,660
in the open resolver project there were

1106
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,740
one of the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a distributed</font>

1107
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:30,220
denial of service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS amplification</font>

1108
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:32,290
is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an open resolver it</font>

1109
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a large bore shotgun waiting to</font>

1110
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:38,920
be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by botnets to hammer the victim</font>

1111
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:41,290
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your choice and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've gotten it</font>

1112
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,750
down somewhat<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was at 31 million open</font>

1113
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,190
resolvers a month month and a half ago I

1114
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:50,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's</font>

1115
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:54,119
to the 24 25 million so progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1116
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,279
that's 25 million resolvers well we can

1117
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,800
all sit there we can say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know all of</font>

1118
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,450
the the DNS servers should have apples

1119
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,650
on them in and all providers should be

1120
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:07,680
doing various filtering and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1121

already do the problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:50,790
waste a half day from work to wait for

1134
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:52,790
the repair guy you're 44 years easy to

1135
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:55,410
any kind of significant role out and

1136
00:49:52,790 --> 00:50:00,869
there are literally millions of these

1137
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:02,339
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with old crusty code and there</font>

1138
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:04,290
are people who just do broken stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1139
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:06,720
have an old apple airport express study

1140
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:08,520
I just moved recently and much of my

1141
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,049
stuff is in boxes but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my little</font>

1142
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,720
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I travel with the hotel so i</font>

1143
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:13,859
can get wireless and share<font color="#CCCCCC"> my connection</font>

1144
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,459
that they want to charge me per machine

1145
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:19,500
for and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said well you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

1146
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:23,040
got comcast comcast<font color="#CCCCCC"> sv6 and I have my</font>

1147
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,690
shiny new docsis three cable modem Lin

1148
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,009
I'll just stick my Airport Express on it

1149
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:32,130
because it does v6 sort of it's sort of

1150
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:33,690
does prefix delegation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wound up</font>

1151
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to in a way that was broken enough that</font>

1152
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:39,690
it confused comcast and I wound up going

1153
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:41,550
to their 624 service for my v6 even

1154
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:44,910
though they had native b6 available and

1155
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:47,280
correct prefix delegation this is an

1156
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:49,770
older model that the most current code

1157
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,240
from a real vendor and I actually have

1158
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:53,130
updated so I'm actually ahead of your

1159
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,950
average consumer who has a six or eight

1160
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,330
year old piece of gear I had to replace

1161
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,980
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1162
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:02,029
real router before prefix delegation

1163
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:03,290
worked which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine because you know</font>

1164
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,790
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found the right box that they've</font>

1165
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:08,860
carefully hidden it in because movers

1166
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:11,630
are interesting people too it worked

1167
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:14,090
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are tests and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right has a whole</font>

1170
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,270
and you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with a</font>

here's what we prefer you use because

00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">this will actually work with v6 and</font>

we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to promote v6 there are</font>

all of their cable provider members and

00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:40,160
they've done a lot to push this out and

1180

large providers like<font color="#CCCCCC"> free and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comcast</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of bottom line concerns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean comcast</font>

1183
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:49,130
originally did all of this because they

were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> their third round of network</font>

ten for different customer clouds and

1186
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:54,049
they were getting tired of having have

1187
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,450
the knots have three different

1190
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:06,379
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually went to v6 simply because</font>

it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> killing they're not but yes those</font>

that they know it will actually work as

through specious little arguments like

that and give actual report and of

bet a beer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the beer beds</font>

1223
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,460
nap and I immediately went up and said I

1224
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:28,040
better beer that someone will write<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT</font>

1226
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,800
why would you need that 66 that's it for

<font color="#CCCCCC">yes bro I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said it's very simple pci</font>

individually addressable from the

1241
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,830
outside so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one more impediment to</font>

1242
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,660
attacking individual machines which is

00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:07,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct but it is a stateful firewall</font>

1244
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,529
part of it which you could recreate with

1245
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,440
a stateful firewall it's not that

1246
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,880
inherently that does that but the

1247
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,030
security world in many cases has

1248
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:20,359
erroneously conflated those two

1249
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:22,030
therefore they if you doing pci

1251
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:27,740
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use a stateful firewall and not</font>

1252
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,230
do now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to go through second</font>

1253
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:33,049
several extra steps and some auditors

1254
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:35,750
will still ping you so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:38,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue with these people and throw</font>

your hands and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Matt Matt 66 it</font>

1258
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,340
will happen but at least four houses we

no longer need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

do internet updates thanks yeah I love

1274
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,299
not watching TV for half an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:36,120
i'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a software upload but it's</font>

00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:39,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening and most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us have a home</font>

1277
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,770
office we have if we have kids we have

1278
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
kids<font color="#CCCCCC"> who after they finish the homework</font>

1279
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,580
are going to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play World</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1280
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,250
Warcraft or halo or whatever else or get

1281
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:49,920
on xbox and you want to be able to

1282
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:51,090
segregate that traffic out so that the

1283
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,740
video conference that you're actually

1284
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:55,620
getting paid to do from your house is

1285
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:59,310
not torched by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> xbox session that</font>

1286
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:01,259
your kid is you so we're already moving

1287
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:03,380
to a point where having a hierarchical

1288
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:09,120
network in a house actually makes sense

1289

00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:16,080
suggestions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how we can make that</font>

1292
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">simpler but there is very little</font>

argument that we need more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a 64</font>

1294
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,660
there are dabassisst how big that should

00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:26,160
be there of course you know Owen DeLong

and the a Chiefs of the world through to

internet connections are 48 or shorter

1300
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:41,220
no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> should give out longer than 48 to</font>

1301
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:43,980
anyone including a house<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool you</font>

1302
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:47,839
know I like the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having 64,000</font>

1303
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,840
subnets in my house sounds fun

1304
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:55,129
practically speaking most of the world

1305
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:57,360
you know another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my generic sleep</font>

1310
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:12,369
no do I want to explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mother</font>

1311
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:16,710
what a sudden it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no so there are some</font>

1312
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:19,119
debates I'm seeing 56 is fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

1313
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:20,740
the only thing I'll say is most of them

1314
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:25,030
probably make sense I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say</font>

1315
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:29,049
stick to nibble boundaries so 48 52 56<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

1316
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:31,600
feet I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend against 64 I</font>

1317
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:34,300
think that's bare minimum should be 60

1318
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,770
and probably 56 because as an industry

1319
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,480
we were very bad at predicting what will

1320
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:39,369
happen in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future usage</font>

1321
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,560
is then we wind up doing horrible

1322
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:43,750
contortions to get ourselves out of like

1323
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,790
classical routing to psycho was one of

1324
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:49,869
those but actively fun periods in my

1325
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:51,009
life so call their bluff you know

1326
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:52,600
they're saying you can't possibly ever

1327
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,460
run out of you six face it's just

1328
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,549
there's so many gods that will never

1329
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay fine so start allocating everything</font>

1330
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,310
and nibbles it's certainly a lot easier

1331
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it means that each one of those</font>

1332
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">little hex characters and the address</font>

1333
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you type out it's a nibble so</font>

1334
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:10,920
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not dividing in the middle of a</font>

1335
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:14,410
letter I another one of my beer beds is

1336
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,730
that really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> large even really</font>

1337
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,470
really large number that we can't quite

1338
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,600
quantify in our mind is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not infinite</font>

1339
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:22,830
infinite is still way bigger than really

1340
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:26,680
really large and I have a beer bet that

1341
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:30,310
right now blowing off his English paper

1342
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:32,470
and and playing Assassin's Creed is

1343
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:35,770
somebody who will have an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1344
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:37,169
something that will not use a real data

1345
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:40,509
structure and he will decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1346
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:44,020
sucking up ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> subnet somehow is easier</font>

1347
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:45,970
and whatever it is will actually be

1348
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:48,160
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lots of consumers will</font>

1349
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:50,770
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use and every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1350
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">you run any will suck huge amounts of</font>

1351
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,590
subnet we will suddenly get to a point

1352
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:59,500
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are exhausting what was</font>

1353
00:58:53,590 --> 00:59:02,859
inexhaustible so<font color="#CCCCCC"> someday lots of people</font>

1354
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,150
will be buying me beer there is the

1355
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:09,069
routing problem with

1356
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:10,930
prefix delegation and to some degree

1357
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:12,910
that's look at hip net on their own

1358
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,038
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of proposals the IPF of course is</font>

1359
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,598
now recommending that the way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">around all of this in dude topology</font>

1362
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:22,390
home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the rest is to simply use</font>

1363
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:26,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">hiya sayest for all the routers in the</font>

1364
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:27,250
house and another<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

1365
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:34,390
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to support my mother</font>

1366
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:38,109
running is is in the house yeah but they

1367
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:39,670
are think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it yeah oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but she could</font>

1368
00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:43,720
use always be ever she thinks up<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1369
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:46,900
advice is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to complicate it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then so</font>

1370
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:50,740
you obviously don't real really deal

1371
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:53,890
with actual people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job one of</font>

1372
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,629
the other bits of fun PTR as well a

1373
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:59,078
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of history way back in the</font>

1374
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:01,660
dark ages I worked at yet and it was one

1375
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:03,309
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two large ftp archives that was</font>

1376
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually there were several deck had one</font>

1377
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:08,140
as well and Washington University st.

1378
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,700
Louis had one and we got to the stage

1379
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,890
where the part founder<font color="#CCCCCC"> McAdams was</font>

1380
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:14,259
getting very tired<font color="#CCCCCC"> of getting email from</font>

1381
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:18,520
people who didn't understand what their

1382
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:21,789
password was for anonymous FTP and being

1383
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,440
rich he<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide he simply wanted an</font>

1384
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:25,869
automated solution so what he did was he

1385
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,390
said okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you try and connect to our</font>

1386
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:29,920
ftp server and there is no PTR record

1387

1388
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,930
with will simply say your PTR records

1389
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:36,880
were broken go away and either they will

1390
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:41,470
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away or it was honest mistakes will</font>

1391
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,029
fix it and the email traffic should<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

particular alias went down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:47,859
declared victory and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> if some point</font>

1394
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:49,000
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to this point where i believe q</font>

1395
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:50,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">mail was the one that was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

1396
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,119
aberrant we were getting people who had

01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:57,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing stupid stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so he said screw</font>

1399
01:00:54,490 --> 01:01:01,040
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he had eric ahlman put in a</font>

1401
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,029
TR look up and if you didn't have

1402
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:08,330
forward reverse matching we said go away

1403
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:10,550
we don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you and other</font>

1404
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:13,480
people started using it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

1407
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:21,110
you have a PT our router and you won't

1408
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,300
get certain content if your provider

1409
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,400
didn't do that right and so what's

1410
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,520

it was a bad idea and how do we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,090
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us were UNIX geeks and so we</font>

1422
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,440
would either write scripts or then

1423

eventually of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like fine</font>

01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,620
sort of dollar generate these days

1425
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,759
they're even commercial products

1426
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:02,180
including my companies that will

1427
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,650
actually pre generate everything in the

1428
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:08,240
world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want with very fancy</font>

1429
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:10,460
options ok so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so I</font>

1430
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,229
get a you know a / 22 and I

1431
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,990
pre-configure all of it in my zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

1432
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:20,390
done well a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of v6 math a</font>

1433
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:23,479
single subnet in v6 is a 64 which is 18

1434
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:26,440
quintillion IP addresses which is four

1435
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:29,750
billion times<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 billion which is a lot</font>

1436
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:33,380
the DNS label itself is 34 labels long

1437
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:37,250
because this is the 32 nibbles<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus IP 6</font>

1438
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:39,980
plus ARPA so we're talking you know 80

1439
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:41,960
to 100 bytes per individual record so if

1440
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:44,840
you take 18 quintillion and add two more

1441
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:48,500
zeros<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it which is a number i don't</font>

01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,850
actually hold a file that big and we

1444
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,770

I've seen slack and certainly where I

1472

that DNS second that breaks because the

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's a lovely thought before</font>

and basically all you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you've</font>

1527
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:11,459
multicast messages are used for many

1528
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:13,709
things including good address detection

1529
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,450
because the dhcp server doesn't do that

1530
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,800
anymore so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you</font>

1533
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:24,060
you cannot ask for route advertisement

1534
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:26,279
messages nor receive router

1535

advertisement messages without icmpv6

1536
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:33,329
which means you get no default gateway

1537
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:34,589
you get no dhcp you get no dns you get

1538
01:06:33,329 --> 01:06:36,630
none of the other sub do we get those

1539
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:40,349

that can only send 2k upstream what it

that sort of gradually shrinks down to

01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:16,589
the smallest amount that will fit

1554
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:18,720
through every pipe in the path so what

1555
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:21,029
happens is some random box somewhere out

1556
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,339
in the internet way away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> you throws</font>

did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it an actually excellent job in</font>

1575
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:09,390
writing an RFC that explains sort of the

1576
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:11,790
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the things you really can't</font>

1577
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:13,830
turn off without breaking v6 completely

1578
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:16,649
here are the things that if you're doing

1579
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:18,028
this like mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 you will need if</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it turn them off and</font>

1581
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:21,089
then certain things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

1582
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:22,410
nobody other than a research lab should

01:08:21,089 --> 01:08:24,330
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and it sort of breaks the</font>

1584
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:26,339
mountain to those broad categories so my

1585
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:29,700
recommendation is that you get this RFC

1586
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:31,380
you print it out you carefully paste it

1587
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,490
to a very large board and when you get

1588
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of these I want to turn off all</font>

1589
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:36,479
icmpv6 you take the board you count<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1590
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:41,750
on the head until they were lent and

1591
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:47,608
then tell them to read that RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1592
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:50,250
ipsec this is one of those lovely

1593
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:52,319
stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are two things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

1594
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">always hear about ipv6 one of them</font>

1595
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,069
courses there so many addresses will

1596
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:58,049
never run out and I've already given my

1597
01:08:56,069 --> 01:09:01,319
really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> large it's not infinite</font>

1598
01:08:58,049 --> 01:09:04,740
there's another one ipsec is veteran and

1599
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">IV 6v6 is more secure because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i three</font>

1600
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,880
sectors design in from the beginning as

1601
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:12,120
part of the protocol it wasn't glued on

1602
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,279
the side afterwards and this starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1603
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:19,620
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> once upon a time and ends with day and</font>

1604

they lived<font color="#CCCCCC"> happily ever after the way it</font>

1605
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:28,160
really works the RFC that specifies

1606
01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:32,970
ipsec did say must now says should

1607
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:34,589
should support ipsec US government has

1608
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:37,350
mandated that they still require must

1609
01:09:34,589 --> 01:09:38,839
anyway but that really wasn't the big

1610
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:40,529
problem the problem was that they said

1611
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:43,408
should

1612
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:47,400
worked IP second and they failed to

1613
01:09:43,408 --> 01:09:49,408
define what support was which meant that

1614
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:52,500
all of the OS vendors got to define

1615
01:09:49,408 --> 01:09:55,170
support and the way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> defined support</font>

1616
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,699
was we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> shift software on the</font>

1620
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:08,940
and unfortunately also one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1621
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,589
the ITF failed to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

securely sharing key material with the

1627
01:10:23,639 --> 01:10:28,110

symmetric keys that are pre-configured

1633

bad news good news is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing</font>

have a relatively short attention span

they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the shiny new problem</font>

1669
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:23,019
and so they are continually adding

01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,420
things and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> things more complex</font>

01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:28,480
and elegant is usually the term they use

1672
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:31,690
I use complex and adding more and more

stuff even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though the base stuff isn't</font>

there yet this is now three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months a</font>

1675
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:44,830
little bit there are literally as many

drafts working right now or more in the

1677

process related to be 6m dhcpv6 then

1678
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:56,320
there are rfcs and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1679
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:58,660
an average of thirty pages per RFC

01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">across all the rfcs and if you have to</font>

01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:02,019
actually go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and read some of the</font>

into an RFC it would be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

aggressive to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody might</font>

write a reference implementation within

three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that is finished it</font>

1716
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:43,480
would be as aggressive to say that

1717
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:45,460
within three months they might be ready

1718
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:48,910
at the point where some customers might

be baby testing whatever this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another</font>

three months actually get it into

production for the vendor and another

1722
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:57,370
three months for you to roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out</font>

1723
01:14:54,090 --> 01:15:00,520
enterprise or network-wide those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1724
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:03,760
stupidly aggressive but what that you

1725
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:06,100
says is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 months from the art RFC</font>

useful in your backbone or on your

1728
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:14,380
enterprise is a stupidly aggressive

1729
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:17,739
schedule so if you aren't going to the

1730
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:21,280
IETF now and saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need this where I</font>

01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:22,989
can't roll out v6 you're a year and a

<font color="#CCCCCC">half to two years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away from having a</font>

01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:32,739

other<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits of fun that we're just now</font>

1736
01:15:32,739 --> 01:15:38,139
discovering one of the ones there is an

servers I'm a dual status post because

1739
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:46,300
that's what the ITF recommends is the

1740
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:48,730
most stable transition technology so I

1741
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:50,739
do mine dhcp before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a dress</font>

1742
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:53,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a fall travel together and</font>

1743
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:56,559
I get a list of DNS resolvers to use and

1744
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this example I'll sumanth UNIX my</font>

1747
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:03,450
servicing now I can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link-local</font>

1748
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:07,379
I bring up<font color="#E5E5E5"> my v6 interface I can all</font>

1749
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:12,349
right message it tells me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DHCP and I</font>

1750
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:14,640
go off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP on one interface</font>

1751
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:18,360
and it gives me a bunch of DNS servers

1752
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,550
and because I'm multi interface I do

1753
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:22,410
multiple dhcpv6 is only one before but I

1754
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:23,580
can do multiple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> d sixes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idh</font>

1755
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,950

1757
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:35,280
get dns servers and what do i do first

1758
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:37,140
one wins last one wins keep them all if

1759
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,090
I do do I keep them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the order I got</font>

1760
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:44,640
them do I sort them if I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

1761
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:46,110
what order RFC 6731 says your cellular

1762
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,180
interface might need to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain</font>

1763
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:49,980
resolver because they're doing DNS magic

1764
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:51,660
than lying to you when you go over

1765
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:53,730
cellular but if used that same dns

1766
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:57,720
resolution on your local land it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1767
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:59,969
break and vice versa so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need a net</font>

1768
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:01,230
tears off comp that the kernel can talk

1769
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:04,560
to for every one of my network

1770
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:07,160
interfaces and I'm not aware of any

1771
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:10,380
operating system that deals with that

1772
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:13,500
there are a number of things along those

1773
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:15,660
lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> mythos multiple interface and as</font>

1774
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:19,050
you have multiple interfaces each of

1775
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:22,349
which might have administrative and

1776
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:25,080
network policies because of security or

<font color="#E5E5E5">cost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for cellular or speed or any number</font>

1778
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,220
of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you essentially wind up</font>

1779
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:31,380
having virtual networks and virtual

1780
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:33,690
operating systems that have to be

1781
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:37,890
segmented for every network interface

1782
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:40,440
and so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> holy working room to</font>

1783
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:42,360
deal with that pki of course is another

1784
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:44,339
they still can't agree on a PKM I

1785
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:47,339
infrastructure and it's impeding a

1786
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:50,400
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things other than doing things</font>

1787
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:52,050
like I'd be suck DNS SEC we're still

1788
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,420
having that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with you know we</font>

1789
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:57,450
have 50 11 and some automated ways in

1790
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:58,800
theory of pushing des records up but we

1791
01:17:57,450 --> 01:18:02,970
really aren't there yet there are a

1792
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:05,280
series of operational issues and there's

1793
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:07,050
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of there but only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

1794
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that leap of trust and we all</font>

agreed that the week

01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:11,630
use the root for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS anyway therefore we</font>

1797
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:14,870
sign the route<font color="#CCCCCC"> and use that trust banker</font>

1798
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:17,710
we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solved it things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dayne</font>

1799
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:20,930
the idea of putting certificates into

1800
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:24,350
something possibly dns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x signing</font>

1801
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:26,240
it have the same problem you know we

1802
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:27,590
don't like the idea of certificate

1803
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:30,110
authorities because those are

1804
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:31,760
corruptible but then we get into the

1805
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:34,179
then who owns it as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get into</font>

1806
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,860
who owns it the IETF seems to freeze

1807
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:39,350
rpki for secure rowdy announcements is

1808
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:40,280
another they haven't yet figured out how

1809
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,660
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sharing and</font>

1810
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,070
distributing<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys well who's going to</font>

1811
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:45,110
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it how do you trust and all</font>

1812
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:48,860
the rest of it we keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> running for the</font>

1813
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:51,080
same problems over and over again so

1814
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:52,700
what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys do you can certainly</font>

1815
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group mailing lists</font>

1816
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:57,050
I will warn you most of them are

1817
01:18:54,380 --> 01:19:01,730
voluminous and painful but you certainly

1818
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:02,690
can you could come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IETF and I'm</font>

1819
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:05,599
actually gonna be doing a lightning talk

1820
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:07,009
possibly this this nanog about

1821
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,320
essentially having support group for

1822
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:11,060
operators who come because there are

1823
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,790
cultural things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen to the ITF</font>

1824
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:15,860
you need to be prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and there</font>

1825
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:17,240
are ways of working that are less

1826
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:19,519
constructive than others and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:21,769
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set things up so that it is</font>

01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as painful as it used to be but</font>

1829
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:25,460
realistically they don't announce the

1830
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:26,660
agenda until two weeks before you

1831
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,190
probably only have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two working groups</font>

1832
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,990
you need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means that</font>

1833
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours worth of work across</font>

1834
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:33,710
five working days you have to take off

1835
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:36,620
work and travel frequently overseas

1836
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:38,950
three times a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us don't have</font>

1837

the luxury of being sent ites regularly

1838
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:44,660
but you certainly can we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

1842
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:54,830
of you know can we get more input<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and</font>

1843
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:57,740
more visibility into ITF how would we do

1844
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:59,890
that and this may sound strange coming

1845
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:02,510
from a vendor but<font color="#E5E5E5"> beat on vendors</font>

1846
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:05,210
because I can't do anything I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go and</font>

1847
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:07,040
I can say this RFC just passed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1848
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:08,300
need to put it in because customers

1849
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,180
you're going to need it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the question</font>

01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:13,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get is what sale does this</font>

1851
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:16,400
affect and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars is that so</font>

1852
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:18,589
if you as customers don't say we're not

1853
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy so it's those gear until</font>

you support

01:20:19,469 --> 01:20:23,729
features or this v6 option where this

1856
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:26,940
RFC we have no way of getting

1857
01:20:23,729 --> 01:20:30,210
engineering resources so please<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1858
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:31,558
screen you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one of the things that I</font>

1859
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:33,150
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> say is that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

1860
01:20:31,559 --> 01:20:34,800
able to ever roll out most of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1861
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:36,360
capital budgets that are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> set and</font>

1862
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">of course if we're supposed to implement</font>

1863
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,380
v6 on top of that not given any extra

1864
01:20:38,249 --> 01:20:41,429
money well one thing you can do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1865
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,499
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a two-year hardware refresh</font>

1868
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:50,579
nothing that comes in the eye by will

1869
01:20:48,659 --> 01:20:53,518
not have v6 support or a solid

<font color="#E5E5E5">commitment roadmap for my vendor as soon</font>

1871
01:20:53,519 --> 01:20:56,280

and over those three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years the vendors</font>

1874
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:03,089
will finally get<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of their stuff</font>

1880
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:17,690
will have some justification for

questions comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories</font>

1883
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:33,630
hi Paul<font color="#E5E5E5"> good talk I've got a couple of I</font>

1884
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:36,450
guess comments and questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

1885
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:38,670
first of all I'm happy to hear you talk

1886
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:40,559
about prefix delegation and how

1887
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:45,900
important that is a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider</font>

1888
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:47,640
network you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm curious you know</font>

1889
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:50,070
what maybe your take is from a vendor

1890
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:53,010
perspective or what you're seeing you

1891
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the company I work for we work with</font>

1892
01:21:53,010 --> 01:22:00,270
a lot of telephone companies who have a

1893
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,130
lot of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use your subscribers</font>

1894
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:04,890
or as residential subscribers and

1895
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:06,200
everybody talks about vendor wise hey

1896
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:09,150
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out with these</font>

1897
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:11,400
residential gateways that no one talks

1898
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:13,080
about prefix delegation you know you ask

1899
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,990
them about that and you get the

1900
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:18,720
deer-in-the-headlights look and you know

1901
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:20,190
to me I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a big a huge deal</font>

1902
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:23,370
you know that's that's one of the big

1903
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:26,879
you know the biggest benefits of v6 is

1904
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:29,460
the ability to delegate multiple or a

1905
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,350
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix to the home that can be</font>

1906
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,240
used for multiple things and you know I

1907
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:36,360
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a security perspective it</font>

1908
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:39,300
makes a lot of sense you know I don't

1909
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">want maybe my directv box kicking us</font>

1910
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:44,070
feed around in the same network with my

1911
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:46,410
you know home computer whatever and

1912
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:49,230
quality of services at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least potentially</font>

1913
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:53,040
there or traffic shaping yes absolutely

1914
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:57,299
so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> my first question is what are</font>

1915
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:59,220
you seeing much on the the cpe front

1916
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,639
from that perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you know I</font>

1917
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,979
know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font>

1918
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,849
home vendors you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple and say</font>

1919
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:06,880
yeah we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build that</font>

1920
01:23:03,849 --> 01:23:08,800
functionality into our<font color="#CCCCCC"> ont s yeah well</font>

1921
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,889
that no they're not I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't</font>

1922
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:14,289
seen it yet I'm seeing more in terms of

1923
01:23:11,889 --> 01:23:16,419
set-top boxes being done in Europe with

1924
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:18,759
those capabilities than in the US but

1925
01:23:16,419 --> 01:23:24,189
set-top boxes in the US are going the

1926
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:26,559
way well I've seen less other than

1927
01:23:24,189 --> 01:23:29,530
Google most other vendors seem to reach

1928
01:23:26,559 --> 01:23:32,489
find other ways of doing things now but

1929
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:34,749
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to happen it is it is</font>

1930
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:35,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the problem of course you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

1931
01:23:34,749 --> 01:23:37,570
to any place where they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1932
01:23:35,709 --> 01:23:40,239
selling here the people there don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1933
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:41,590
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> six is but it's not an</font>

1934
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:43,629
accurate picture because they probably

1935
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:45,459
are developing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or have it it just</font>

1936
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:47,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't make the marketing literature and</font>

1937
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:49,300
when you're talking about submitting the

1938
01:23:47,229 --> 01:23:52,749
size of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco or or a falcon or a</font>

1939
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:55,419
similar until it's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little glossy to</font>

page at interop it doesn't exist but

1941
01:23:55,419 --> 01:23:59,648
prefix delegation is stomach coming a

1942
01:23:57,669 --> 01:24:01,719
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is because of some folks on</font>

1943
01:23:59,649 --> 01:24:03,760
time warner<font color="#E5E5E5"> comcast and some of the</font>

01:24:01,719 --> 01:24:05,889
other big<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks in the US have been</font>

1945
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:08,439
pushing a long time it has helped a lot

1946
01:24:05,889 --> 01:24:13,269
that dsl speeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> have not kept up with</font>

1947
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:14,769
cable speeds and and cable is becoming

1948
01:24:13,269 --> 01:24:17,169
more ubiquitous in more rural

1949
01:24:14,769 --> 01:24:21,820
communities and docsis three is already

1950
01:24:17,169 --> 01:24:24,340
done so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's helping right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1951
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:26,289
seeing it it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a while</font>

1952
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:29,289
or I'm actually not seeing it is

1953
01:24:26,289 --> 01:24:32,039
anything above consumer like you know

1954
01:24:29,289 --> 01:24:35,530
the small/medium business market an

1955
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:37,300
office sighs router I'm not seeing

1956
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:38,889
acceleration there and that's even more

1957
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:40,269
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place where I would think you would</font>

1958
01:24:38,889 --> 01:24:43,899
want it first for security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

1959
01:24:40,269 --> 01:24:45,130
reasons that even in the home but there

1960
01:24:43,899 --> 01:24:46,389
there's nobody pushing for it because

1961
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:49,479
businesses don't even know what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1962
01:24:46,389 --> 01:24:51,010
we're asked for or why they care<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

1963
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:53,559
phone companies are hesitant because

1964
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:56,199
they don't see a way of charging extra

1965
01:24:53,559 --> 01:24:57,610
for businesses in home they're being

1966
01:24:56,199 --> 01:25:00,119
forced to because they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the address</font>

1967
01:24:57,610 --> 01:25:02,199
space because of the sheer numbers so

1968
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:03,880
there's no pain point for the phone

1969
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:06,429
company so they have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivation the</font>

1970
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,470

01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:09,490
the gaps that I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it to</font>

1972
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,990
me it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense you know</font>

1973
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:12,880
especially for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I agree the</font>

1974
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:14,920
docsis folks seem to have their act

1975
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,650
together you know they they do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PV</font>

1976
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:20,530
they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> route insertion you know</font>

1977
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:23,650
everything else I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my next question</font>

1978
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:25,780
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Latin in my last question from a</font>

1979
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:30,219
deployment standpoint or you see most

1980
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:32,019
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a way inside doing so</font>

1981
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:35,500
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you have a dsl network or</font>

1982
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:39,730
fiber to the home network facing a group

1983
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:42,750
of subscribers so you see more stateless

1984
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:45,700
auto-configuration towards the

1985
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:48,220
subscribers<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interface and then the</font>

1986
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:50,080
prefix delegation being being done over

1987
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:52,180
that so in other words you know they do

1988
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:55,210
there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that they get to link</font>

1989
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:59,010
link local address with you know that on

1990
01:25:55,210 --> 01:26:01,690
that subnet they see the router

1991
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:04,420
advertisement they<font color="#E5E5E5"> build through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1992
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:07,780
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> before or whatever they have network</font>

1993
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:09,520
connectivity and then do a prefix

1994
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:11,620
delegation over that or people looking

1995
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:14,410
at doing some type of more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tunnel</font>

1996
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:16,900
approach on the land side or<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your</font>

1997
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:19,090
thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that I haven't had as</font>

1998
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,469
much exposure as I would like and yet

1999
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:23,860
the corner a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people but what</font>

2000
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:25,900
I'm seeing is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using DHCP for</font>

2001
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:27,820
the point-to-point link because it's

2002
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:30,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">very similar provisioning to the old PPO</font>

2003
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:32,380
EES and some of the other so it sort of

2004
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:36,160
makes sense to them and then they will

2005
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:39,130
prefix delegate to the land side of it

2006
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:42,220
and then it becomes whether it's 64 or

2007
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:44,620
it's actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't serve 64 a useful</font>

2008
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:47,170
prefix delegation it is but in but I are

2009
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:48,550
very useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're going to bother to</font>

2010
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:50,200
do prefix delegation and it actually

2011
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:55,240
works i feel you should give somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

2012
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:57,849
56 or at least a 60 but most people are

2013
01:26:55,240 --> 01:27:00,700
phasing and even comcast started out

2014
01:26:57,850 --> 01:27:02,260
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 64 and moved up ever they seem</font>

the dhcp prefix delegation for the LAN

01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:12,150
right anything less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

2019

2020
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:16,860
would make that smaller prefixes within

2021
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:18,750
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break everything</font>

2022
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:20,309
else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they're there are none</font>

2023
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:22,080
cheap stocks that have hard-coded that

2024
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:30,120
the right new 64 bits is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook they</font>

2025
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:32,850
will break yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks my name is</font>

2026
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:35,190
Jeremy I was just curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> i heard you</font>

2027
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:36,480
comment about<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon kind of coming up</font>

2028
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:42,240
the curve again so they committed to a

2029
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:43,500
date yet over ipv6 implementation they

2030
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:45,719
are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful about what they</font>

2031
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:49,710
announced in general and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

2032
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:53,030
engineers are carefully controlled so

2033
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:55,290
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though yeah I could hear rumors but</font>

2034
01:27:53,030 --> 01:28:02,610
there's still not enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business</font>

2035
01:27:55,290 --> 01:28:05,310
push yet amazon has enough before space

2036
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:10,250
right now that it's not impacting their

2037
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:12,510
virtual machine yet when they hit tilt

2038
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:13,890
if that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> change limelight did it</font>

2039
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:15,240
because their management was committed

2040
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:19,320
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> b6 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is why they've had it</font>

2041
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:20,849
the longest<font color="#E5E5E5"> Akamai had it because they</font>

2042
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,139
had all the government requirements for

2043
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:24,140
v6 and that was how much of the

2044
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:27,210
government sites were going to meet the

2045
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:34,260
last fall mandate that everyone is

2046
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:36,330
missed so yeah amazon has some

2047
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:38,010
government customers but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

2048
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">same leverage and so they're being</font>

2049
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:41,850
ignored and was also does a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

2050
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:43,380
custom stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> both a good and a</font>

2051
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:44,670
bad thing why<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike took so long when</font>

2052
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:46,590
they did there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon took so long</font>

2053
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:47,550
they did theirs because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not promote</font>

2054
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:51,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">off-the-shelf they're doing everything</font>

2055
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:54,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sense yeah actually work with</font>

2056
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:58,259
me call<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs we do a lot of tier 2 and 3</font>

2057
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:59,759
docsis work and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a bit of</font>

2058
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">a push now that you know some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

2059
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,900
larger guys have led the way but we're

2060
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,340
seeing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of issues obviously the</font>

2061
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,379
consumer year like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were saying so</font>

2062
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,000
when you're talking about larger prefix

2063
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,380
delegation I mean we're seeing issues

2064
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,210
with consumer devices right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now even</font>

2065
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:15,030
just taking a prefix much less anything

2066
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:16,770
larger number 64 so you see that that

2067
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:21,989
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trend going forward and you see</font>

2068
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:23,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">like maybe multiple 60 corners I've seen</font>

2069
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,919
usually one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two things if it's</font>

2070
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:29,940
relatively recent code from a relatively

2071
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:31,380
reputable vendor they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do</font>

2072
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,299
correct prefix delegation because they

2073
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:36,139
realize that take you 64 is prefix

2074
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:38,489
delegation and you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do it I</font>

2075
01:29:36,139 --> 01:29:40,110
haven't seen too many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:42,629
aware of that have actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard coded</font>

2077
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:45,150
getting 64 prefix delegation but not

2078
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:47,789
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to take a shorter prefix than</font>

2079
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:49,289
64 and you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

2080
01:29:47,789 --> 01:29:57,900
work to do that so I'm hopeful that

2081
01:29:49,289 --> 01:30:00,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody will be that overly club hi there</font>

space and actually dealing with Aaron we

2087
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:16,829
just consolidated I gave back a bunch of

2088
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:19,289
various blocks that we had distributed

2089
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:23,670
and tried to acquire a single larger

2090

actually thought we could reasonably

both before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be six they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

2110
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult in dealing with getting those</font>

2111
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:25,060
out and even though they're supposed to

2112
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:29,350
be encouraging v6 adoption by having

2113
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:31,360
more liberal policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've heard from</font>

2114
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:33,070
folks other than you that is what they

2115
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:37,630
say but does not see me what they

2116
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:39,570
allocated yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thinking you</font>

2117
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:42,130
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a cable market point of view</font>

2118
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:43,509
how right now we're spending a great

2119
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:46,480
deal of time figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how we're</font>

2120
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:49,540
going to deploy because you know we

2121
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">might actually be if we assume that</font>

2122
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to be deploying multiple</font>

2123
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:56,200
subnets to a home multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> 60 force to a</font>

2124
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:59,710
home in some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a nibble range that</font>

2125
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:02,710
we might actually be<font color="#CCCCCC"> short on TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 space</font>

2126
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:04,420
already yeah now the plus side is that

2127
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:08,410
everyone is doing sparse allocation so

2128
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:10,090
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a 36 what actually happens is</font>

2129
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:11,769
you get the front half of the 32 and

2130
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:13,150
they leave the back half of it available

2131
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:15,310
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for later so you can simply</font>

2132
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:18,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the prefix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lane so they are being</font>

2133
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:19,840
accommodating in that regard my emails

2134
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,400
on the slide if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to go through</font>

2135
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:25,380
there are some justifications you can

2136
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:29,110
use with some of the trends smart grid

2137
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:32,500
Internet of Things the fact that there

2138
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:35,259
are enough decent<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumer-grade</font>

2139
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:37,540
anything that is gamer rated routers

2140
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:40,180
these days are actually doing PD

2141
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:42,790
correctly and doing v6 correctly so a

2142
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,470
lot of that stuff if you scrape enough

2143
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:47,320
of those arguments together it might

2144
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:48,610
start to sway them but yet email me I

2145
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:52,320
can see if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can try and come up with</font>

2146
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:54,389
some some justification to chain

2147
01:32:52,320 --> 01:33:02,070
their mind because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it will be benefit</font>

2148
01:32:54,390 --> 01:33:04,620
to more than just you we're always

2149
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:07,080
anxious to hear feedback like this and

2150
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:10,080
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have policies that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't seem to</font>

2151
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:12,630
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> operationalized or policies are</font>

2152
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:18,570
incorrect there's quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us here</font>

2153
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:22,560
on the agenda great later in this panel

2154
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:26,700
so all of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> are anxious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear your</font>

2155
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:28,620
experiences and it thank you and I'd

2156
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:30,870
love to talk some it is also chicken<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

2157
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:32,309
egg I mean part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue is there</font>

2158
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:33,599
were very few providers that are

2159
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:36,690
actually pushing an awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

2160
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,070
providers started with the 64 and are

2161
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:41,070
gradually helping what they're handing

2162
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:42,929
out and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slow</font>

2163
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:45,000
because cpe equipment has not been there

2164
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:47,670
yet so we have so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

2165
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,200
lockstep and dragging this along so as

2166
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:50,820
long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everybody is willing to</font>

2167
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,380
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole theme of this</font>

2168
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:55,860
thing is it's we're going to be

2169
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:57,930
constantly changing everything including

2170
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:59,339
fundamental assumptions over the next

2171
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:01,140
several years as we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll this</font>

2172
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:03,690
stuff out as long as everybody's sort of

2173
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:05,070
prepared to roll their sleeves and deal

2174
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:07,190
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can get through</font>

2175
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font>

2176
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:13,339
heard both sides it is now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

2177
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:17,890
unplug and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're saying you know</font>

2178
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:21,530
there's no sentiment of conservatism in

2179
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:24,170
ipv6 addressing policy will use at all

2180
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:27,230
or something on the other hand we don't

2181
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:29,900
walk the limit you know deployments and

2182
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:31,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 56s or the things that happen and</font>

2183
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:33,139
the policy says it should happen and

2184
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:37,820
then should

2185
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:40,730
and bring that their vehicles bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

2186
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:48,740
to error and there's a desperate I

2187
01:34:40,730 --> 01:34:50,000
decided the door hit ya mi degrees thank

2188
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:52,010
you and yes it's the same thing I'd say

2189
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you know the ITF usually have found</font>

2190
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:55,190
on the ITF and some ITF first of all say

2191

know member service and enter in the

2195
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:07,760
same way that I can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

2196
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:09,620
fixed as a vendor until I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>
