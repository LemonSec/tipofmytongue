1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,099
coming up next we've got Larry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sandberg</font>

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:13,469
with BT I Larry morning I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,289
talk to you today about some advanced

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,789
development thinking that we're doing

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,850
which really means sort of describing an

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,279
alternate universe advanced development

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,289
is strange there is still an analogy

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,210
from from one of the sessions on the

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,710
first day it's it's a matter of trying

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,679
to skate to where the puck is going to

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,070
be and and you don't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where</font>

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">the puck is going to be I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> note</font>

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,640
that that over the course of my career

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,559
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up with</font>

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,149
lots of neat names for products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lots</font>

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">of neat acronyms for products and some</font>

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,930
are pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sock'em is not high on</font>

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,280
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> names but i can assure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,510
it's better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous to that</font>

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've had for this so it's a step forward</font>

21
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,180
so this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out of the the fact</font>

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,460
that for most of the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years I've</font>

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,320
been working as a technologist and an

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,880
architect in companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that build</font>

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,710
optical equipment packet equipment and

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,449
and more to the point packet optical

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,339
equipment and I've been distressed over

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,930
the course of all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time that that</font>

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,689
packet optical usually means packet and

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,310
optical not really packet optical the

31
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:33,048
the the coordination between the packet

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,600
layer and the optical layer has been

33
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:41,400
either non-existent or<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion very</font>

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:44,759
poor and a lot of this is clearly due to

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,350
the capabilities of some of the optical

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,380
hardware more than the packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware</font>

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,298
in my opinion and this is driven people

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,548
to design networks in particular ways

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:59,610
and and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

40
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:02,070
there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been no standard or calming</font>

41
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,409
control infrastructure and this is the

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,490
area that I've been focusing on in my

43
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,500
thinking and then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

44
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,350
about a little bit over the next few

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,390
minutes so

46
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,340
the problem is that that optical

47
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,970
transport is still thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as wires</font>

48
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,310
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of optical</font>

49
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,020
networks yet as dynamic entities at

50
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,450
least not in the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we packet</font>

51
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,820
people think of packet systems as

52
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,380
dynamic entities and you know part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

53
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,140
is just sort of the time scale we think

54
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing packet processing</font>

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,220
and packet switching we're thinking in

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,990
in microseconds in milliseconds and

57
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:43,030
seconds with today's<font color="#CCCCCC"> row domes optical</font>

58
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,810
infrastructure we can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making</font>

59
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes in days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and months fixed optical</font>

60
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,110
was months<font color="#E5E5E5"> in years and you know people</font>

61
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">who put in telephone wires were thinking</font>

62
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,790
in years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and decades and maybe even</font>

63
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,400
centuries so there's a different time

64
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,440
scale in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought process and again</font>

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,260
that thats related in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of</font>

66
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,570
optical optical equipment to the

67
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,829
capabilities of what's out there today

68
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:14,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">but with with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advent of some next</font>

69
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,950
generation Rotom hardware that's that's

70
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,690
coming down the pike right now for for

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,670
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called CDC Rotom zorkon</font>

74
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:33,250
can change drastically so today packet

75
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,190
switches are topology driven people put

76
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,020
in their optical networks first they put

77
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,359
the transport network in place they run

78
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,960
the fiber they light wavelengths that

79
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,240
could be either with transponders it

80
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,540
could be with rodents it could be with

81
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,420
embedded colored optics in the routers

82
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,030
and switches but the point the point is

83
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,880
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the fiber is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run and lip and</font>

84
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:02,260
then the packet switches are connected

85
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,940
and they see these connections that are

86
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,060
already lit and they talk to each other

87
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,420
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine the Jason sees and by</font>

88
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way everything here is is I'm trying</font>

89
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,589
to be agnostic to packet switching

90
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:20,200
technology i mean we build switches but

91
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,459
these could be these could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> LS RS or</font>

92
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">they could be routers they could be</font>

93
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,560
switches<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really not not the</font>

94
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,480
tenth of the discussion the point is

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the packets which is see each other</font>

96
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:36,190
over an existing link and they develop

97
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">adjacencies then they develop their</font>

98
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,750
forwarding paths they build their

99
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,969
forwarding tables or their their routing

100
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,640
tables whatever and then the services

101
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,990
are defined so you know to some extent

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:53,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is like building a road between</font>

103
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:56,170
pick two cities Boston and New<font color="#CCCCCC"> York and</font>

104
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,940
two possibilities one is you build the

105
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,010
straightest possible road between Boston

106
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,290
New York merely to find out that thirty

107
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,270
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traffic all exits at one</font>

108
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,730
place and travels ten miles on back

109
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,490
roads<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to a Depot or alternatively</font>

110
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:12,700
you build a road between new york and

111
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,400
boston polygamy between 20 cities merely

112
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,110
to find out that 10 of those cities

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,280
never have any traffic exiting neither

114
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,060
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those are efficient use of resources</font>

115
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,359
they they both cost money and to some

116
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,460
extent building the optical network and

117
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,960
building the routed network<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you</font>

121
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,990
switches draw their spanning trees

122
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,729
across accessible switches and the

there's no light then there's no

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,320
adjacency of course new paths can exist

126
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,300
you can light up a new wave length you

127
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">can connect it to your routers and lo</font>

128
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,110
and behold the routers are going to

129
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,359
create new adjacencies and update their

130
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,860
routing tables but that's not something

131
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,270
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routers did it's something</font>

132

of the universe in terms of how we deal

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,510
even envision a situation where

152
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,090
application libraries you know Python

153
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:57,000
libraries or<font color="#CCCCCC"> C libraries actually have</font>

154
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,530
primitives that let you create an

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,840
ethernet service within some

infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like like you you</font>

157
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,409
can do with AWS to create a variety of

158
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,380
resources and basically say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need I</font>

159
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,450

164
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,070
goes forward that's that's a way that

165
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,320
people will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using III III net</font>

166
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:33,990
services if the infrastructure would

167
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:36,409
would support that but to get there we

168
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:39,030
really have to turn everything we know

169
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,160
upside down we can't assume that

170
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,530
services are going to go where the

171
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,210
bandwidth is just like we can't build a

172

road blindly and assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">where the exits are supposed to be we</font>

174
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,190
need to figure out ways of putting the

175
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,960
bandwidth where the services are so that

176
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,570
requires a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different kind of</font>

177
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,510
thinking so imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the connections</font>

178
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,550
didn't exist a priori what if if you

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,980
started the network as a blank<font color="#CCCCCC"> State you</font>

180
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,800
had your your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Odom's and your packet</font>

181

switches and you wired them up but you

182
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,240
didn't really light any wavelengths up

183
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,390
except maybe some supervisory channels

184
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,100
for for letting the rodents talk to each

with each other to determine who's out

didn't actually light any data channels

190
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:34,500
and then the packet switches and the

191
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:37,409
optical switches could work together to

192
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,500
figure out where to create paths as

193
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,450
needed as services are created then we

194
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,219
can configure the network dynamically we

195
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,020
could figure out where the bandwidth was

196
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,620
needed we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the bandwidth where</font>

197
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,810
it was needed and

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,260
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't we wouldn't have to meet</font>

it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sock'em this is a presentation</font>

205
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sock'em and this is basically an</font>

206
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:16,300
idea for network control system that

207
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,589
uses external control entities to

208
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,380
simultaneously and dynamically allocate

209
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:24,440
both optical transport paths and dynamic

210
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:31,430
Transport has<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad service initiation for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for dynamic ethernet service we press</font>

212
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,800
the button so basically the way it works

213
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,020
is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> request for an</font>

214
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,529
ethernet service now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that request could</font>

215
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:46,480
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does today come from a management</font>

216
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:49,400
entity you know as a network management

217

system or some other management<font color="#E5E5E5"> entity</font>

218
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,270
or as I noted earlier it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could come from</font>

219
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,520
applications and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably falls</font>

220
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,490
into the category of what people are

221
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,939
often calling today application-aware

222
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:07,940
networking so a request comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in for</font>

223
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,980
service and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sock'em infrastructure</font>

224
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,370
will basically look at that request it

225
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,940
will allocate an optical path and that

226
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,980
optical path could be a an existing

227
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,930
optical path it could be a new

228
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,630
point-to-point path between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

229
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,900
endpoints or it could be a concatenation

230
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:29,480
of existing and new optical paths that

231
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,660
are packet switched at intermediate

points<font color="#E5E5E5"> a priori it's it there's there's</font>

233
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,150
no right answer there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decision</font>

234
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,209
is based on on a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of parameters</font>

235
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> states so there's what are the</font>

236
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:46,250
existing ports and the existing

237
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">wavelengths for that are already</font>

238
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:52,970
allocated in the network what are the

239
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,130
current instantiated pads what

240
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,260
wavelengths are lit up and we're where

241
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,209
are they going what are the bandwidth

242
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,430
requirements of the new service that

243
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:01,969
that's a big one you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously if I</font>

244
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,489
have a wave

245
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,639
between point A and B that's a 10g

246
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,670
wavelength and I've got a 4G service on

247
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,410
that wavelength I can't add another HD

248
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,779
service to that wavelength so that's

249
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:18,410
that's an important<font color="#E5E5E5"> point quality of</font>

250
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,720
service if this is a low latency service

251
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,480
then I'm more likely to want to have a

252
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,269
small number of hops or packet hops

253
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,209
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero pathan hops between them and</font>

if it's a best-effort service<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might be</font>

255
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:34,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">willing to just so go from hop to have</font>

256
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,870
to hop what are the protection

257
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:38,269
requirements because you may or may not

258
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,639
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up a protection path the</font>

259
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:42,589
protection path may may need to be

260
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,269
diverse it may not need to be diverse it

261
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,699
mainly the same bandwidth requirements

262
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,560
or the same qos requirements so that's

263
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:51,649
all part of the decision and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can envision that there are a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we're thinking about and</font>

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:11,689
and and doing some prototyping on so let

272
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,269
me walk through through an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example so</font>

first of all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning there are</font>

274
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:19,459
no services and paths there's your

00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,980
optical network which in this pictures

276
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,979
is shown by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the road ohms there are your</font>

279
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,160
side and there are user interfaces on

the outside now one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

281
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,569
differentiates this right off of that

282
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:43,370
from the way people do things today is

283
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:47,420
that that today people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to populate</font>

284
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:49,819
their network ports with with

285
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,740
transceivers as they decide to light

286
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:54,319
them so you usually don't buy a router

287
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,759
and by transceivers for all of the

288
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:58,128
network ports and hook all of those

289
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:01,610
network ports into your optical

290
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:04,699
infrastructure and anticipation of using

291
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:08,209
them in in this network you would be

292

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,689
but maybe a half a dozen ports on each

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,009

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">when the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first service is defined so</font>

from the top left to the top right

303
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:34,920

304
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:37,319
the system will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need a path</font>

305
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,559

309
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:50,699
there's a rules database that goes along

310
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:53,459
with this that defines rules for many

311
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:56,670
many things including what order to

312
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:59,609
allocate wavelengths on so maybe the

313
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,069
rule is that that you you allocate blue

314
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,410
first and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you allocate red as an</font>

315

example so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to allocate I'm</font>

316

318
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:11,970
Rotom and then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to program the</font>

319
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:16,319
packet switch to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this service</font>

320
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:19,319
has a uni on port of Port<font color="#CCCCCC"> one it should</font>

00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:23,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">be forwarded to two and an i won I</font>

322
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:27,689
should tune the transceiver on port 12

323
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,730
blue and tunable transceivers are common

324
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:32,160
today and that's part of the requirement

325
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,959
and then similarly on be I do the same

326
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defined that there's there's a</font>

328
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,309
that is on port<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 and now i have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

329
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,579
ethernet service and i'm using exactly

330
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">as many wavelengths and and exactly as</font>

331
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:53,550
many hops as i need to support that

332
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:57,899
service so what happens next if i add a

333
00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:00,748
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> months services so I'm going</font>

334
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:05,999
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add another service between the top</font>

335
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:09,059
two routers s2 and the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font>

336
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:11,249
to note that i already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a wavelength</font>

337
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:14,009
between between those routers the blue

338
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,990
on the two services will fit on that

339
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:18,449
wavelength so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

340
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,569
another wavelength so we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

341
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:25,309
program the packet switch to forward

342
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:27,189
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unies to that that network port</font>

343
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:29,530
on

344
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,750
both of the packet switches and now s1

345
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,610
and s2 are both traveling over that blue

346
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:39,370
wavelengths between between the two

347
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:42,240
packet switches<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will note again sort</font>

348
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,670
of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of being agnostic that</font>

349
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not proposing any given language for</font>

350
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,360
programming these packet switches you

351
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,359
know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of open flow</font>

352
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,690
going around and this could be open<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

353
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,840
that that's being used here again it's

354
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:05,280
not really relevant to the goal of the

355
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:07,870
solution so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one more service</font>

356
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,199
ss3 and that's between the upper left

357
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,150
switch and the lower right switch well

358
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,920
clearly we need another optical path

359
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:20,530
because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optical path</font>

360
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:23,370
today between those two switches so we

361
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:25,810
have a choice we could either

362
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,250
concatenate two optical paths so we

363
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,810
could go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> A to B and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then B to D and</font>

364
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">packet switch across that path that's a</font>

365
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,560
pretty common way to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

366
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,750
there's enough bandwidth on to you might

367
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,969
want to do it that way or because these

368
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,970
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rotom networks we could simply</font>

369
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,990
create a wavelength directly from A to D

370
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:48,610
and if the parameters of the service

371
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,410
were such that that was a reasonable

372
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so for example if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

373
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,150
required a lot of bandwidth you know if

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,740
this was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight gigabit service you</font>

375
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,199
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to write its own wave</font>

376
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,420
length<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway or if it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a low latency</font>

377
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,790
service you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably wanted to have the</font>

378
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,379
fewest possible hops so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there</font>

379
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a lot of reasons why you might</font>

380
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,520
choose a concatenated path versus a

381
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,560
direct path but in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm showing</font>

382
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,670
a direct path so now we're going to

383
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:19,569
light up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the red wavelengths we're</font>

384
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to drop it at packets which a and</font>

385
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:23,949
we're going to drop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at packets which</font>

386
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,120
d we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at packets</font>

387
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,670
which be we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to route it</font>

388
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,510
optically at packets which<font color="#CCCCCC"> B and now we</font>

389
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:35,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a service from A to D that's direct</font>

390
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:37,660
and can service s3 and again all three

391
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,290
of these services now are

392
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:44,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">our by some definition optically routed</font>

393
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:48,600
in terms of use<font color="#CCCCCC"> of resources and and the</font>

394
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,600
requirements of the service themselves

395
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:56,320
so looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the practical</font>

396
00:17:52,810 --> 00:18:00,129
issues and and and where this really can

397
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,480
provide assistance this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

398
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,070
customers networks this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

399
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,430
pretty prototypical network there are

400
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,050
probably a million networks out there

401
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,570
but we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer that's replicated</font>

402
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,790
and infrastructure sort of like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

403
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:17,350
a bunch of cities so they have a main

404
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:21,700
ring that is covering a metro usually

405
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:23,740
has six or eight nodes on that main ring

406
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,670
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> off each of those nodes they</font>

407
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,190
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution and access rings and</font>

408
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:33,100
that main ring I think in their biggest

409
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Metro today has for 10g wavelengths on</font>

410
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,469
it some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the smaller ones are our two</font>

411
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,690
and then most of the distribution rings

412
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,270
are single 10g although I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

413
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,490
might be a few now that are 210g but

414
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,490
effectively what they've done optical

415
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:52,090
networks tend to be deployed most easily

416
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:55,750
in ring architectures for a number of

417
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:58,270
reasons and what's happened is because

418
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,640
the optical architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> is deployed as</font>

419
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,300
a ring we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy the packet</font>

420
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,370
architecture is already which means that

421
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,649
effectively most of the traffic goes

422
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,389
from hop to hop to hop to hop around the

423
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:15,610
ring and this is really a waste of

424
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:18,010
resources and and it doesn't optimally

425
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,110
route many services that that really

426
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,480
want better service than that the

427
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,070
problem is it's hard I mean the nice

428
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rotom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zyzz it lets you take</font>

429
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,770
an optical ring in turn it into a packet

430
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:32,500
mesh but to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a case-by-case</font>

431
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,170
basis is really complicated as the

432
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,330
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of services go up but even what</font>

433
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens if if you have a service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

434
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,470
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go from there to there and it's</font>

435
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,170
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine gig service well you know it's</font>

436
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:47,140

it goes through and today<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with</font>

441
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,900
that on a case-by-case basis well you

00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,610
know this customers buying an eight gig

443
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,320

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it but in my world in the vision</font>

455
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:32,370
won't work and and and you need a better

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:39,720
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it and that's what what what</font>

457
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:41,610
this is all about and the other the

<font color="#CCCCCC">other capability that comes along is</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been calling</font>

460
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,540
wavelength defragmenting you know if you

461
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,470
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a second let's say</font>

462
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:54,330
you're creating 3 4g services now

463
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to need two</font>

464
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,580
wavelengths for that to carry all three

465
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,610
of those but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens now if you</font>

466
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,460
delete one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4G services in</font>

467
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,500
reality you end up with an extra unused

468
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,290
wavelength now it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

469
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,700
remaining services are already on one

470
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,730
wavelength in which case you could just

471
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,200
eliminate the first the second one or it

472
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,310
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the two remaining 4G</font>

473
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,040
services are on two different

474
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,350
wavelengths but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you can migrate</font>

475
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:26,430
one of those services to the other

476
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:28,010
wavelengths you can reclaim the unused

477
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">wavelength you know just like</font>

478
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:35,940
defragmenting your<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk this basically</font>

479
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:39,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an important aspect because what it</font>

480
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,810
does is it frees up wavelengths and nni

481
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:45,180
ports for more services so a big piece

482
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,340
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to do this dynamically is</font>

483
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,550
the ability to optimize the resources

484
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,199
there's also a power savings because you

485
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:55,590
actually don't end up having to light

486
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,840
the transceivers that that you're not

487
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">using so you effectively can turn on and</font>

488
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn off your network ports as you need</font>

489
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:08,700
them to support services that are being

490
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:11,790
or eliminated so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the components</font>

491
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,670
of of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution like this well as I</font>

492
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:20,520
noted the most important component is

493
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:24,720
the CDC<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rotem the ability for a packet</font>

494
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:27,000
switch to turn on a transceiver to tune

495
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,120
it to a particular color and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

496
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,740
have the network program the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rotom to</font>

497
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,500
route that port to a particular degree

498
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:39,930
dynamically with with with no contention

499
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,570
on other colors is an important part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

500
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:45,870
the solution you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get these today</font>

501
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:48,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not real cost</font>

502
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:52,040
practical to deploy broadly today but

503
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,660
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening they effectively need</font>

506
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,190
direct direct reports you need a packet

507
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,420
switching infrastructure and as I said

508
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,820
right now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is completely agnostic</font>

509
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,010
these can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs they could be pseudo</font>

510
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,590
wires it doesn't really matter how those

tunable transceivers in the packet

513
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,280
switches those are there today we ship

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,790
lots of tunable transceivers in the

515

packet switches they are not real

00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:28,200
honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're primarily used as ways</font>

of eliminating large inventories<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

really exploiting the power of what you

00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,630
could do with with tunable transceivers

526
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,520
and then you need an external control

527
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,110
infrastructure and this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

531
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,810
envisioning a system that looks sort of

532
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,850
like this at least from a prototype

533
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,730
point of view so there's there's the

534
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,889
controller and the controller basically

535
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:09,240
knows how to create optical paths and

536
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:11,580
how to create the the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> pads there</font>

537
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,460
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Annie's at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom which are</font>

538
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:17,090
the three things that have an optical

539
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,340
and and the packet component there are a

540
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,529
few databases that that drive it there's

541
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,709
a rules database and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then of course a</font>

542
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">database of services and then there are</font>

543
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,779
people on the right side that are

544
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,100
creating and destroying those services

545
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:35,149
applications and management

546
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:38,510
infrastructure and these pieces conspire

547
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:40,908
together to to create the the dynamic

548
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:45,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">packet-optical infrastructure which is</font>

549
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:47,360
sort of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal important three-letter</font>

550
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:49,760
words now you can all write checks

551
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:57,559
because everything has to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sdn on it</font>

552
00:24:49,760 --> 00:25:01,940
but realistically the the power of SDN

553
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:06,470
in my mind is that is not that it lets

554
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:12,559
you do existing things cheaper or better

555
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:16,100
or in a in a vendor independent way but

556
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:20,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it enables you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do things that</font>

557
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,459
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible to do without it or it</font>

558
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:25,820
facilitates doing things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just</font>

559
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:28,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to do without it doing the kinds of</font>

560
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:32,980
things that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about with with</font>

561
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sock'em are really hard to do with</font>

562
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:39,919
combined data and control plane in the

563
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:41,210
any because it really requires an entity

564
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look at the packet</font>

565
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,110
infrastructure and the optical

566
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:48,620
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> from above and coordinate</font>

567
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:51,678
them together I leave that that the

568
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,899
power of SDN is to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems like</font>

569
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that not just to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of do the same</font>

571
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:59,750
I'm excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the advent of SDN</font>

572
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:03,158
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it will allow us to</font>

solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems that we can't solve today</font>
