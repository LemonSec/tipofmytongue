2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,780
some quick quick reminders of course

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,060
I'll wrench in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the survey we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,009
have gotten a record number of responses

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,659
we gave out an ipad mini yesterday will

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,180
give out one today as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to</font>

thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terremark for the social last</font>

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:36,629
night those of you who attended I heard

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:39,090
great things and I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> invite Lee</font>

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,750
good morning it is very morning isn't it

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,218
<font color="#E5E5E5">I hope everybody's with me because this</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bumpy</font>

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,210
ride I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start with answering</font>

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,870
Dave's question from yesterday afternoon

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,969
he said why do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need ipv6 only you if</font>

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,408
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a service where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety nine</font>

20
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,869
percent of the bits that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm delivering</font>

21
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,030
are delivered over ipv6 and one percent

22
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,670
isn't isn't that good enough all the

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,100
bits are coming over over v6 and my

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,920
answer is I've spent the last year doing

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,289
presentations about how expensive v4 is

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,350
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get and so as long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as there's</font>

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,540
as long as a customer requires ipv4 the

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,009
expense is already made an ISP has

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,460
already incurred the expense to provide

30
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,619
ipv4 so not until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to v6 only are</font>

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">you able to drive that costs out of the</font>

32
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,250
cost of doing business and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,280
get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a little bit more</font>

34
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,900
detail and show why that is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start with this description of</font>

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,140
this vicious cycle you can tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

37
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,130
vicious cycle because they start pointy

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,009
teeth we have a can't we have a problem

39
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">where content and cuz consumer</font>

40
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,229
electronics only support ipv4 and

41
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,450
therefore ISPs have to keep supporting

42
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,950
ipv4 because they have to fight access

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,719
to that content and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those consumer</font>

44
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,189
electronics they keep supporting ipv4

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,619
and the consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> electronics and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

46
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,539

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,000
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing supporting ipv4 so the ISPs</font>

48
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,080
have to keep providing ipv4 and it keeps

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as and so I say to you if you</font>

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">are an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,840
and you're deploying CGN you are

52
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:21,060
contributing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the perpetuation of this</font>

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,189
vicious cycle because as long as you're

54
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,769
incurring costs and spending money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

55
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:29,099
keep doing ipv4 there's no reason for

56
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,299
anybody else to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support ipv6 so how do</font>

57
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,280
we break this cycle there are two ways

58
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially two ways you can either</font>

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,879
break the top cycle or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom cycle</font>

60
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,769
content consumer electronics can decide

61
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,099
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to support ipv4 thank you</font>

62
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much for to Netflix and the content</font>

63
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for TV six so content of</font>

64
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,670
consumer electronics<font color="#CCCCCC"> and support v6 and</font>

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,179
then ISPs can start start doing v6 only

66
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,129
or ISPs can stop supporting ipv4 that

67
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,780
will provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very strong incentive for</font>

68
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,858
content consider electronics to support

69
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,919
ipv6 that's a pretty bold Avenue to go

70
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:06,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">so let's talk about whether that's even</font>

71
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:08,700
conceivable it could happen I goblet I

72
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,879
call this presentation a game theory of

73
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,560
ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 transition right so there's a</font>

74
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,760
game going on here the name of the game

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,959
is when do i add ipv6 everybody has

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,340
their own strategy to this game

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,699
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> has their own set of</font>

78
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,750
assumptions their own starting positions

79
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,409
but the object<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the game is to</font>

80
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,629
maximize profit and minimize<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

81
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:31,918
probably most companies are in that kind

82
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,328
of business where they're playing that

83
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,569
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> game you're going to maximize</font>

84
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:40,199
profit minimize<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost for isps I've kind</font>

85
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:43,198
of already said CGN costs money go back

86
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,609
to nano 56 and I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TCO of CGN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CGN</font>

87
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,829
costs more money than you think it does

88
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,139
because of the risks involved buying

89
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,000
addresses costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> money mmm address is</font>

90
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,280
currently traded we've seen lots of

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,900
numbers from ten to twelve dollars per

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,239
address in the market that's before the

93
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">rer is even run out that's for all the</font>

94
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:04,769
rars run out I've heard numbers as high

95
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,638
as 16 as low as much less than 10 so we

96
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,560
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what those numbers</font>

97
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,329
are but everybody would agree that the

98
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,229
price is likely to<font color="#CCCCCC"> increase over time so</font>

99
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:15,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost is is to support beast v4 is</font>

100
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,669
going to continue climbing now for

101
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,370
content providers the way for them to

102
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:23,820
minimize cost is to delay supporting

103
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,460
ipv6 for as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible until they</font>

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,570
start losing eyeballs I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Tory Anderson's a v6 only data center</font>

things or<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns cdns and cloud services</font>

are often major consumers by<font color="#CCCCCC"> PV for</font>

115
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,860
right now that's where a lot of growth

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,740
is so those may be places where if you

117
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,199
are a CDN or cloud service you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

118
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,360
to start doing a lot of ipv6 instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

119

delay as long as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> but again</font>

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,120
your your resources as long as possible

145
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so how do you figure that out</font>

146
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,009
well here's a decision tree and this is

147
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:11,400
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of standard game theory kind of</font>

148
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:13,530
perspective so if ISPs say we're going

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,109
to have ipv6 only services at some point

150
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,489
in the future you have to you as a

151
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,080
content provider or you as a consumer

152
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">electronics manufacturer have</font>

153
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,370
essentially two possible responses you

154
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,409
can either support ipv6 or not support

155
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,080
ipv6 those are pretty simple

156
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:31,259
straightforward choices in response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

157
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,500
which is PS then decide can then either

158
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,779
do ipv6 only for some customers they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

159
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,760
do CGN for some customers they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

160
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,560
addresses for some customers they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

161
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,700
any mix of all three of those and it

162
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,380
turns out there

163
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,479
options in it you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

164
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,340
turn-based game their options try to be

165
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,490
the same regardless of whether you do

166
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,820
v6r don't do v6 now how do you decide

167
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:56,430
which one to do what you do is you say

168
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all six permutations there I</font>

169
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,740
PVC you do v6 you don't do v6 and all

170
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,270
the ISP options you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does</font>

171
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,960
that cost me and what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cost the</font>

172
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,539
ISP now you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ISP is going</font>

173
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,880
to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is cheapest and was</font>

174
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,220
profitable for them so then you figure

175
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,170
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether you do v6 what's cheapest</font>

176
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,970
for them whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't do v6 what's</font>

177
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,010
cheapest for them you figure out what's

178
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,840
cheapest for you and work your way back

179
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,640
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior that</font>

180
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,770
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in order to get the ISP to</font>

181
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that behavior and it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a chess</font>

182
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,710
game you can predict what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

183
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,409
opponent's going to do and so you push

184
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,270
them into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> position of making the</font>

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,160
move that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want them to take that's</font>

186
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,409
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of confusing but that's the</font>

187
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,970
simplest version of game theory that

188
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,860
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to figure out how to</font>

189
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,390
summarize so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

190
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,100
simplify that a little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

191
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,990
it very practical how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we figure out</font>

192
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,740
all of that here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game we're going</font>

193
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:53,220
to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs will offer an ipv6 only</font>

194
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,940
surface when the cost of ipv4 is greater

195
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:01,160
than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk of not doing ipv4 in other</font>

196
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:05,160
words here's the premise when it's

197
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,860
riskier to do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peavey's to do ipv4 it's</font>

198
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,740
costlier to do ipv4 then it is risky to

199
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,270
have ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> only then the cost outweighs</font>

200
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,790
the risk and that's when you start to

201
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,729
see ipv6 only so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure that</font>

202
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,280
out well so we need to calculate what

203
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,330
are the costs of doing ipv4 and what are

204
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,090
the caught what are the risks of

205
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,530
supporting ipv6 only so the in this one

206
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,989
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest is presentation</font>

207
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,669
trying to get to put together some

208
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,110
assumptions here and plug them into a

209
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,180
spreadsheet i'll give the URL so you can

210
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,669
download<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and do your own numbers so</font>

211
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,140
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what ipv4 costs you need</font>

212
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,520
to know the price<font color="#CCCCCC"> of addresses you need</font>

213
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,650
to know the cost of whatever your

214
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,090
transition technology might be and the

215
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,340
cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of running dual stacks you can</font>

216
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,730
compare all those things by the way at

217
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">nano 57 the last one I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

218

costs of the the total cost of the the

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,310
transition but I didn't come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

220
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,390
actual dollar amounts i refine that a

221
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,939
little bit and

222
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,650
Denver I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a cost of running</font>

223
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,480
dual stack is about four dollars per

224
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,850
user for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ISP about four dollars per</font>

225
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,020
user more than running single stack so

226
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,480
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost you're trying to run</font>

227
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,880
drive back out that's four dollars per

228
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,920
user per year more<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run dual</font>

229
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,630
stack than single stack and then the

230
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,189
risks are what if there's no content or

231
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,930
what there is insufficient content how

232
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,340
do you quantify that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what if the</font>

233
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">device is like to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six support that's</font>

234
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,870
where we're going you with me so far I

235
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,990
know it's really early in the morning

236
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,780
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and I'm sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of throwing</font>

237
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,910
some some pretty abstract concepts so

238
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,310
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to to again keep</font>

239
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,439
reducing this down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more and more</font>

240
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,699
practical as far as I can go so let's

241
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,460
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a chart that you've kind of</font>

242
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,010
seen before this is total rir

243
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,200
allocations over time you've probably

244
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,270
seen this one before in an errand or

245
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,070
your favorite are our report where the

246
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">NRO statistics come up and they show a</font>

247
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,680
bar chart of all five rirs how much

248
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,410
address space how many / 8 equivalents

249
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,209
they've allocated year by year I've just

250
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken those five bars and stacked them</font>

251
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,190
and then made that a line chart so that

252
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,319
I could then show what the demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

253
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,020
ipv4 has been over time and you can see

254
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,460
here then I did a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of curves to</font>

255
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,900
see what the best fit was to extrapolate

256
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,340
and it turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a very linear</font>

257
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:17,370
curve so it's a linear extrapolation and

258
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:21,240
in two thousand was at 2010 it was about

259
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:24,030
15 / 8 equivalents<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2011 was about 14</font>

260
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,420
/ 8 equivalents but a linear growth over

261
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:30,329
time now I stopped in 2011 because in

262
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,910
2012 ripe and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap Nick weren't allocating</font>

263
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,760
anymore ipv4 addresses well it stands to

264
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,770
reason that when to the five rirs aren't

265
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,480
allocating ipv4 addresses fewer ipv4

266
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,750
addresses are being allocated right so

267
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,370
so that's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a valid data set to</font>

268
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,440
include in this extrapolation the demand

269
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,480
i think is still there it's just not

270
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,830
showing up in the RR allocations if you

271
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,310
really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little X</font>

272
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,540
at about the five<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half six / 8</font>

273
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:59,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">equivalents that's what was actually</font>

274
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:02,670
allocated by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NRO members in in 2012</font>

275
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,070
so I took this and then I flipped it to

276
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,209
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right how can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we extrapolate</font>

277
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,800
what demands going to look like over

278
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">time this is</font>

279
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,120
how can we predict the price of

280
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,180
addresses this is a really thorny thing

281
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,070
to do this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really risky and I need to</font>

282
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,269
warn<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm not very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

283
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:24,540
predicting the future so I did a study

284
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:27,690
of a drug views and I said how many

285
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:31,469
addresses have been allocated but don't

286
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,839
show up in in the BGP tables and how

287
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">many and then I did some some analysis</font>

288
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,040
of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much address space has been</font>

289
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">allocated but isn't fully utilized and I</font>

290
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,199
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are about a billion</font>

291
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,000
ipv4 addresses available to a market

292
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,519
about a billion sounds like a lot it's

293
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,529
not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much as it sounds like so what I</font>

294
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,370
show here is take that billion addresses

295
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:56,189
add in what the remaining rirs have in

296
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:01,680
terms of their free pool and you get to

297
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 1.15 million addresses or sorry to</font>

298
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">get 1.15 billion addresses now if you</font>

299
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">take that linear demand that i showed in</font>

300
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,160
the previous slide and you extrapolate

301
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,600
it and so if demand keeps growing at the

302
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate it has been for the last 14 years</font>

303
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">linear extrapolation then the entire</font>

304
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:21,060
market would run out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of addresses by the</font>

305
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:23,550
end of 2015 so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

306
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,199
market is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to save us we're already</font>

307
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of AD we've got two years before</font>

308
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,270
route of addresses this is not a supply

309
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">curve this isn't even a demand curve if</font>

310
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,140
this were if there's a real curve then

311
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">there'd be prices along the bottom and</font>

312
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,470
you could see how demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> would change</font>

313
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,060
over time based on price that's not what

314
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,570
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is a simple extrapolation</font>

315
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,609
of if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> kept consuming ipv4 addresses</font>

316
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,899
at the rate we have been now if you say

317
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,670
it's not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep growing at that</font>

318
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,079
rate we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these six demand is going</font>

319
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,120
to be suppressed a little bit it's going

320
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">to stay flat rather than keep growing</font>

321
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,579
that's the red line we're still<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

322
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,980
addresses by 2017 only if you go to that

323
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:01,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">last line if you think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 / 8</font>

324
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">equivalence assigned in 2012 was is</font>

325
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,699
what's going to keeping is the

326
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,040
continuing demand then that gets you out

327
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:10,290
to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 20 27 right that's</font>

328
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,969
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not realistic though it's</font>

329
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably much sooner than all of that</font>

330
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,670
now this is I've also gone in and drawn

331
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:20,640
some black lines where the address is

332
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,360
available change so above that top black

333
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,620
line is

334
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,110
is you can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> get addresses from an r</font>

335
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">ir it may not be right for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ATP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick but</font>

336
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,350
you could theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow get</font>

337
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:32,069
addresses from an Aaron lack<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick or</font>

338
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:34,200
after Nick once the rirs are completely

339
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:37,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of address space the only way to get</font>

340
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,910
addresses is to buy them so I believe

341
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">there would be a price</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inflection point</font>

342
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">their price for addresses will get more</font>

343
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:45,209
expensive at that point seems reasonable

344
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know exactly how much but right</font>

345
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:50,010
around there one would expect the prices

346
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:52,920
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase again now this first this</font>

347
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,700
next tier of addresses though is these

348
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,870
are I dresses that aren't currently

349
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">routed on the internet people aren't</font>

350
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,029
using these on the internet at all right

351
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,560
now so those are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to make</font>

352
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:03,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">available to the to a market so they're</font>

353
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,219
not too terribly expensive compared to

354
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,350
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are now maybe even starting at</font>

355
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,630
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prices that we're seeing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

356
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,640
the next black line is addresses that

357
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,730
are routed and are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used but aren't</font>

358
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,319
necessarily being used efficiently so

359
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we start where it starts</font>

360
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,500
to get real interesting so in order to

361
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,570
make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> net that last set of addresses</font>

362
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,370
available somebody has to go renumber<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

363
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,430
would take their their address block

364
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,019
renumber all their hosts into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fraction</font>

365
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,790
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that address block and make the rest</font>

366
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,279
of the address block available it's more

367
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,569
expensive it's riskier the cost of

368
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,829
remembering is probably one two three

369
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,589
dollars per host or the estimates that

370
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:38,819
I've heard so the price is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

371
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit higher for those addresses so</font>

372
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,019
i expect another inflection point at

373
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:46,199
about 500 million addresses why do i do

374
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:48,209
all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was one</font>

375
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,819
more chart that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show and john</font>

376
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:52,859
curran mentioned this yesterday there's

377
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,370
been increased demand at<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron over the</font>

378
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,800
past few months significantly increased

379
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,199
compared to previous years so I was

380
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,329
talking to Tony<font color="#CCCCCC"> Haines and we said let's</font>

381
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,250
take instead of taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last 10 years</font>

382
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:08,310
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history and trying to do the best fit</font>

383
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,350
curve let's provide let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

384
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,969
last three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months is more predictive of</font>

385
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,279
the next three months than the entire

386
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,610
last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so by doing a heavier</font>

387
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,610
weighting of the past few months your

388
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,290
curve changes so he's got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high</font>

389
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,570
exponential polynomial<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ends up</font>

390
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,250
saying something like he's updated a

391
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,399
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times since i took this snapshot</font>

392
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,399
but it's sometime in<font color="#CCCCCC"> october</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this year's</font>

393
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,529
when aaron runs out now that's pretty

394
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,279
bold right that's that and he's overlaid

395
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,370
here the

396
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,899
that the red line is the AP Nick run out

397
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,089
so you can see their curve changed

398
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,480
dramatically over the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

399
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:47,310
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to me</font>

400
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this is when you look at Jeff</font>

401
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,719
Houston's run out projections he's

402
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:55,139
projecting when Aaron hits their last /

403
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,899
8 now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron doesn't have a last / 8</font>

404
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,730
policy they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to the end and keep</font>

405
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,430
allocating until they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got no more</font>

406
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,499
address space to allocate this

407
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:07,349
projection shows when Aaron would get

408
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:09,749
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to its last / 24 assuming all</font>

409
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,550
addresses get handed out equally so this

410
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:14,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a very frightening kind of number two</font>

411
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:17,790
me and shows potentially when that first

412
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,069
inflection point might hit so based on

413
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,139
all that let's pick some numbers out of

414
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:24,029
the air for what prices might look like

415
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,319
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few years now remember</font>

416
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,329
what I'm trying to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

417
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,610
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the cost of ipv4 so I can</font>

418
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:31,138
compare it to the risk of not doing ipv4

419
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,819
so I can figure out when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

420
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:36,149
costly when it's too expensive to

421
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:37,889
provide ipv4 all so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick</font>

422
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,569
some random numbers that's not random

423
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some numbers and say</font>

424
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:45,120
that next year addresses will be sixteen

425
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,769

426
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,389
probably not I don't know what's going

432

numbers that seem reasonable to me over

433
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,180
time and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think they're a couple</font>

434
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,699
of inflection points where the prices do

435
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,589
jump up a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've also included</font>

436
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,929
this table the cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier grade net</font>

437
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,599
based on the tcf CGN that i did last

438
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,520
year but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> including the risk here</font>

439
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,408
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come back and model</font>

440
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,299
the risk again separately so the base

441
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:21,089
cost of CGN is about six dollars per

442
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,199
user plus a fraction of the cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:31,530
nice round numbers you can disagree with

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope you do because there's these</font>

448
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,039

fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm particularly future if I were</font>

retired based on stock market

452
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,429
predictions right so I'm not a genius

453
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,649
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I'm picking some numbers</font>

454
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,120
based on some reasonable to me sets of

455
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:46,469
assumptions you get to make your own

456
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,379
assumptions you get to plug in your own

457
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,480
numbers and do an analysis I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

458
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,590
try to provide a way to be thinking

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about these things</font>

460
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so there's the cost let's talk</font>

461
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,080
about the risk now this it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

462
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,990
how do you model risk and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

463
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,169
quantify risk and how risky is it to do

464
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:09,290
ipv6 only for a given internet

465
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,120
subscriber if the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumer</font>

466
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,580
or whatever the consumers want to do

467
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,469
doesn't work over v6 then they might

468
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,139
cancel that's your fundamental risk now

469
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,260
that could be content like a website or

470
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,510
it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an application it could be a</font>

472
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">support v6 for instance that might be</font>

473
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,610
important and there's some risk that if

474
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,750
that application or that content doesn't

475
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,429
work there's some risk that your

476
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,540
customer might cancel that's expensive

477
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,120
that's you know you're trying to

478
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,790
maximize profit minimize<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and you're</font>

losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you incur that risk but not</font>

481
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,230
do you figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how important a given</font>

482
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,750
website or given set of content is the

interesting analysis where they said

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,490
well let's we can sort of stack how

00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,360
tracks actually fairly closely with the

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,070
for any given quad a query what's the

all right what if we've got so how much

these companies to not only support ipv6

but to say out loud that you're about to

531
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,090
add ipv6 support or at least say to me

532

quietly that you about to add ipv6 so I

533

can stop shaming you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> public we're</font>

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,520
trolling like I did yesterday okay where

my personal website does not yet support

ipv6 because my hosting provider does

their average revenue per user is 400

this the ISPs have 33 tactics they can

choose in this game they can do ipv6

only they can do CGN they can buy a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pv</font>

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,950
for doing ipv6 only is essentially

568
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,900
nothing right once you've got gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual</font>

569
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">stack you can do v6 only without</font>

570
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,980
spending any money actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can argue</font>

571
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost doing ipv6 only is</font>

572
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,980
negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> four dollars you save four</font>

573
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,590
dollars because you no longer having to

574
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,400
support ipv4 however that's not really

575
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,020
true you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

576
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,250
really drive that cost out until you're

577
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,720
able to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for substantially all of</font>

578
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,160
your customers you're still doing all

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network support and updates and</font>

580
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,630
software and everything to support ipv4

581
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:29,780
until you're really pushing ipv6 only

582
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,880
very broadly now the percent at risk for

583
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,889
doing ipv6 only here we're starting to

584
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,930
get a little fuzzy so so present at risk

585
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,110
for doing ipv6 only if sixty-three

586
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,730
percent of content is available or ipv6

587
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,040
then thirty-seven percent of content is

588
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,930
at risk so thirty-seven percent of the

589
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,820
sites that your customers hit our

590
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,640
potential risk sites that that might

591
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,080
cause them to cancel now how likely is

592
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,000
it that they already canceled well I

593
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,040

623
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,719
or thirteen point seven percent of

624
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,580
subscribers who are put behind CGN are

625
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,960
at risk something breaks for them and

626
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,280
let's call it a fifty percent chance

627
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,520
they cancel because they're upset by

628
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,290
that and buying addresses if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

629
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,180
has cost forty dollars and you pass on

630
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,610
one hundred percent to the cost to the

631
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,140
customer then there's some risk that the

632
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,370
increased cost the customer that they

633
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,840
cancel or they don't sign up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

636
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,340
ease and all that much but there's some

637
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,020
risk now you might decide that you don't

638
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,280
want to pass on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent you</font>

639
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,110
might eat some of that erode your

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,970

643

it for your side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business too so</font>

660

here's the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> triple mix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isps can</font>

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,870
a mix of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so in the</font>

ten percent increments for for each of

666
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,750
those mixes then I list the base cost

667
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,510
based on the assumptions in the previous

668
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,340
slide the base cost is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> capital how</font>

669
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,350
much did you actually spend in order to

670
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,020
implement whatever set of solutions we

671
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:34,340
have there then we have impact now

672
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:37,670
impact is the risk times likelihood how

673
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,620
risky is the is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this method</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

674
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,120
strategy you've chosen how much so

675
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,169
there's how likely is it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

676
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,820

677
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,860
that's that's bad and then how likely

678
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,629
are they to cancel and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course I've</font>

679
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,070
added<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost in there because you always</font>

680
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,240
you know you've already lost that money

681
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,080
that's that's built right into your

682
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,310
total impact so cost plus a wrist x

683
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,470
likelihood and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have the worst</font>

685
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,620
if the likelihoods<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred percent</font>

686
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so the likelihood of a customer</font>

687
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,159
can if all affected customers cancel

688
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,240
that's kind of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst-case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario</font>

689
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,730
so what I've ended up here with is you

690
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,310
get to choose which set of criteria

691
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,530
which which set of impact is most

692
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,200
important to you is it how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> capital</font>

693
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,629
you actually spend is the overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact</font>

694
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,610
or how much weight do you need to give

695
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,440
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worst case scenario now the</font>

696
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,669
numbers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I chose I chose fairly</font>

697
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,470
carefully after playing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight</font>

698
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,900
spreadsheet for a little while so that I

699
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,300
could figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay at forty dollars</font>

700
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:36,380
per address at with those 15 sites all

701
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,940
supporting v6c g110 CGN you come up the

702
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,090
base cost of million dollars makes sense

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:43,390
ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars per customer for CGN times a</font>

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,480
then the risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> and likelihood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">cut of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your new customers behind CGN</font>

711
00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:02,390
nifty so then I took a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

712
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:05,689
lines there and G at forty dollars per

713
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:08,090
address you start to see that ipv6 only

714
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,460
has zero capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost because you've</font>

715
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,959
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> done dual stack and actually</font>

716
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,750
most isp's are not spending a whole lot

717
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,520
in capital to play v6 in the first place

718
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,940
zero capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and the lowest impact</font>

719
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,190
of all those options so at that set of

720
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,140
assumptions it starts to make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

721
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,960
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though not all content has migrated</font>

722
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:33,500
to v6 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost-effective thing for</font>

723
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:37,880
an ISP to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to offer ipv6 only I'm</font>

724
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:40,310
going to say that again according to my

725
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,630
set of assumptions when the top 15

726
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:46,820
websites support ipv6 and the price for

727
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:50,660
addresses on the market exceeds forty

728
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:53,120
dollars then ipv6 only makes sense so

729
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,700
now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to do is figure out when</font>

730
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,729
is that set of conditions true I don't

731
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,590
know I can't predict exactly when

732
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,210
addresses will hit forty dollars I do

733
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,000
know somebody who would be delighted to

734
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,440
sell us / 24 for ten thousand dollars if

735
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,990
anybody wants to go in on that that

736
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,800
would get the price up to forty dollars

737
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,800
doesn't seem like the right way to go

738
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,290
what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do is I'd like to say</font>

739
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,040
everybody download the spreadsheet

740
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:21,050
everybody plug in your own set of

741
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,149
assumptions figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what year you</font>

742
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:25,190
think those set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumptions is true</font>

743
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:27,560
and then we let's all get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

744
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what date can we choose</font>

745
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,780
can we choose a date together that we

746
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,270
can all commonly work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for to make v6</font>

747
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:37,250
a viable<font color="#CCCCCC"> alternative to v4 so we can</font>

748
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,950
commonly reduce all of our costs across

749
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,300
the across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so the remaining</font>

750
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,640
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have is is it even possible</font>

751
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:46,730
can we work toward a common ipv6 only

752
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,590
date this is I didn't come here just to

753
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,880
entertain and provide some

754
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,699
thought-provoking questions I actually

755
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,110
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if we can take this home and</font>

756
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,919
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to work on</font>

757
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,600
this together

758
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:57,919
and what do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do how do we go</font>

759
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,840
about picking whatever that data is

760
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,950
what's the next step we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taught</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

761
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,720
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

762
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,970
said there are some interim steps that

763
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,649
have to be taken so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one was</font>

764
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,239
well what happens when you turn off ipv4

765
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:09,768
what does ipv6 only look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

766
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:12,049
presented the first couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of days of</font>

767
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:15,739
research on testing on that yesterday

768
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:17,690
that's what that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the next step a</font>

769
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:20,059
next step might be well let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some</font>

770
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,639
v6 evangelists let's find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people in</font>

771
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:25,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">this room maybe who are really gung-ho</font>

772
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:27,408
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 and have them turn off ipv4</font>

773
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:30,139
at home so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it really</font>

774
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:31,999
looks like to live on ipv4 only I would

775
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:33,199
recommend if it were me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have a</font>

776
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,909
separate segment for the rest of my

777
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">family because they might get mad at me</font>

778
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:40,340
they might not like the ipv6 only

779
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:42,109
experience but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if we get three</font>

780
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,570
people a dozen people a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> dozen</font>

781
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:46,879
people running v6 only suddenly there

782
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,230
are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can go to content</font>

783
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:51,230
providers content providers can hear us

784
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:53,029
say there are indeed actual ipv6 only

785
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:56,090
users in the world what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

786
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:58,899
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them do we need a prep day do we</font>

787
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,039
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to declare a date in 2014 to say</font>

788

content needs to be ready about to be

789
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,470
sort these six only by that date do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

790
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:08,269
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say we as a collective group</font>

791
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,039
maybe pick a date where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

792
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:11,809
to turn off v4 for ourselves which and

793
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and see how it looks maybe just for a</font>

794
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,109
day and report back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

795
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,840
community what our experience was like

796
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:20,330
and here's the one that kills me this is

797
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep coming back to we</font>

798
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,369
all know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find anybody except</font>

799
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,389
some vendors who believes that

800
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:31,488
carrier-grade NAT less than sucks right

801
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:33,229
everybody says we have we're going to do

802
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:34,519
carry a great net and once we do carry

803
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,799
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> now at the experience it can be so</font>

804
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,749
bad that everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else will do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

805
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,820
start supporting ipv6 well if we know

806
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:44,330
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stink do we have to do it</font>

807
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,470
can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just skip that step please some</font>

808
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,689
people have said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what we should do</font>

809
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,009
is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should slow down ipv4 or we should</font>

810
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">have you know not provide enough</font>

811
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:53,929
capacity in our carrier-grade NAT a good

812
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,289
luck with that I don't know how to sell

813
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:59,090
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so I'm very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:00,769
people's answers people's thoughts about

815
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,499
this structure for how to think about

816
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:05,480
how to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 only and answers to the</font>

817
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:07,149
questions that I have up here thank you

818
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:15,320
very much

819
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:18,139
any questions comments thoughts you're

820
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,999
going to limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to three questions ok</font>

821
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:24,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll go quickly gave my nice talk thank</font>

822
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:27,379
you um I was wondering in your modeling

823
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:29,090
how much you've waited or or if you bro

824
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:31,039
if you've looked inside the eggs<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest</font>

825
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,749
factors that fit inside likes a risk

826
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,850
like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I'll just give one for</font>

827
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:37,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">example though you're talking about the</font>

828
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:40,879
price of ipv4 addresses going up at what

829
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:43,519
point does it become an asset I mean and

830
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:45,199
in it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if ever and if so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how does that</font>

831
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,179
affect your model so i have not figured

832
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,850
out whether ipv4 addresses should be

833
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:52,639
considered capital or an operating

834
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,019
expense so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know how they get i</font>

835
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,309
don't know how the accounting works I

836
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,450
mean there's a kind of a whole bunch of

837
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:58,460
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just wondering if</font>

838
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,559
inside something like risk you've done

839
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:06,499
any deeper work on that no not really

840
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:08,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I i I'm Masato from softbank can</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that ileal will latch into the</font>

851
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:44,899
market and actually on 2010 like nickel

852
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:47,689
people's still there hosting we have

853
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:50,629
enough in outer space but in last year

854
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:53,359
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed the chain their comment oh</font>

855
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:56,090
you're running out so I'm afraid that

856
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:59,899
same similar thing will happen in a

857
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:02,809
clinic earlier in near future now that's

858
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:06,549
reason why and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sting still blue lines</font>

859
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:09,350
still optimistic that makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

860
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:10,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I actually Phil Rosenthal from is</font>

861
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,590
prime actually wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out there</font>

862
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:16,219
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually another way to look at</font>

863
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:19,220
it that it is perhaps not even this bad

864
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,000
you know when you run to the point that

865
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,580
you can't

866
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,760
in errinel allocation and IP start

867
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:28,010
costing money a lot of companies may

868
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,180
start saying like you know my comcast at

869
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:34,310
home if I you know do a scan on my / 21

870
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm provisioned off of 80 ten</font>

871
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,419
percent of the hosts on any given time

872
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:41,419
will actually even answer arc they're

873
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">not there so maybe the dhcp server it</font>

874
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,770
can be configured to you know instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

give the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP for a week maybe only give</font>

00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:51,350
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for six hours something like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start approaching a run out you</font>

878
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,649
know maybe we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start getting more</font>

879
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,020
efficient with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources that</font>

00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,780
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist there is a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs to</font>

881
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:02,090
going to v6 I mean you know as a web

882
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">hoster we see a lot of software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

883
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:08,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">while it quote unquote supports v6 it's</font>

884
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">not perfect there are still bugs that's</font>

00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,409
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure how much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more efficient</font>

tighter<font color="#E5E5E5"> dude speech at Lisa's would be</font>

887
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:20,110
but I agree that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that they</font>

were likely to see thanks thanks
