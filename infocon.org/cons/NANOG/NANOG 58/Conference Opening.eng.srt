316
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:12,430
obligatory maps for you the first is our

317
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,870
network map and I was actually surprised

318
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:20,469
when even during the interview process

319
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:22,570
that there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually as many former</font>

320
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Terremark data centers and the breadth</font>

321
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,100
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network I'd always thought of</font>

322
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">Terremark as being you know mostly like</font>

323
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:33,610
Al a damn you know centric sort of

324
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,589
company but you know I was really

325
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:40,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">surprised that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was Dallas and</font>

326
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:42,070
Denver and Europe and so we we updated

327
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,670
our network map and we'll be putting

328
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:49,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> online pretty soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our second blue</font>

330
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,890
of discuss the evolution of the verizon

331
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terremark acquisition is our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

332
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">center map so not only do we have all</font>

333
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:04,000
the data centers that are on the network

334
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,950
map but you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Verizon acquired</font>

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">terremark they realize that terremark</font>

336
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:12,370
has expertise in managing data centers

337
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,170
so now all of there's three different

338
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:18,339
classifications of data centers within

339
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,180
the form of verizon world so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

340
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:22,150
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the preemie</font>

him and former<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terremark data centers on</font>

342
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,630
this map and again I was just completely

343
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:33,070
surprised by the breath of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

344
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:36,580
portfolio there so to discuss a little

345
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:40,690
bit more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transfer of ownership</font>

346
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,850
of some of the assets at at aramark I

347
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:46,660
just wanted to kind of go over you know

348
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:50,020
how the evolution is and where we're at

349
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,120
today so originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had terremark</font>

350
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">standalone now is that then it became</font>

351
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">terremark a verizon company now it's</font>

352
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,850
verizon terremark you know what's in the

353
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">future you know probably only our</font>

354
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:05,079
marketing guys know we've had changes in

355
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,940
leadership but they've all remained

356
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,149
within you know the former<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terremark</font>

357
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:14,560
group so for everybody that had concern

358
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:17,830
about you know how the assets would be

359
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,290
managed you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now is</font>

360
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,329
still that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Terremark folks will</font>

361
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,770
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> managing you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Terremark</font>

362
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,730
portfolio it's a part of a much larger

363
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,490
organization at verizon enterprise

364
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,800
services there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end</font>

365
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,570
that's being incorporated right now that

366
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,669
hopefully should<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you know</font>

367
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,970
everything within the company easier

368
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:45,430
last year when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave Newton was up here</font>

369
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,070
he was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the 2013 investment</font>

370
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,600
in our peering platforms and so I just

371
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,360
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to update everybody on what's</font>

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:26,800
of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I started to look into the</font>

388
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:40,630
into the 21st century a little bit we

389
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:43,090
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently have published our stats</font>

390
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,789
but we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty close to 500</font>

391
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,899
gigs and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

392
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:49,960

393
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:51,760
transparent and so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get to the</font>

394
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">point where we can publish this will</font>

395
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,529
start publishing our stats on a regular

396
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,539
basis and aside from that you know

397
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:02,980
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is what kind of business</font>

as usual we're hosting the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> event</font>

399
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,659

400
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:10,629
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be leaving here at</font>

430
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:48,510
I do as well it's a fantastic project

431
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:52,840
you know those of you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

432
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:56,050
ripe is just real quick ripe is kind of

433
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,470
the conglomerate of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are nanog</font>

434
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:02,770
and Aaron put together so they operate

435
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:06,160
the the regional registry for Europe as

436
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:08,139
well as run a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very</font>

437
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,080
similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to nanog and do the same sort of</font>

438
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:17,500
outreach for the region that the that

439
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:19,090
they operate in so those of you who are

440
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,460
familiar with ripe Atlas<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font>

441
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,250
it does those of you who are not we've

442
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,920
seen we saw presentation last nod

443
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,140
regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hurricane sandy from the ripe</font>

444
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,760
Atlas people that used a ton of data and

445
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,870
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> my probe was featured in there</font>

446
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:37,480
used a ton of data about network

447
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,909
availability and the failure modes that

448
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we saw in various networks around the</font>

449
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,840
world because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hurricane sandy and</font>

450
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,910
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of the tip of the</font>

451
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,070
iceberg<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what those probes can do and</font>

452
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:52,750
the kind of information that they can

453
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:54,639
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of an eye</font>

454
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,500
chart of a slide but you know it

455
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,630
measures a lot and they are very

456
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,480
extensible they're adding new test types

457
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,460
all the time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run your</font>

458
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,650
own tests if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> purchase credits to do</font>

459
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,720
that and there's ways of doing that both

460
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:12,760
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> via currency and as well as</font>

461
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">running your own probe so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

462
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,120
mentioned the second one here which is

463
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,610
the effects of Hurricane sandy but you

464
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,010
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how broad the data from these</font>

465
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,669
boxes can be used how broadly and can be

466
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:28,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">used for all sorts of different things</font>

467
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:33,480
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the debugger no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flying it's</font>

468
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:35,350
a tricky word to say of 128 / 16

469
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,740
presented a ton of really interesting

470
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,070
usable data and was<font color="#CCCCCC"> extremely helpful to</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

472

<font color="#E5E5E5">the newer ones are slightly larger than</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the older ones the they are powered by</font>

475
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:55,899
500 milliamps a USB power which is you

476
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,360
know an iphone charger or any other

480
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,009
really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs an outbound path to</font>

the internet you know you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMZ it off</font>

483
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,950
internally not that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a use</font>

484
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:16,928
case for it but you know those who are

485
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:21,429
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> security it really only</font>

needs outbound access to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet if</font>

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:26,409
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one please take one but</font>

488
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:27,639
set it up please don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it in it</font>

489
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:30,370
sitting in a drawer somewhere these

490
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:32,199
things are cheap but they're not free to

491
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:36,100
ripe and so it's kind of a waste if you

492
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,649
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and don't actually use it all</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that said the table where if you'd</font>

495
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:46,299
right outside the door directly across

496
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hallway here there are one or two</font>

497
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,870
representatives there who can answer

498
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,899
questions you can sign you up who can

499
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,879
give you a probe and you know we want to

500
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:58,059
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank comcast for setting that up</font>

501
00:23:54,879 --> 00:24:00,789
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enabled getting ripe out</font>

502
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:04,000
here to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's the first time that</font>

503
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:06,100
we've had these here and I'm really

504
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited to see what that does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

505
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,610
adoption of these probes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

506
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,168
there's already a bunch of deployed but

507
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,600
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their deployment maps of</font>

508
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:15,370
the US vs Europe and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus Asia</font>

509
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,879
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more concentration</font>

510
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:20,289
elsewhere so it would be great to to see

511
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:23,019
them on a lot more networks out here in

512
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:28,919
the US and on that note<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd like to</font>

513
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:28,919
jump into the actual main program Sasha
