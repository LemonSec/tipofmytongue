1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright we're going to get started just</font>

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,120
a reminder we lightning talks emissions

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,700
are still open we've accepted the talks

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,730
for this afternoon but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have</font>

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,289
slots for tomorrow and if you have

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,050
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that you can fit</font>

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,050
into 10 minutes a new idea something

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool something that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people out</font>

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,699
so you'd like input<font color="#CCCCCC"> on whatever that may</font>

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,488
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> lighting talks are a great slot to</font>

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,930
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in so you can submit those you</font>

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,790
can just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the main now at website</font>

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,290
and go to the meeting website and find

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,160
the link from there or you can go

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,780
directly to<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCA org from from your</font>

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,620
browser and submit them through the

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,750
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano program committee tool</font>

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,538
want to thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> the social sponsors from</font>

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:01:01,109
last night BTW i and coresight they did

20
00:00:51,539 --> 00:01:05,309
a fantastic job so thanks guys reminder

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,770
on surveys of course tell us how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

22
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,658
make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> program better for you win an</font>

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,320
ipad mini<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll give away the first</font>

24
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,170
serve a gift from yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe</font>

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,240
before the break and then we'll have

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,090
another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> for today's surveys so</font>

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,280
please again that's the best way to tell

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,159
the program committee how we're doing

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,360
and how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can serve you better again</font>

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,220
those should be linked off of the

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,470
meeting website at not org and for

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,240
opening talk this morning we have a man

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">who I have a ton of respect for Dave</font>

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,780
Meyer who saw this talk once before and

35
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,790
was incredibly confused by it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,070
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then it made an</font>

37
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,640
absolute<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense and so anyone here who</font>

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,070
operates a network and thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,110
to balance complexity against simplicity

40
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,789
should find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of truth in this and</font>

41
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:03,020
so I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking forward to to Dave</font>

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,020
presenting this again thanks Dave

43
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:18,490
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can operate this in hey good</font>

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,250
morning it's great to be here so this

45
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">work is work that's been kind of in my</font>

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">head for the last 15 or so years but I</font>

47
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,700
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> working as many of you know I've</font>

48
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">been working in this doing this</font>

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,160
complexity suffer quite some time

50
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:37,570
working in sort of the systems science

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,850
area systems biology risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> management</font>

52
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,230
stuff it's all kind of related but what

53
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,790
wound up happening was I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started working</font>

54
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this sdn stuff because it kind of</font>

55
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,150
looked interesting a couple years<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

56
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,590
and it sort of came together on two

57
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,350
things kind of came together for me as

58
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,910
one why was this sdn thing happening and

59
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,750
and the second thing was what did it

60
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">really mean in terms of you know the</font>

61
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,210
complexity profile of all of his stuff

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,120
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of what this talks about</font>

63
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,140
its and you know it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

64
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,200
different than maybe what you'd expect

65
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:12,880
at a at a at nanog but let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it</font>

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,070
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I had this idea i was i</font>

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,109
was working at cisco and I had this idea

68
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,609
that there's there's these giant things

69
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,170
that people aren't noticing and so I

70
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,490
just call these things macro trends I'll

71
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,769
just talk about a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them in a</font>

72
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,050
second but and how they led to this sdn

73
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:29,350
thing and then kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tight out into</font>

74
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:31,180
the hole you know complexity and and

75
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,769
some some other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are related</font>

76
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,930
and then then you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

77
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,120
context like why were people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

78
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,730
do sdn in the first place how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,110
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> where is it all going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

80
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,239
what's sdn well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this all about</font>

81
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,850
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it affect us so that's what</font>

82
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to get out with all of this</font>

83
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,519
so let's see yeah so this talk is um

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,320
supposed to you know I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

85
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,800
so funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody ever gets this I</font>

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,739
think it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hold or something but</font>

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,630
uh so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is supposed to be</font>

88
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,040
controversial and provocative and

89
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,850
there's a little bit of science<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I try</font>

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,310
to you know I try to kind of ground this

91
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff because as you guys know the whole</font>

92
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,870
sdn stuff is pretty much hype or most of

93
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">it anyway there's some there's some</font>

94
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,608
reality in it but so what am I trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

95
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:21,829
do here

96
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:23,659
so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poor or at</font>

97
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,710
least get you to think that there are

98
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:29,120
some trans here that we can identify and

99
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,489
basically the effect of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is</font>

100
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,060
volatility and uncertainty which is kind

101
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of bad news maybe but this talk is going</font>

102
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,379
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about why that is</font>

103
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,750
how Sdn and software in general is

104
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,639
causing or accelerating this effect and

105
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,169
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know finally maybe what we</font>

106
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,120
could do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take advantage of it and you</font>

107
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">know by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I always like to send</font>

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,870
these decks to Sean Durran I don't know

109
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,080
anybody know Sean anybody remember Sean

110
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,340
yeah well the sprint guys probably do

111
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,750
anyway so I had this take advantage of

112
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,279
this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

113
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,080
anti fragility stuff which I'll talk

114
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,340
about in a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shonda said you know</font>

115
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,789
forget that let's see if we can just

116
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,878
survive it you know so I you know that

117
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:09,318
<font color="#CCCCCC">was just comment on this okay so here's</font>

118
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,270
another so these macro trends so here's

119
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,919
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I don't know when</font>

120
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,049
I have a slide and I don't have a

121
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,460
graphic<font color="#E5E5E5"> for I generally just type it</font>

122
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,770
into Google Images and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what comes</font>

123
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,438
back and this you know happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you</font>

124
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,758
know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working back</font>

125
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,289
when I said macro<font color="#E5E5E5"> tens this it happens</font>

126
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place called viaje on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Malley</font>

127
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:30,229
but it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice picture and I</font>

128
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:32,349
kind of liked it so I left it so i have

129
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">this slide so here's a macro trend</font>

130
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:37,099
intelligence in everything we do is

131
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,050
evolving at a great rapid rate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

132
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:40,819
showed the slide two people at cisco and

133
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,259
brocade for that matter and you know of

134
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:44,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">course being an equipment hardware</font>

135
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,819
vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this wasn't the</font>

136
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,830
greatest slide to show senior executives

137
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:50,900
because it kind of is saying the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

138
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,909
is all about software when people are in

139
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,400
the business of building hardware they

140
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:57,770
kind of bristle at this a little bit but

141
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,479
the basic the basic thing is if you look

142
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,159
at nature and one of the themes of all

143
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,810
of this is that we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

144
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:04,550
of systems that aren't just the internet

145
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the Internet is just an instance</font>

146
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,779
of a system that we can characterize by

147
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:10,849
various properties and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about</font>

148
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:12,139
that in a second but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if we look</font>

149
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">in nature which is one of the favorite</font>

150
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,430
places to look for complex systems

151
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,949
because it's unbelievably complex what

152
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,560
we see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that over time it basically</font>

153
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">became about code right you won't you</font>

154
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,150
get you know a bunch of course and stuff

155
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,159
everybody has a bunch of course and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

156
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,959
want to start building more

157
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:31,520
sophisticated functionality it's always

158
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,910
software right

159
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,198
so in nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we saw was sort of</font>

160
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,419
reptilian brain you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as stuff that</font>

161
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,849
does your autonomic nervous system stuff

162
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,190
that forwards packets maybe and with

163
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,719
that what what happened was intelligence

164
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,639
evolved what was the intelligence well

165
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,770
it had a good processor but it was

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,599
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about software so there are these</font>

167
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,549
architectural features and I've listed a

168
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,020
few of them here on the left and I'll

169
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,479
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these in more detail as we</font>

170
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,460
get into this but that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify</font>

171
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,229
in all of these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> including the</font>

172
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,508
internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll explain where that is</font>

173
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,159
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

174
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,930
particular those ones in red there which

175
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,940
are ryf complexity which is a

176
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,020
fundamental thing in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems I was</font>

177
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking to somebody about this last</font>

178
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,020
night it's kind of a counterintuitive

179
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,759
thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you some examples</font>

180
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,840
and you'll and you'll be able to see

181
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,180
where this has happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and</font>

182
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,330
bowtie architectures and the other ones

183
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,340
are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know things</font>

184
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we see every day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like very</font>

185
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,258
distributed systems layered systems and

186
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,909
component reduce you know component

187
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:34,310
reuse is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one we're pretty good at like</font>

188
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:37,190
traceroute right there's out-trick trace

189
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:40,370
shots about reuse so here's another

190
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,110
trend um another one that you know my

191
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,080
employers haven't liked over the years

192
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,789
is that you know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you know</font>

193
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,830
how vendors like to sell and<font color="#E5E5E5"> den</font>

194
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:51,349
solutions I think the trend is away from

195
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that d siloing is what I've been calling</font>

196
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:55,550
this sort of basically from vertical to

197
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,029
horizontal horizontal integration we're

198
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,580
seeing us everywhere everything open I

199
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:03,380
guess exchange points to but api's

200
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,479
protocols open source all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

201
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything modular pluggable in these</font>

202
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,039
architectures and so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

203
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,139
future is about ecosystems<font color="#CCCCCC"> here right</font>

204
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,330
and we've seen we see this both in

205
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,190
nature and in other technology areas and

206
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,919
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting to it now we</font>

207
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,520
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it in compute here's</font>

208
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:24,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">another one that the employers weren't</font>

209
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,840
all that happy about which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

210
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:29,270
metric network-centric to aight aight IT

211
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,219
centric so this is what like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fce</font>

212
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,189
network function virtualization stuff is

213
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:36,349
all about but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it it represents a</font>

214
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,270
shift in not only influenced purchasing

215
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,769
influence and architectural influence

216
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,110
but speed so

217
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:46,230
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> net opposite DevOps is kind of</font>

218
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,850
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> summarize it there's other</font>

219
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,499
ones to everything virtualizes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

220
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,420
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this data centers yeah we've</font>

221
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:53,999
seen a integrated orchestration as

222
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,290
something people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> O's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font>

223
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,989
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen all these things</font>

224
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,269
happening and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line here is</font>

225
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:01,709
that you know it's again it's about

226
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,319
software you know it's integrated

227
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:06,089
orchestration of almost everything you

228
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,738
know and some of this is not desirable

229
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:10,079
because you know if you get integrated

230
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:11,699
or perhaps not desirable because if you

231
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,368
get integrated orchestration of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

232
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and starting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be your identity</font>

233
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:17,759
and other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there</font>

234
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:19,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're become privacy concerns and</font>

235
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,259
things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

236
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:25,910
as nice in some cases as you think as it

237
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,529
seems but the bottom line<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

238
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,360
increasing compute storage and network

239
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,999
power however you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

240
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,529
however you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure power it</font>

241
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:36,839
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just comes down it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

242
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:40,350
increasing volatility really and I'll

243
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,819
explain why<font color="#E5E5E5"> so oh yeah this stuff was</font>

244
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,889
supposed to have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

245
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:47,910
complexity in SD n so let me let me go

246
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:50,009
let me go there for a second so what was

247
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,110
the problem space that people were you

248
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,360
know how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have said have come</font>

249
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,100
up she and said well what problem does

250
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,389
sdn solve and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of try answer</font>

251
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,999
myself that question I couldn't really

252
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:03,209
figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so I tried a couple of</font>

253
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:04,410
different things and I went back and I

254
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:06,029
looked at the stuff that came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

255
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,589
Stanford you know which is sort of the

256
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:10,619
incubator for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff and</font>

257
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:12,540
basically that what they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying was</font>

258
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:15,299
this with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing in bold here which</font>

259
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,399
is basically you know how do we provide

260
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,350
state-of-the-art network infrastructure

261
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,269
and services while minimizing TCO and

262
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,290
that's kind of like okay everybody wants

263
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so the hypothesis here</font>

264
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,459
and the you know and this came from Nick

265
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,100
McEwen and<font color="#CCCCCC"> scotch anchor in these type</font>

266
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,199
of people was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was the lack or</font>

267
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,689
the inability to innovate in the network

268
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,868
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> underlying network itself coupled</font>

269
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:40,949
with the lack of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a program</font>

270
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:42,629
programmability you know proper

271
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:47,669
abstractions things like that that

272
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:48,959
really caused this problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

273
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:51,620
question whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not that's true so</font>

274
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:56,579
just hold that question

275
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:59,430
um and again here on again the future is

276
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:01,019
uncertain with even with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I how</font>

277
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,489
many people have heard this oh no don't

278
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,660
skate to where the puck is skate to

279
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,160
where the puck is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems</font>

280
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,199
like I hear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time right and</font>

281
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,640
I and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i thought hey</font>

282
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,260
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really cool that means you</font>

283
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,850
know the curve and you can just

284
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,620
integrate along the curve but here you

285
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know the curve and so that's kind</font>

286
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,860
of meaningless right so it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

287
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,800
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff out there and so if you</font>

288
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:26,880
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy the hypothesis for a second so</font>

289
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:31,140
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so okay oops can I go</font>

290
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,170
backwards yeah so thank you google

291
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,910
images um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I type complicated</font>

292
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,890
network or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goo</font>

293
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,630
I had this thing but I mean basically

294
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it you know I looked at it for a</font>

295
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,029
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I thought okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well there's</font>

296
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,380
some interesting things in this right

297
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,459
one is that there's all kinds of

298
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">different forwarding planes in our</font>

299
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,849
networks right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now like there's a fire</font>

300
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,769
walls there's routers or switches but

301
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:54,180
they're not they're not they're not

302
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">treated in any systematic way there's no</font>

303
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,260
network level view you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

304
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,130
bunch of boxes right and the other and

305
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,810
finally the configuration of this and

306
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,519
the policy are all intertwined so what's

307
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,739
the policy of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network well it's an</font>

308
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,970
acls and things like that or in a lot of

309
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are but maybe it's this you</font>

310
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,480
know protocol stacks now you know

311
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,760
working in the IETF over over many many

312
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">years one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've done</font>

313
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,699
I'm guilty as anyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like we'd</font>

314
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,019
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make protocols that's what we</font>

315
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,729
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we've built a bunch of</font>

316
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,589
protocols and so you got protocol stacks

317
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">that look like this and they have you</font>

318
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone or wherever you have</font>

319
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:31,380
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different protocols a lot of</font>

320
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,300
touch points but few abstractions open

321
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,029
interfaces or anything like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

322
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,000
all it's all a stack of things that are

323
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of almost unrelated and the result</font>

324
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,160
is the network gets becomes robust

325
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,959
because we put in a lot of complexity

326
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,699
basically to<font color="#CCCCCC"> creat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but at the same</font>

327
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,319
time it becomes fragile and this is

328
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:52,589
where this complexity stuff starts

329
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,420
starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm intersecting with all this so</font>

330
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,740
the network becomes has become robust

331
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,209
yet fragile now that sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

332
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,150
contradiction let's see if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

333
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:02,250
some sense out of that

334
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,630
so um this is kind of a famous curve if

335
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,430
you look at if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

336
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,750
large dynamic systems what they are that

337
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,910
they're heavy tailed curves and

338
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,710
basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is saying is like on</font>

339
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,630
the on the vertical axis that's its

340
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,060
robustness and usually that's

341
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,620
parameterised by some feature right and

342
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,119
then on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a horizontal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> axis there's</font>

343
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,430
complexity and what it basically saying

344
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,470
is if you look at let's see i hope i

345
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,910
shaded this yeah I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shade the</font>

346
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,350
area over the under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the curve but I</font>

347
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,010
don't know PowerPoint well enough so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

348
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:32,340
gave up but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you look at</font>

349
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:35,550
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve is rising or if you want</font>

350
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,990
convex that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are becoming</font>

351
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,660
more robust with the addition of

352
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,210
complexity and if you look on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

353
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,850
side of that where things are concave

354
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,700
then things start becoming fragile and

355
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,400
really what this curve is saying is you

356
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">need complexity to achieve robustness</font>

357
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,240
but it's there can be an upper bound on

358
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,440
that but there's no upper bound on how

359
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,060
much complexity you can put in your

360
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,280
network and I'm sure all of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

361
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,020
seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you get on the right</font>

362
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know p max number</font>

363
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,300
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a new job so</font>

364
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically as you as you move to the</font>

365
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,750
right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> increasing numbers</font>

366
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,170
of policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> get protocols configuration</font>

367
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,790
and their interaction and you know code

368
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,740
right I mean I was talking about

369
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:19,410
software and its effect but you know it

370
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,370
it itself is uncertain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and volatile I</font>

371
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,170
mean you know like your router would

372
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,820
never crash that wouldn't happen LAN

373
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,780
card wouldn't crash wouldn't have a bug

374
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:32,220
this never happens so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's volatile</font>

375
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:33,720
inherently so I start looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

376
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,100
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking at this stuff for</font>

377
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,460
a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of cross it</font>

378
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:42,150
with this software revolution or

379
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:44,070
evolution that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing and so first</font>

380
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,680
off let's see if we can get a definition

381
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,470
of robustness and fragility so

382
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,250
something's robust if it's invariant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

383
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,680
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of set of perturbations or</font>

384
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,230
events that happen in other words it's

385
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,270
in very it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't change right</font>

386
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,350
fragility is kind of the opposite

387
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,000
although it's a second order<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect I'll</font>

388
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,470
talk about that a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more but what's</font>

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,279
really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and this is sort</font>

390
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the network the network</font>

391
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,399
some science the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BioLab the biology</font>

392
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:14,120
biological systems people and the risk

393
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,189
engineering people have kind of come

394
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,930
together and the risk engineering guys

395
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:20,120
work on the fragility side quite a bit

396
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,040
more they try to do things like built

397
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,779
stress tests for banks in the EU and

398
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,589
things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect this kind</font>

399
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:29,360
of fragility but it's all the same stuff

400
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:33,019
so what it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a system can</font>

401
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,230
have a property that is that it you know

402
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,999
a system can be robust to some set of

403
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,209
things that happen but at the same time

404
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:45,079
be fragile to two other things and in

405
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:46,609
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the same things in fact and</font>

406
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,930
so these are trade-offs that happen and

407
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,170
these are kind of hard limits these

408
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,599
systems actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this a property of</font>

409
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,699
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems that this trade-off will</font>

410
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,230
exist so that I gave one example here

411
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:59,990
which is you know if you if you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

412
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:03,499
build<font color="#CCCCCC"> high efficiency optimization you</font>

413
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,439
basically create you know unreliability

414
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:08,480
perhaps or or hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evolve systems in</font>

415
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:11,480
other words optimization causes things

416
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,680
to be brittle right and we know that so

417
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,170
it's kind of a hard limit in these

418
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems and another you know I was</font>

419
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,689
talking to somebody else about this the

420
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,819
other day and they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna well what</font>

421
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:21,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened how about in a network and I</font>

422
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,490
can remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one time when we were</font>

423
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,100
building first building the campus

424
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">network where I work and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we the</font>

425
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,920
idea was okay well we'll put a subnet in

426
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,059
every building that's kind of intuitive

427
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,559
and we'll put a router interface in

428
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:32,689
every building and that's all really

429
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,100
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what happened was oh all of a</font>

430
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,990
sudden the thing was fragile to the loss

431
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,660
of the router interface so we wanted to

432
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">put another router interface in it to</font>

433
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,850
give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> some redundancy right okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

434
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:46,849
we didn't want hosts to have to carry

435
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,910
routing or know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so okay hsrp</font>

436
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,350
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> RRP but then okay so we created</font>

437
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,449
robustus the failure of the one

438
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:57,170
interface but in the process of doing

439
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:59,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we created fragility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bugs in the</font>

440
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,639
hsrp implementation MAC address

441
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:04,158
assignment all of this stuff so what you

442
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,289
saw there was you created robustness to

443
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:09,649
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it uncovered or created a</font>

444
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:13,549
fragility somewhere else this is a

445
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:14,898
general property of all these systems so

446
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:17,500
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some examples from nature and</font>

447
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:20,679
other places so

448
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,050
if you build in a human or in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mammal</font>

449
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,230
efficient and flexible metabolism that's

450
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:28,780
robust but we see it go wrong the same

451
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:35,380
mechanism creates OB obesity and

452
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:37,420
diabetes complex development what's

453
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,100
fragile is my crib systems right they

454
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,620
have complex development so they can

455
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,449
grow but they're also fragile immune

456
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,989
systems will<font color="#E5E5E5"> revolve seen this you know</font>

457
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:50,020
anti inflammatory or inflammatory and

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:52,210
autoimmune disease regeneration or no

459
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,030
it's extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> robust in mammals and</font>

460
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,920
humans but unfortunately it can go wrong

461
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,270
right so you can create and create

462
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,310
robustness and fragility at the same

463
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,980
time we have complex societies they are

464
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:05,020
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> robust but we got it we have</font>

465
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,030
epidemics we have war things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

466
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:11,440
and advanced technology is of course

467
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,700
nothing ever goes wrong there I mean

468
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,060
I've never seen anything go wrong there

469
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,410
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so it turns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

470
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's really fantastic it turns out</font>

471
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,760
that these evolved mechanisms for

472
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,860
robustness allow for or even they even

473
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,540
facilitate these novels severe

474
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,229
fragilities somewhere else in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

475
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:31,030
system and you know in it this is really

476
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,490
odd it often involves hijacking and

477
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,830
exploiting the same mechanism so we've

478
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,450
never seen that you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos</font>

479
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,699
amplification attacks all these things

480
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,510
same thing same thing so there's a

481
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,840
underlying systems theory that explains

482
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:48,960
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the behavior that we see as</font>

483
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,760
engineers and again as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said earlier</font>

484
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">this trade-off space is a hard</font>

485
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,420
constraint in these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

486
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,030
create robustness you will create

487
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,190
fragility somewhere else that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

488
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,500
the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I saw that said oh well</font>

489
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,990
maybe there's a design paradigm that we

490
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,820
can deduce from this because really at

491
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,100
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day all of this is it's</font>

492
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,020
interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we learn a lot but we</font>

493
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,199
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to build more robust and</font>

494
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:18,610
better networks scalable evolvable all

495
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,530
these sort of things so if you want to

496
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of think about what you can what</font>

497
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,850
robustness really is in a network you

498
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">can think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it kind of like this so</font>

499
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,990
scalability is a kind of robustness its

500
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,320
robustness to change this in the size

501
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,230
and complexity of a system

502
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh we want to build scalable networks</font>

503
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:38,389
obviously evolvability is a kind of

504
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,419
robustness its robustness to lineage to

505
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:45,199
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> two lineages to change this on long</font>

506
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:47,120
time scales we want to build scalable

507
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,909
any vulnerable networks the internet is

508
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,989
a good example of this you can look at

509
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,360
these other things too you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

510
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,059
reliability is robustus component

511
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,029
failure efficiency to resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> carcinus</font>

512
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:01,220
modularity so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very general</font>

513
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:03,110
thing and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of we think of these</font>

514
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,879
as engineering quantities but we don't

515
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,529
have a framework to stick them in yet

516
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:09,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is trying to a lot</font>

517
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:12,529
of this is starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so in our case</font>

518
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:15,049
you know protocols systems operations

519
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:20,899
all fit this and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff all</font>

520
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:23,120
the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a friend of mine told</font>

521
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:24,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">me that when you're given a talk like</font>

522
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,199
this for every equation you put in the

523
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,669
thing you learn to lose fifty percent so

524
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,289
don't use more than one equation because

525
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:32,629
you know pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decays</font>

526
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,940
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people are looking at</font>

527
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">their laptops what that's why I do</font>

528
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:41,779
anyway so but the fragility thing has

529
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,179
really been expanded by people in a

530
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:46,360
total different totally different domain

531
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:48,200
which is sort of a quantitative risk

532
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,758
management these are the guys who the

533
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,919
quants or the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are the quants</font>

534
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,379
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the you know the people who</font>

535
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,799
build these spectacularly complex models

536
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:59,539
for hedge funds and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

537
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,220
here's a bit of a formal description and

538
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:02,840
this is actually in a crazy thing

539
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,580
because I'd studied this for a long time

540
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then these guys from this other</font>

541
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,870
field came in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definition of</font>

542
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:12,709
fragility that fits so well but the

543
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:15,110
basic idea here is you have some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

544
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:20,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called it see and you have some</font>

545
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:23,029
function that map's this event and a

546
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:25,330
property on to what's called a harm

547
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:28,309
function right and it's negative value

548
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,509
excuse me so that's why I mean you can

549
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:31,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">flip the sign around and change the</font>

550
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:35,259
inequality that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really matter</font>

551
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:40,820
but the idea here is that the effect of

552
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:42,690
one big event is nonlinear and the small

553
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,010
event so basically on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left side</font>

554
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,410
this thing it says okay I have something

555
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a size n times Z that's a lot</font>

556
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:51,090
worse than n n times the smaller one and

557
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,290
I'll give some examples of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so you</font>

558
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">can understand because that's a really</font>

559
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,480
fantastic property and our networks out

560
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,060
that by the way so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the</font>

561
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,160
coffee cup right and you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

562
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,830
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe a thousand times or</font>

563
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,860
whatever it's like if you add up the

564
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:10,530
total distance that the thing has

565
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">traveled it'll be 10 feet or 15 feet but</font>

566
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,190
if I drop it once and it's fine right

567
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,680
it's no problem but if I drop it once

568
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,260
from 15 feet it gets destroyed this is

569
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,760
not linearly related and that's that's

570
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,770
the important property and as I said

571
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I said earlier that Fred fragility</font>

572
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:27,330
is a second order effect that's because

573
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,310
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually it's actually the</font>

574
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,399
acceleration of harm that's important

575
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:34,379
here so that's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

576
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,210
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fantastic thing and in fact</font>

577
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,980
nature requires this right so if you

578
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,440
walk around you lift your feet up you

579
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:43,200
know what five centimeters every time

580
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,120
you walk if you draw if you what if you

581
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,680
jump off something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 meters high</font>

582
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,679
you're going to die right but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

583
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,050
walk around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I we're all okay are for the</font>

584
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,580
most part and so it's required that

585
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:58,470
there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonlinear relationship</font>

586
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:00,360
otherwise we'd all be dead um so um you

587
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,250
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a new way</font>

588
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,610
of looking at the fragility piece of the

589
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,890
ry<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff um so what else do I have in</font>

590
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">here oh yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the other thing</font>

591
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,250
it's related to scaling how many times

592
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,720
have you guys somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> said oh that</font>

593
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,310
scales like n square how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

594
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,680
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because we say it a lot</font>

595
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,750
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have adjacencies and so we</font>

596
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,540
have n choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things to look at and</font>

597
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:24,780
that's n square well what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font>

598
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,100
means is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the harm function if</font>

599
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,620
you want to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this way is</font>

600
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,010
really has this constant acceleration it

601
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,199
gets bad with constant acceleration on 2

602
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,860
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the second derivative of N</font>

603
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,360
squared when<font color="#E5E5E5"> things get weird enough you</font>

604
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,639
know when you get when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get big or</font>

605
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,590
weird and so you think it but you might

606
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,840
think its theoretical but it's really

607
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,510
not you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ARP storms congestion</font>

608
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,310
collapse<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s700 7d das</font>

609
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,250
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it all causes this</font>

610
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:56,669
nonlinear damage so this gives us a

611
00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:03,880
framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of understand how</font>

612
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:05,410
these these events affect us<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me</font>

613
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,550
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about anti fertility</font>

614
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,570
this is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was telling</font>

615
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,010
somebody earlier this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

616
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that's really captured many</font>

617
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,390
people's imagination it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a new</font>

618
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,760
idea robustness and fragility are the

619
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,190
opposite of one another anti fragility

620
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,320
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different an anti fragile</font>

621
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,690
system improves as the result of stress

622
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,820
so what's an example of this your

623
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,280
skeletal and muscular systems if you

624
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,260
don't have gravity and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress of</font>

625
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,690
gravity your bones will just deteriorate

626
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,370
they require stress right but this is

627
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,280
found in all kinds of systems economy is

628
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,389
forest ecosystems Internet's things like

629
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,360
that so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some</font>

630
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,860
metaphors for this is if something's

631
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,240
fragile what happens like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

632
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,520
send something in the mail you goats

633
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,770
fragile what can happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it well it</font>

634
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,960
can in the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> case that can arrive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

635
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,790
its destination undamaged in the worst

636
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,430
case it gets completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroyed that's</font>

637
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:57,300
what fragile is so upper bound it's okay

638
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:59,890
lower bound complete destroyed<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

639
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,110
what's what if something's robust if

640
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,540
something's robust it just survives the

641
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:07,090
mail it doesn't get damaged it won't get

642
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,280
damaged and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll get there as you know</font>

643
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,820
undamaged but if something's anti

644
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,410
fragile the lower bound<font color="#E5E5E5"> is its robust</font>

645
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,899
but the upper bound is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually gets</font>

646
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,130
better so be like if I sense something I

647
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,240
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> this doesn't happen obviously but</font>

648
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,830
it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like if I sense something in the</font>

649
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,570
mail in and it got all beat up but<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

650
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the process of it getting beat up</font>

651
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:28,750
made it better now is this abstract not

652
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:31,629
really Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> cow he just wrote an</font>

653
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,970
excellent blog on peering and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> syrian</font>

654
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet crisis that went on there and</font>

655
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,110
explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it was anti fragile so</font>

656
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,660
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened um there were stressed to</font>

657
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the system you know governmental</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

658
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,010
of key access points not enough

659
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,260
diversity<font color="#E5E5E5"> in peering all of that stuff</font>

660
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,000
what happens internet engineers build

661
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,270
ways around this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network becomes</font>

662
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,640
more complex but more robust so the

663
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet itself is anti fragile what's</font>

664
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,250
the interesting idea something to think

665
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,680
about when you're building things so

666
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,740
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what it all comes down to</font>

667
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,410
at the end of the day I like this

668
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,240
definition for<font color="#E5E5E5"> complexity is basically a</font>

669
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,190
so the Internet's a highly organized

670
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,500
system it's not random it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bunch</font>

671
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of random stuff it's highly organized so</font>

672
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,260
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about complexity and</font>

673
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:20,139
organized systems it's about that

674
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,930
structure itself and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

675
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:26,130
arises from design properties that all

676
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:29,410
of us build to create to create

677
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,690
optimizations or to create robustness to

678
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,640
uncertainty in their environments and

679
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,310
their components so what do you do the

680
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,590
hsrp thing or what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have</font>

681
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:43,210
you know diverse appearing things like

682
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:46,209
that so this might also be obvious but

683
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:48,100
um you know what networks a really

684
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:53,220
general thing it turns up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in nature all</font>

685
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:55,510
the time it's a graph right and you know

686
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,850
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see are</font>

687
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,740
our network so these things are are

688
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,300
common in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

689
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,250
the internet it started this artifact

690
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,560
that we built but actually it has a lot

691
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,060
in common with<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like I'm</font>

692
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,490
mentioning here like energy metabolism

693
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,429
like transportation systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the</font>

694
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,990
main sequence and stellar evolution and

695
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,460
I remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> when my kids are small i used</font>

696
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,570
to tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're at costco</font>

697
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,590
and we're standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in line i used to</font>

698
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,389
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them yeah well you know</font>

699
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,860
everything's either a network or a QC

700
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,940
everything you can see is almost

701
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:28,090
explainable that way so and that's true

702
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,940
so it comes as probably not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

703
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:33,070
surprised that even as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

704
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,190
we're network people<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of this stuff</font>

705
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,980
comes from studying other systems that

706
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">give us clues as to how we can build</font>

707
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:45,720
more reliable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more robust network so</font>

708
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,720
biological systems on things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

709
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,710
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's nice but</font>

710
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,530
what does it mean for us where you know

711
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:57,790
us means you know operators engineers

712
00:27:53,530 --> 00:28:00,250
architects you know and and how how can

713
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:02,320
the effective is really change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

714
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,580
we build and operate networks so keep

715
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,610
that in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we'll come back to</font>

716
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,610
that

717
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I've been you know I'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

718
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,120
in a sec here one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

719
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">been trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do over the years is sort</font>

720
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,439
of bridge this gap between the guys who

721
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing the science because it gets</font>

722
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,620
pretty it gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty difficult the</font>

723
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,059
people who are doing the science it gets

724
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,918
pretty difficult and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have</font>

725
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:25,320
some serious physics chops to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

726
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,360
this stuff and any and it gets away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

727
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay people like us pretty quickly</font>

728
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,539
but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some really good</font>

729
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:36,389
intuition we can get from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so</font>

730
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:39,120
these architectural takeaways are things

731
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,070
that came from other domains but are

732
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,289
directly applicable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the internet</font>

733
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:47,939
space so in the in this work and this

734
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:49,980
work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have been doing in a</font>

735
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,600
diverse set of domains it turns out that

736
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,940
there's there are fundamental

737
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,439
architectural building blocks that are

738
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,059
found in these systems that are both

739
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,610
scalable and evolve about and of course

740
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,928
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want right our way of</font>

741
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,549
complexity I talked a little bit about

742
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:04,230
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a counterintuitive</font>

743
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:06,030
thing but its core to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

744
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,500
bowtie architectures I'll talk about

745
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:11,190
that in a second I'm massively

746
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:14,730
distributed with robust control tcp bgp

747
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:17,130
um and let's see what else Oh highly

748
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,539
layered we have that but we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

749
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,220
layer violations that's also a

750
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:22,289
characteristic so these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

751
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,510
layers all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems are layered</font>

752
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:26,820
but they had layer violations tcp IP

753
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,350
layer violation I don't know what Warren

754
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,939
was talking about one at breakfast this

755
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,110
morning I forgot which what it was

756
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,640
somebody said oh that's a layer

757
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,189
violation or maybe I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was rude agree i'm</font>

758
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,140
not sure layer violations are inherent

759
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,419
part of these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

760
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,900
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> had not that have a they have</font>

761
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,429
protocols well yeah and there's a

762
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,630
property called degeneracy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll come</font>

763
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,730
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have time it's</font>

764
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:51,960
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like redundancy but more</font>

765
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:56,059
general and it aids in in evolvability

766
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,320
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems okay so here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bowties</font>

767
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:00,178
this is an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came from systems</font>

768
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,700
biology i love systems biology it's very

769
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,700
cool but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyways this idea came up from</font>

770
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,620
a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the site to the</font>

771
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,289
paper there but the idea was there's

772
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,719
constraints that d constrain so here's

773
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:14,280
the idea on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how this is a</font>

774
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,440
bow tie and there's a knot this is the

775
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,940
metaphor these guys she's right and you

776
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,330
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the left side of this on</font>

777
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,850
the input

778
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,158
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what's there well it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

779
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,590
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> munch it you know chemical</font>

780
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:29,720
phenomenon going on but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

781
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:32,668
there's a highly specialized rigid a

782
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,169
kind of basically information processing

783
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:35,700
unit is what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then on the right</font>

784
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:37,710
side you build everything on top of that

785
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,419
now why is that a constraint that<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

786
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,340
constraints because on the right side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

787
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,950
it well let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side on</font>

788
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,570
the left side it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any input so</font>

789
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,039
it's unconstrained on the left side on

790
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right side you can build anything</font>

791
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,658
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want including all of life so the</font>

792
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,769
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have here is I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

793
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have biology in their</font>

794
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:57,840
background but there's a molecule called

795
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:59,610
ATP adenosine triphosphate which every

796
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,649
cell on the planet uses for energy

797
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,149
metabolism so once you know you're going

798
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:06,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have that you can build all of life</font>

799
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:08,879
on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so that's that's how life</font>

800
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:11,760
that's one of the bow ties in biology

801
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting but</font>

802
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,470
what how is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to what we're</font>

803
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,570
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know anything look</font>

804
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,100
familiar so this thing on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is</font>

805
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:24,389
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet hourglass how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

806
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:27,480
have seen that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this explains for</font>

807
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:29,519
example why the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is adaptable</font>

808
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,850
the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but it also explains why</font>

809
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,409
certain things are rigid expense why

810
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,830
it's hard to it's hard to deploy ipv6

811
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:39,179
why because ipv6 is in the knot or in

812
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,889
the narrow waist that's what we call it

813
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet space but it's in it's in</font>

814
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:46,740
the not right it also explains<font color="#CCCCCC"> why it's</font>

815
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,960
hard to deploy ipsec same reason but

816
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a feature of any scalable system</font>

817
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll have so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bow tie is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

818
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,529
like if you view things this

819
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,850
horizontally layered and we look at it

820
00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">as vertically layered but it's the same</font>

821
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:03,389
phenomenon so that's just that now if a

822
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,279
system doesn't have that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't ask</font>

823
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:07,830
what does that mean right and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

824
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,919
to that so back to so this had something

825
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,299
to do with sdn and complexity so what

826
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,779
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we even get here you know so</font>

827
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:18,389
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea was everything that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

828
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:20,029
networking was just to vertically

829
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:22,469
integrated just too tightly coupled

830
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:24,330
non-standard no interfaces in again and

831
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,039
it kind of goes without saying that

832
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:29,129
these folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are cooking this stuff</font>

833
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,690
up in the early days we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying hey we</font>

834
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,160
can't do our work we can't do research

835
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,560
because

836
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,910
can't see inside any of this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

837
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,500
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all really cool and that's</font>

838
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably true but does that have</font>

839
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,370
anything to do with the with running a

840
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,129
production<font color="#CCCCCC"> network I'm you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold</font>

841
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,229
that question i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure i don't i</font>

842
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:49,190
don't know but if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdn</font>

843
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,840
thesis and put it a different way um the

844
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,550
idea was ok well we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what</font>

845
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,010
happened in the computer industry right

846
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:57,169
so virtualization layer all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind</font>

847
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,690
of stuff and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was oh well it's</font>

848
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,750
this right um and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standard</font>

849
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:06,500
you know Sdn picture right and so the

850
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:09,470
question is this um is this good analogy

851
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,510
really and I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing on</font>

852
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,460
the right is characterized by complete

853
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:16,250
separation of control and data is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

854
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:19,460
good idea um you know just ask the

855
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:21,200
question open interfaces to the

856
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:24,020
forwarding plane I don't know if that's

857
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,480
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of centralized</font>

858
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,100
control and it you know i'll talk about

859
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,650
this in a second logically centralized

860
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,090
right so if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a closer look this</font>

861
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,440
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick McEwen picture this is</font>

862
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,629
really what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is right so there's a</font>

863
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,650
controller piece of software it's a

864
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,600
piece of middleware there's some

865
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,250
applications routing whatever and then

866
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,199
there's this open interface open flow

867
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,000
and a bunch of switches right that's the

868
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">real picture right if you drill down a</font>

869
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,730
little bit now I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to James</font>

870
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,710
Hamilton about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I was saying you</font>

871
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,030
know that the whole analogy thing is

872
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,590
kind of bothering me so he handed me

873
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,740
this slide right and he said well this

874
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:59,350
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what's going on on basically</font>

875
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,700
the architecture so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

876
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:05,929
this changed us the architecture of the

877
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:08,540
network and the devices in it if you

878
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:11,330
look at this really what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

879
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,940
was there was a standard kind of a

880
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,500
standard instruction set x86 and then

881
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything opened up you know sudden i</font>

882
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,860
have linux now I have everything open

883
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,540
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was about</font>

884
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,810
everything open it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really change</font>

885
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:26,330
the architecture so it doesn't look to

886
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,429
me like that analogy is very good and in

887
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,840
fact again it's another one of these

888
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:31,010
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know my employers don't</font>

889
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,490
like but this is what I really think

890
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a better analogy is if you had a</font>

891
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:39,229
really robust open source network OS and

892
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,779
protocol stack and you ran that on and

893
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,250
you had it on a white box of some sort

894
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,629
that would be more like

895
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:50,389
I got linux on my favorite x86 anyway

896
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:54,440
you know so I'm questioning that as a as

897
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:55,429
a underlying thesis oh yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

898
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,340
mention this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is logically</font>

899
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:00,290
centralized right so we know one of the

900
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,520
things we know from our experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

901
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,620
from system science like I was

902
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,690
describing is that for scalability and

903
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:08,420
robustness and resilience you need

904
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,250
distributed systems right so really the

905
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,990
central controller can't be centralized

906
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,120
that means it's a distributed system

907
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,740
right so these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with this</font>

908
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,839
word called logically centralized which

909
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,669
means distributed why we need new words

910
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,570
for that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really sure but once</font>

911
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:25,280
you have a distributed system you have

912
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:27,920
inherent trade-offs in scalability and

913
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,230
and control plane convergence that are

914
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,910
just basically fundamental stuff from

915
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,470
distributed systems I don't know if

916
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">people know what the captain is but it</font>

917
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:38,120
explains what these trade-offs are and

918
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:40,339
there's another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing here right now you</font>

919
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,660
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken that if you do this you</font>

920
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,820
break the Fate sharing between the

921
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,740
control and data plane and so that puts

922
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,960
a lower bound on how fast control plane

923
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,609
can actually converge there's actually

924
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,930
physics<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved here right I mean</font>

925
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:52,550
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send it yet to</font>

926
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,589
detect it so that's to be a packet that

927
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,790
goes between the controller and the

928
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,890
switch or the switch in the controller

929
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,810
so you got the RTP there and then you

930
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,540
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to process that packet on each side</font>

931
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:04,549
so you have packet processing time plus

932
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,380
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT and you might have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

933
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,060
along a whole path because remember the

934
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">openflow sdn model sets up what are</font>

935
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,230
essentially soft<font color="#CCCCCC"> pvcs right so there's</font>

936
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:16,130
paths that it's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are set up that you</font>

937
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:17,780
have to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can ask yourself you</font>

938
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,040
know what are the implications of this

939
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:23,810
with respect to resilience and

940
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,340
conversions isn't this is another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

941
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,830
there's really nothing new here this has

942
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">been tried many many times you know it</font>

943
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,720
works in circuit switching sometimes it

944
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:35,330
hasn't really as far as I know work too

945
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,919
well in packet networking I don't know

946
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,620
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flow-based</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forwarding has</font>

947
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,940
been tried in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet space many</font>

948
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:45,470
times so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a brief aside</font>

949
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,420
on what open flow is because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

950
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,399
tell people a little bit about what this

951
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,780
is with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> critical</font>

952
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,130
or skeptical eye towards it because

953
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,829
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard people talk about</font>

954
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font>

955
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:57,450
um it's usually a it's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sales</font>

956
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:59,339
job and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about it a</font>

957
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,078
little more so here was the original

958
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:02,489
switch model<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I'm not sure where</font>

959
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,529
this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> came from I couldn't find</font>

960
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:07,559
where I got it from but basically this

961
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:09,779
was the sort of what open flow when I

962
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,640
was so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you think about it was just</font>

963
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:13,109
a TKO so a packet would come to the

964
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,150
thing if there's a matching rule it

965
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:16,680
would do whatever the tcam you know

966
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,539
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the match action table told it</font>

967
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,219
to do you know like the HCL table on

968
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">your router and it would afford it right</font>

969
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:24,630
if not if it got a mess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could do</font>

970
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,190
is it could redirect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet to the</font>

971
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,709
controller in which case it would set up

972
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,660
a path if it had that and then send the

973
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:32,848
packet back to the head end or it could

974
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,160
drop the packet so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was</font>

975
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:36,539
was there's a switch model which is this

976
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,538
match action table stuff I just

977
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:41,339
described there's a wire protocol some

978
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:43,380
kind of way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of communicating this and</font>

979
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:47,038
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to transport over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP your</font>

980
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:49,170
SSL or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what was</font>

981
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,880
what was going on with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this well first</font>

982
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,799
off it was to you know it's intuitively

983
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,479
nice it but it's too simple because

984
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:56,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's not a future functionality gaps</font>

985
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:59,609
and then it wasn't expressive enough the

986
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,130
language itself actually precluded you

987
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:04,369
for doing a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

988
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:07,079
know that think are obvious for example

989
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:10,589
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Florida</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encouraged or you r</font>

990
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,839
PF and longest prefix match the same

991
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">time so all right that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font>

992
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:17,788
so this is the next model this is open

993
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,190
full of 11 and beyond so it's multi

994
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:22,079
table and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of similar the</font>

995
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,299
packet comes to the thing to the switch

996
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,920
if there's a match in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case what it</font>

997
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:27,839
does is it just collects the actions

998
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,400
instead of executing them immediately

999
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,869
until the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pipeline and then</font>

1000
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,359
it executes them and the reason for that

1001
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">is because every table wants to see the</font>

1002
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,229
original package so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't actually</font>

1003
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:39,269
modify it you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually but if</font>

1004
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:40,589
you do modify it in in flight you know

1005
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:42,508
it's pretty non deterministic what's

1006
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:45,420
going to happen so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a good why do</font>

1007
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:46,319
this right first off<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um it's</font>

1008
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,529
because there's a combinatorial

1009
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:51,538
explosion of routes versus policies and

1010
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:53,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">t cams are typically not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that big in</font>

1011
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:56,729
fact it t cams<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hottest least</font>

1012
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:58,589
efficient part of forwarding paths and

1013
00:38:56,729 --> 00:39:01,618
so building a whole switch on that is

1014
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:02,670
kind of I don't know so but I kind of

1015
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:04,259
looked at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little more and I</font>

1016
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,990
thought well okay that's cool what but

1017
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,850
you know

1018
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,890
what really can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know well I try to</font>

1019
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,330
compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complexity of just finding a</font>

1020
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,970
path in this thing because I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1021
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,910
sure people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done this but no so</font>

1022
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,919
it's at least n factorial right because

1023
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:19,839
the first table<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yemen ways of choosing</font>

1024
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,760
it the second way of n<font color="#E5E5E5"> minus 1 blah blah</font>

1025
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,190
blah so funds n factorial paths in this

1026
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,610
but it's worse because the constants in

1027
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:31,780
there are gigantic but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you</font>

1028
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:33,670
can conquer that but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's too</font>

1029
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,400
complex and too brittle as I said that

1030
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:39,070
the algorithmic complexity is just too

1031
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,860
high what's a flow in this nobody can

1032
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">even describe what a flow is it's not</font>

1033
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,070
naturally implementable on a sick

1034
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,200
hardware for the reasons I mentioned and

1035
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,760
there's a lot of other reasons there's a

1036
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,960
bunch of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the abstraction</font>

1037
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,700
itself and there's architectural

1038
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,980
questions which you know that's a whole

1039
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,480
nother talk we could do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell</font>

1040
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the oh and a half there's a</font>

1041
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,690
group called<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding a working group</font>

1042
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,089
called forwarding abstractions what

1043
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,740
whose main goal is try to constrain

1044
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:05,020
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually implementable</font>

1045
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:09,160
on something I mean obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> simpla</font>

1046
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:11,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">mental in software but in hardware so</font>

1047
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,850
again the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for all of you</font>

1048
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,920
guys for<font color="#E5E5E5"> four to think about is is</font>

1049
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,390
really is the flow based abstraction the

1050
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,609
right thing for general network

1051
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:25,868
programmability maybe maybe not so now

1052
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:27,850
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my perhaps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> controversial view so</font>

1053
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:30,010
open flow and sdn are a design point in

1054
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:32,650
sort of a larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> space of things and</font>

1055
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,450
people like to you know divide this up

1056
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:37,810
in different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways but it's not the only</font>

1057
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,819
one the largest space has things like

1058
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,200
control plane programmability<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know how</font>

1059
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:44,260
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are following the IETF but</font>

1060
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,930
this is things like I to RS BG pls<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alto</font>

1061
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,630
you know so forth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's overlays</font>

1062
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,950
you know vmware nasira and then there's

1063
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,210
compute storage and network

1064
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,439
programmability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think everybody</font>

1065
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,430
will be glad to hear that there's

1066
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,060
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called software-defined</font>

1067
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,680
storage now to wherever that might be so

1068
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no there's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one but I</font>

1069
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,450
have this other model it's that I'm

1070
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">calling a continuum right and this is by</font>

1071
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,868
the way I can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw in</font>

1072
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,160
PowerPoint I don't have the patience for

1073
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:11,560
it so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best thing i</font>

1074
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,560
could make but so if you look on the

1075
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,870
left you have

1076
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,670
thing that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling fording point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdn</font>

1077
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's characterized by all the things</font>

1078
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,330
i was mentioning for open flow you know

1079
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,460
separation of control and data logically

1080
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,319
centralized control<font color="#E5E5E5"> open interface to</font>

1081
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,550
the open interface to the forwarding

1082
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,280
plane and these are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1083
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:30,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">openflow sdn forces could fall in here</font>

1084
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,380
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know forces in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle there's</font>

1085
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,150
some control plane sdn I'm calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1086
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,920
control plane sdn<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this has the</font>

1087
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,720
property that you maintain the existing

1088
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,480
distributed control plane but you make

1089
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,799
it programmable that's I to RS and all

1090
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,970
of those things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> netcom etc and</font>

1091
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,680
then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go sort of to the other</font>

1092
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,029
side of it where you have overlay what

1093
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,910
I'm calling overlay estima so what's

1094
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,770
over last in this is where you just you

1095
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care that much about the</font>

1096
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,960
underlying control plane or forwarding

1097
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:03,440
plane as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have I don't know</font>

1098
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,430
32 64 128 by you know ecmp or something

1099
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,500
like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just put another</font>

1100
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,000
control plane on top of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1101
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,960
there's a there's a highly dimensional

1102
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,420
space in here of things that can be done

1103
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,060
so back to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just to try to</font>

1104
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:19,850
tie this up a little bit if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

1105
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,890
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just using this one of</font>

1106
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,970
those features<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was saying because you</font>

1107
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,040
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of look for these kind of</font>

1108
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,569
things and say well do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things have</font>

1109
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,920
these properties or not so if you look

1110
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this control plane st and this</font>

1111
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't really affect the architecture</font>

1112
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,560
of the network you know it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

1113
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,170
gives you more programmability of the

1114
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,090
existing control plane the overlay sdn

1115
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,040
thing is just an application to the IP

1116
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:43,340
layer the IP layer doesn't really know

1117
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,840
about it now open<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow stn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1118
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,310
really know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where that fits I don't even</font>

1119
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,440
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it has this structure I couldn't</font>

1120
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,330
really nail that down I tried for a

1121
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,420
while but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't I couldn't see it</font>

1122
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:54,920
exactly so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure about that so if</font>

1123
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,870
it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this property was it say</font>

1124
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,040
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scalability that's a question</font>

1125
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">huh oh yeah and of course you have</font>

1126
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,020
software right stuff you know again this

1127
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:08,299
is it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you if you combine</font>

1128
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">open-loop control software and Moore's</font>

1129
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:14,000

1130
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:17,120
volatility trust me so where's it all

1131
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,070
going yeah so I typed the I type that

1132
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,650
into Google Images and I got this thing

1133
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,970
as hybrid I'm drowning and garbage

1134
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:28,860
saying we're drowning in garbage I just

1135
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the picture more seriously I think</font>

1136
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:35,640
the high-order bit here is something

1137
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:37,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know because of all this</font>

1138
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,779
volatility that's coming basically from

1139
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,320
software that everything's everything's

1140
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:46,350
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty much cloudy for a</font>

1141
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,510
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe permanently I think a</font>

1142
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:50,339
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we work in the</font>

1143
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,230
narrow waist part of the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

1144
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the most stable piece of it but if</font>

1145
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,220
you're above that things can get things

1146
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:58,470
are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get interesting and I just</font>

1147
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,029
give an example here of a look at my

1148
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,830
time I give an example here of something

1149
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">like spot cloud you know it's a it's a</font>

1150
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:06,450
spot market for compute right amazon has

1151
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:08,370
12 and what happens here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just</font>

1152
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,230
buy a vm anywhere on the planet and spin

1153
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,000
it up you could put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a routed network on</font>

1154
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,250
top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

1155
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,110
cloud on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so once you once you</font>

1156
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,490
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that the idea</font>

1157
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:20,520
that you would understand you know

1158
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:22,560
deeply what your traffic matrix look

1159
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,720
like from on any kind of time

1160
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,830
granularity well we've seen what happens

1161
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,140
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1162
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,580
you know conventional technology curves

1163
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,500
are going to hang around we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font>

1164
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,210
yesterday or the nice talk about optical

1165
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,190
we know we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get 400 and 1.6</font>

1166
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">an element or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more core density all of</font>

1167
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,250
that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in that sort of</font>

1168
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,200
corresponds to the you know reptilian

1169
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,870
brain piece of it somebody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1170
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,250
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to forward packets eventually I</font>

1171
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:49,650
mentioned this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> about ecosystems I</font>

1172
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,710
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't can't make that point</font>

1173
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,810
strongly enough and open everything but

1174
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:58,310
ok so just to wrap this up what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1175
00:44:54,810 --> 00:45:03,360
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about all those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff well</font>

1176
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:05,100
so my sense of it is is that um we

1177
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,480
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to protect architectural</font>

1178
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,790
features of the network that have made

1179
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">it scale and made it operable so things</font>

1180
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,360
like the narrow waist we're pretty good

1181
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,570
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean you know that you know we</font>

1182
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,710
did ipv6 that's been troublesome but you

1183
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,880
know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting there with that but</font>

1184
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,280
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't</font>

1185
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the IP layer a lot and we're</font>

1186
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good at component reuse you know</font>

1187
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,110
traceroute as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned earlier and a</font>

1188
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:28,250
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other component reuse that's</font>

1189
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:30,200
that's a good thing um

1190
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,670
and I I mentioned this I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

1191
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,410
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this again but just expect a lot of</font>

1192
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:34,970
volatility coming from the top the

1193
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:37,370
bottoms not so much right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1194
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware in general unless it's v switch</font>

1195
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,700
or something and it moves slower but

1196
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,430
above its software and it can move at

1197
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,960
any rate devops<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we all</font>

1198
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to get in in the groove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that</font>

1199
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that several nanog segovia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jay</font>

1200
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,480
was talking about the kind of people he

1201
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">was wanting to hire and i think it was</font>

1202
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,330
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the term dead laughs actually was</font>

1203
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:58,370
even you know coined you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1204
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,870
another property is that like in the

1205
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:01,580
internet space we we develop our

1206
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:06,490
understanding kind of bottom-up that's

1207
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:10,160
an important thing to maintain and<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

1208
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:12,319
you know design I mean my sense of it is

1209
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,899
that we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to expect and</font>

1210
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,550
understand where we're designing

1211
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,770
robustus and fragility<font color="#E5E5E5"> and build things</font>

1212
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,080
that will help us evolve we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1213
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">go a lot of times we don't think we have</font>

1214
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,390
extension headers we have things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1215
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but a lot of times we don't think</font>

1216
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,990
about evolvability and there are

1217
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,480
properties that that we could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1218
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that allow that so that's kind of</font>

1219
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,970
summary of all of this stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1220
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:41,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done yes done to get a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1221
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:44,299
anyone oh good hey Todd Underwood google

1222
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:47,840
so thanks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk to a pile of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1223
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">think one of the things that there's a</font>

1224
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,950
set of network architectural principles

1225
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,540
going on the sort of most mundane part

1226
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the talk because the other parts</font>

1227
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,120
probably too hard for me to understand

1228
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,759
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just focusing on the concrete</font>

1229
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,500
part so that I could follow so when you

1230
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,910
look at the general I mean most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it oh</font>

1231
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:06,650
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was oddly no so when you look</font>

1232
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:08,899
at like you're assigning specific

1233
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:13,000
architectural or implementation

1234
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,830
strategies to robustness or to fragility

1235
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,170
that seemed pretty unmotivated and

1236
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:20,330
pretty unjustified so in particular it's

1237
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">not clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that massively</font>

1238
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:25,790
distributed systems are not themselves

1239
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:27,770
pretty fragile we we spend a lot of time

1240
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,810
on cascading failures and cascading

1241
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:32,240
failures are enormously difficult to

1242
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:34,610
mitigate in distributed systems so

1243
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one point so the other point is</font>

1244
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:39,860
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a niggling point but like</font>

1245
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:41,240
convergence times<font color="#E5E5E5"> on separated control</font>

1246
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,900
plane and forwarding plane you talk

1247
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,279
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the round trip</font>

1248
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,930
time between the controller and the

1249
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,210
forwarding notes like what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1250
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:48,830
like multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop round-trip time</font>

1251
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:50,390
between forwarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> planes finding out</font>

1252
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,069
about remote failures which is

1253
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:55,040
convergence takes a long time and

1254
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,780
distributed routing protocols yes so let

1255
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,870
me let me take the second one first<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1256
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:02,300
so what we do is we use it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1257
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:05,630
eventual consistency so that we don't

1258
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that right actually I didn't</font>

1259
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,660
have time to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but cap</font>

1260
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:12,800
theorem basically says cap theorem says

1261
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,569
you can have consistency meaning common

1262
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> states consistent everywhere you can</font>

1263
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:20,330
have availability or you can have

1264
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:23,180
partitioned tolerance cap<font color="#CCCCCC"> c AP and but</font>

1265
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's choose any two and so what we did</font>

1266
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,290
in what we did in the internet space and

1267
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,760
we didn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage really of the</font>

1268
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:30,950
deep knowledge of it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

1269
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,030
distributed systems community is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1270
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,620
built something called eventual

1271
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:36,350
consistency so we didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

1272
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,330
and yeah if you had to have strong

1273
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:40,100
consistency constraints then the

1274
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:43,430
problems that you were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> describing</font>

1275
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:46,040
what arise but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't so we tolerate</font>

1276
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,419
things like micro Lutz and transient

1277
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,690
black<font color="#E5E5E5"> hall holes and things like that</font>

1278
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:53,510
and the trade-off is is the convergence

1279
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,890
time right sure I'm just saying the the

1280
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:58,070
second point sort of mingling I'm just

1281
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:00,620
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the consequence of and</font>

1282
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:02,510
the distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those outages are</font>

1283
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,890
just as bad and distributed routing

1284
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:06,230
protocols as they are when you have a

1285
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:07,940
semi centralized control plane yeah I

1286
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:09,560
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> disagree i'm just trading off a</font>

1287
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,300
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of latency in a different</font>

1288
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,340
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> months yeah and just like ryf</font>

1289
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,810
thing is about just those trade-offs go

1290
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,190
back to cascading failures and tell me

1291
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,830
how to fix that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1302
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:51,420
that networking faces today especially

1303
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:54,300
in the data center space is the

1304

mainframe business model the violation

1305
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,050
of the end-to-end principle the

1306
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:00,450
networking vendors in their attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1307
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:02,190
make it vertically integrated are saying

1308
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,140
the network is the centerpiece of the

1309
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:06,960
world and everything has to be subsumed

1310
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,790
in there and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process of that we</font>

1311

have complicated the<font color="#E5E5E5"> centerpiece so much</font>

1312
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:15,119
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> either innovate around it or</font>

1313
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:17,310
find ways to break this opaque blob in

admit that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing um but</font>

1334
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:34,020
the fear of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a distributed algorithms is</font>

um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think a circuit zilla problem um</font>

1336
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:39,359
the telcos just don't believe in

1337
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:43,890
datagrams and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe in</font>

1338
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:48,000
distributed algorithms and yes you have

1339
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:51,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more formal a little</font>

1340
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,260

survived on them for a long time

00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:03,810
complexity is and fragility are not

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,790
bunch of funny monkeys are doing this

1346
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:16,049
stuff and the funny monkeys do

1347
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:18,029
Parkinson's real well and we push

1348
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:21,750
distributed algorithms to the point

1349
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:25,980
where we get annoyed at their ugliness

1350
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:28,170
and if we centralize things all that

1351
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,329
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is give us time windows for a</font>

1352
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:33,170
couple years before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we complicate that</font>

1353
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:35,970
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough that it's going to be screwed</font>

1354
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:40,380
right centralizing it is not a panacea

1355
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:45,180
for our complexity disease and but what

1356
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:48,390
it does do is decouple the control plane

1357
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:50,540
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> date plane and I think we've</font>

1358
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:55,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">learned time and again in this industry</font>

1359
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:59,359
that having two layers that relate to

1360
00:52:55,770 --> 00:53:05,829
each other that our non congruent are

1361
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:10,410
always really fun just uglier than hell
