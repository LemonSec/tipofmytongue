1
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,180
so I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited to see this</font>

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,220
presentation you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is discussing</font>

3
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,370
distributed mesh infrastructures with

4
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,050
all of the tumult and turmoil that we've

5
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,480
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world one thing that we</font>

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,519
know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the network needs</font>

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,890
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> resilient and finding new ways to</font>

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,629
interconnect people you know aside from

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:49,190
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just think about of you know</font>

10
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:53,120
fiber is is critical and so I'd like

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:01:03,019
Sasha and I guess josh king to come up

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:07,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">here and present on this thank you thank</font>

13
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:09,830
you how's everyone today silent

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,909
seriously thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all for coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

15
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:17,360
here I'm actually used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speaking in DC</font>

16
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,549
to a bunch of Hill folks and white house

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in State Department people and</font>

18
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm used to being kind of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> geek</font>

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,810
geekiest person in the room and now I

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,729
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a lilliputian</font>

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,130
nerd compared to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge and</font>

22
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,810
expertise that's here and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why</font>

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,600
I've actually asked my technical lead

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Josh King to come in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because for all</font>

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,500
that I know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our work he knows far</font>

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,180
far more and I have a suspicion that

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:48,410
some of you may wish to dive into the

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:54,800
weeds far deeper than I wish to go most

29
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:58,870
of my work in DC is as a part of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> push</font>

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,870
this once or

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,700
and you can see I just go next to

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,109
technology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it breaks so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I work at</font>

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">a think tank called the New America</font>

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">there it's about 150 people and about 50</font>

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,220

37
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:24,170
Institute which I run and you have to

38
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:27,380
imagine a place DC is completely swarmed

39
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,089
it's overrun by lawyers and more

40
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,359
importantly it's overrun by lawyers that

41
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,920
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play technologists and so if</font>

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,100
you're wondering like why do they keep

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,010
making these crazy decisions in DC it's

44
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,010
because honestly most of the time they

45
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,090
have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what they're talking about</font>

46
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:50,060
when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to tech policy and so into</font>

47
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:54,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that space the open Technology Institute</font>

48
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:57,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">was created five years ago with a fairly</font>

49
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,650
simple plan which was to bring

50
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,400
technological acumen into discussions

51
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:08,110
we're all too<font color="#E5E5E5"> little of it existed you</font>

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,940
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> our mission statement there and</font>

53
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,709
so we have sort of the traditional

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">think-tank arm of our work this is sort</font>

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> juan curi these are the people</font>

56
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,540
making white papers and holding

00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:21,020
conveniens and working with people

inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beltway on developing policy</font>

59
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,470
these are the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going up</font>

60
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,920
onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hill and banging our heads up</font>

61
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,709
against various brick walls for fun but

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,470
also and unlike any other think tank in

63
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,930
this area<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a field operations arm</font>

64
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,820
and the field operations are more the

65
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,820
folks are out in community deploying

66
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:44,570
networks now the project we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:47,930
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> about today very much lies at the</font>

68
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:50,269
center of these two areas plus the tech

69

development the work that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-house</font>

70
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:57,769
to actually build open technologies of

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,359
various sorts and we have sort of two

72
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:03,920
big research development tech projects

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,950
one is called measurement lab which is

<font color="#E5E5E5">available measurement lab net this is a</font>

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,140
another network

other ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might collaborate</font>

85
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:44,450
because I see this all as a mechanism to

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,479
inform key policy makers with empirical

87
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,639

not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about measurement lab</font>

90
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,090
today because in fact what we're going

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about is commotion and</font>

92
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,609
commotion began in essence about 13

utter technical naivete I invited a

bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> local hackers and system</font>

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,940
administrators and super geeks while I

97
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,599
was looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in urbana champaign over for</font>

homebrew and pizza and thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,200
going to be a summer project to develop

some sort of distributed<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad hoc mesh</font>

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,810
system that we could all build over a

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,719
large geographic area well as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

project looking at it through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lens</font>

109
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,310
of how do we bring affordable

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay hi presentation tag-team style it's</font>

150
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:52,530
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back of a pickup truck and</font>

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think yeah so the commotion wireless</font>

152
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,989
project is something that we've been

153
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,379
that's based on a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work that we've</font>

154
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,509
been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for years in the community</font>

155
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,870
wireless networking and open source mesh

156
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,669
wireless networking space and sort of

157
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">building on a lot of the technologies</font>

158
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,990
that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of other</font>

developers on over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last few years</font>

160
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:23,460
and where I see the really valuable the

161
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:28,279
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable purpose of this</font>

162
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:31,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology is in being able to push a</font>

163
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:35,130
sort of education innovation about

164
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,450
network technology and into the hands of

165
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:44,039

169
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are a lot of really great examples</font>

170
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:02,220
of networks that are built kind of from

171
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,990
this grassroots level up like there's

172
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Athens wireless metropolitan network</font>

173
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,550

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,130
metropolitan Athens in the surrounding

175
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:16,430

179
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:29,510
obviously I got tired of drawing dots

180
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:35,250
and lines long before I got to 31,000

181

but why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see those sorts of</font>

182
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,399

to host their own local maps and

for an event or a protest or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

or in in Barcelona why don't we see

228
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,870
involved in that like the overall

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:49,290
technical complexity of building a

232
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,120
networks are based on Wi-Fi and other

00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,650
unlicensed wireless technology that

234
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,819
doesn't necessarily scale that well

235
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:04,179
beyond

236
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:05,978
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dozen nodes and most of</font>

237
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:08,919
these networks are built by people who

238
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:11,379
are I mean they're mostly built by a

239
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,299
bunch of german hackers who only use

240
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,129
command-line interfaces for anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

241
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:19,869
don't make any sort of interfaces that

00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:21,459
are very accessible to to make it

243
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:23,139
possible for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> community that's</font>

working to select new sites where we can

communities and new neighborhoods

322
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,399
internationally so that we can roll that

like that where network connectivity

gets shut off that infrastructure is

349
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,179
already in place and allows people to

that we've received is specifically

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:43,620
focused on what happens in say in Egypt

381
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,750
to where the main infrastructure the

it was possible in that kind of

environment to have communications in a

those kinds of use cases abroad and

400
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:35,370
of technologies are incredibly useful

for uh Keith Mitchell<font color="#E5E5E5"> ENSO art I think</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the objectives of your project are</font>

404
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,780
the progress on it I am however very

405
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,419
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your IP addressing</font>

406
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,908
architecture is my understanding correct

407
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,409
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are reusing address ipv4</font>

408
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:53,549
address space<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already been</font>

409
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:56,370
assigned elsewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet yeah</font>

410
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:59,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the case the but we're working</font>

411
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:02,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to change that so the reason for that is</font>

412
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,250
that at its outset when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font>

413
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,049
developing the firmware that would

414
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:13,679
become one part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commotion project</font>

415
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:15,299
was that we had a need from one of the

416
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,490
communities that we were working in to

417
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,840
be backwards compatible with an

418
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-source mesh routing firm were</font>

419
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,490
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Robin and that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing</font>

420
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,740
scheme that the Robin firmware used and

421
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,210
so that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up using not</font>

422
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing sorry the addressing</font>

423
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,850
scheme that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Robin firm were used and</font>

424
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,580
so that was what we ended up with as a

425
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,740
default my<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding is that the</font>

426
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,439
reasoning behind that on the part of the

427
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Robin community was that at some time</font>

428
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,080
those addresses may have been

429
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:50,020
you know sparsely utilized I don't know

430
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:54,250
if that's actually like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a valid</font>

431
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:57,430
reasoning but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we're</font>

432
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,980
actively working to change and it didn't

433
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:02,230
make it into our most recent release to

434
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,120
change that as the default addressing

435
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,480

454
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I wondered if you'd tell us like the</font>

455
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,170
examples in the European cities how are

456
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,830
they funded how do these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things come</font>

457
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,540
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh they actually come about in a</font>

458
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,760
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways depending on the</font>

459
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,129
network so it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

460
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,460
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different networks have</font>

461
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,690
extremely different models of

462
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:24,940
organization and extremely different

463
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:27,790
models of of funding as the organization

464
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,230
both from a standpoint of people and

465
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:33,149
from the standpoint of like how the

466
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:38,500
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself is managed for instance</font>

467
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:41,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network the Athens network is almost</font>

468
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,110
entirely completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad-hoc collective</font>

469
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,179
where individual participants all

470
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:49,139
purchase and own their own nodes and

471
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:53,800
it's there's a loose sort of like

472
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:56,190
Congress of no donors that that form

473
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,029
broad network policy but it's

474
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:03,840
largely unmanaged but there's sort of

475
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:05,759
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself sort of the ethic</font>

476
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,330
behind is to engender a strong sense of

477
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,909
personal responsibility behind that and

478
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,710
mostly any<font color="#CCCCCC"> uplinks that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network was</font>

479
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,659
actually founded<font color="#CCCCCC"> before there was a</font>

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,419
cheap available broadband access in

<font color="#CCCCCC">Athens so it was originally founded</font>

482
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:23,129
almost as entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a local network</font>

483
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:24,600
without any sort of dedicated source of

00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:27,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">uplink stand so that wasn't necessarily</font>

485
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,759
a requirement for their funding model to

486
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,340
fun up links to the internet now they do

487
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:36,539
have up Winx I understand mostly like

488
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,990
donated or they're funded through

489
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:45,480
donations but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other networks</font>

490
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:46,950
like one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't mention because</font>

491
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,539
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one city and so it would</font>

492
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,080
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like one big dot but</font>

493
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:54,929
there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> funk for a network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Vienna</font>

494
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,918
Austria has about 600 nodes that cover

495
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:00,899
most of downtown Vienna and a lot of the

496
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,990
surrounding neighborhoods and they

497
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:09,090
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a very tightly controlled</font>

498
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:11,279
and managed network that they they

499
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:14,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">manage through a close association they</font>

500
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:19,019
are whatever the Austrian equivalent of

501
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:20,610
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 501 C 3 is I believe and they fund the</font>

502
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,500
operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their network by running a</font>

503
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,719
micro colocation facility through their

504
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:29,450
main<font color="#CCCCCC"> fibre uplink and they are they're</font>

505
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:32,460
actually able to make enough through the

506
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,980
colocation fees to fund the upkeep and

507
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:39,000
operation of their network so they're

508
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:41,759
extremely varying sort of methods for

509
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,200
funding the networks and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

510
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,009
we have a strong focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on is just in</font>

511
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,480
trying to build a<font color="#CCCCCC"> toolkit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font>

512
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and documentation that's flexible enough</font>

513
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,690
that can support a lot of these

514
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,250
different organizing models because what

515
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,870
we find is that different models of

516
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:58,679
funding and organization and network

517
00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:01,830
management different models work better

518
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,870
in different communities and so we just

519
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to support as broad a</font>

520
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,100
swath i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that generally</font>

521
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:09,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">speaking you know hardware wise and</font>

522
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,270
operationally

523
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deploying one of these</font>

524
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,310
networks is probably significantly lower

525
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,970
than deploying like enterprise-class

526
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:25,260
gear and trenching fiber but it's I mean

527
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,270
there are trade-offs there too because

528
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:31,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have gigabit capacity</font>

529
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:33,620
generally speaking either but yeah so

530
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,879
different for different networks I guess

531
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,620
sure thanks and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a follow-up</font>

532
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">question to that you had like a next</font>

533
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,159
step slide that went into you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

534
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">were working on the software obviously</font>

535
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then looking at kind of pilot</font>

536
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,929
projects to develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> a summer with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

537
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,820
then the training where are you actually

538
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,980
out with that you have like other pilot

539
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,300
networks in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. that are doing this</font>

540
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,340
and are there people that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

541
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,340
trained and yeah where have you actually

542
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:59,820
gotten on that so we have pilot networks

543
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:04,830
in detroit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> brooklyn new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> york in</font>

545
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,610
other people who have started up small

546
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:12,780
networks just by downloading our

547
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:14,370
software off of the website they the

548
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,280
platform that's for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

549
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,649
is the routing firmware so it's in that

550
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,270
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of traditional community</font>

551
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:28,260
wireless network stuff like fry funk

552
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:33,120
stuff but so we have small<font color="#E5E5E5"> testbed</font>

553
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:35,730
networks to in Detroit to and DC and one

554
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,800
in Brooklyn that are all running our

555
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,010
software and are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being managed by</font>

community members in cooperation with us

557
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,790
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with them in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

558
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,260
build out the network's the digital

560
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:53,730
we're currently running that I can tell

00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like if we've actually completed the</font>

565
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,810
you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just touched on my question</font>

566
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,660
I understand that your technology helps

567
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,340
support the occupy DC movement are there

568
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,450
any successes or challenges around that

569
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:20,939
you can discuss definitely some

570
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:22,550
challenges one of the lot of the biggest

571
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,240
challenges there

572
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:28,070
were just practical deployment issues

573
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,560
and I was largely around the fact that

574
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:35,030
at that point I mean still the the

575
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,370
router base platform is kind of our

576
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,860
flagship platform and some of the other

577
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,590
platforms like the desktop clients and

578
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,270
Android and all of that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of aren't</font>

579
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> along in their development</font>

580
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:53,629
cycles but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that we deployed</font>

581
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:57,260
routers in like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we donated</font>

582
00:28:53,630 --> 00:29:00,230
routers to occupy DC but mostly the

583
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:05,360
problems there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just around</font>

584
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:07,640
electricity because we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

585
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,260
it was kind of a spontaneous thing and

586
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,660
we didn't have like batteries and solar

587
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,270
panels and they were you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know plugin p</font>

588
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:21,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">OE routers the burn watt power and they</font>

589
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:22,460
weren't really like designed to main

590
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,680
problem was that they were running it

591
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,450
off of a generator<font color="#E5E5E5"> that frequently went</font>

592
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,180
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they ran out of gas and so</font>

593
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,370
the network was just too unreliable for

594
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,500
them to really make use of but we got a

595
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,969
lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback and from people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

596
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,970
were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the network when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

597
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:45,020
up and it shows the need that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

598
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:47,270
since then we've focused more on both

599
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,510
the mobile clients and enhancing their

600
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:54,500
capabilities doing some upstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

601
00:29:50,510 --> 00:30:01,040
work to support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also focusing</font>

602
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:02,810
more on like power consumption on solar

603
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,560
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> battery powered hardware platforms</font>

604
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,560
things like that

605
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,540
