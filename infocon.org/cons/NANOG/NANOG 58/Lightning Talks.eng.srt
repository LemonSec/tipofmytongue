furthering the adoption in evolution of

00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,580
that that will help<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it has this</font>

tiered membership model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could be</font>

it you could be a platinum gold or

silver the Platinum members were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,419
ones that kind of booted this thing up

this is cisco brocade juniper ericsson

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,050
thing as I said it's to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

36
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,840
a source code base that people can use

00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to build product and other things on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,340
of I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of to boot up a</font>

39
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-source sdn ecosystem and we also</font>

40
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,420
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a you know we want to have</font>

41
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,158
a broad industry a kind of acceptance

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,140
around this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

43
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,000
the things is you know people we would

44
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,729
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a basis for product</font>

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,040
as well and then of course like any open

46
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,280
source project or community you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,040
have a great developer and technical

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,810
community around it and really can't it

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,489
really can't survive without that and

50
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,739
that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really true for any open</font>

51
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:30,260
source project and in fact there's a

52
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:31,610
daylight hackfest tomorrow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> friday in</font>

53
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">san jose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where they'll be about a</font>

54
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,019
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> people involved in that sort of</font>

55
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,269
a community building activity there and

56
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:42,680
then when I came into this and there

57
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,910
were there were questions about whether

58
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,260
or not it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to be open and</font>

59
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,060
transparent and all of this kind of

60
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,579
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the founders and all of</font>

61
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:53,000
the silica stuff and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just said look I</font>

62
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,320
i got elected board chair of the tsc the

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,489
technical steering committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font>

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,940
said hey look all of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff's going</font>

65
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be open so kind</font>

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,250
uniquely the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tsc calls are open to</font>

67
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,140
everyone they're recorded on the minutes

68
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,490
are posted publicly so there's a webex

69
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,950
you can just get on it and you can

70
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,360
listen or you can even talk so it's it's

71
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,190
unlike say the open networking

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,020
foundation or even the IETF where the

73
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,310
iesg has closed meetings it's

74
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,950
everything's open see what's the code

75
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,160
thing here all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the founding members</font>

76
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,149
have contributed some piece of

77
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,450
intellectual property in the form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

78
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,450
code so the cisco folks had it they

79
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,839
contributed a controller IBM<font color="#E5E5E5"> IBM has</font>

80
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,390
things like dove NEC has a virtual

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,160
network tenant application things like

82
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but the reality is it's an open</font>

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,090
source project so while these people

84
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,380
booted it up anybody can develop code

85
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,760
contribute code as an individual and

86
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,660
hopefully this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will form a robust</font>

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,310
framework and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there'll be new</font>

88
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,340
applications and tools that sit on top

89
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">of us because i think as most of us</font>

90
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">think anyway that the real action and</font>

91
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,020
all of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sdn stuff's going to be in</font>

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,950
applications not in the infrastructure

93
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of mundane in a way it's it's</font>

94
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,899
built under the EPL till eclipse public

95
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,580
license which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

96
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,180
vendors like because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can bundle up</font>

97
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,650
their own their own proprietary pieces

98
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,060
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their product so and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

99
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">show you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a second when we look</font>

100
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the architecture so here's a picture</font>

101
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,079
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so the the controller</font>

102
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,480
platform in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle is sort of the</font>

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,070
key piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> behind it</font>

104
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,560
is that it has a few architectural

105
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,130
features that are important one is that

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,990
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the self the interface is going south</font>

107
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,469
from it so it's listed there are things

108
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">like open flow and things like I to RS</font>

109
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,510
and there can be things other things

110
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">like net confer and the like but there</font>

111
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,610
can also be proprietary things like

112
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,370
cisco has one PKG no s<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdk things like</font>

113
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,780
that and it's all pluggable right so for

114
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,570
example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you could build a</font>

115
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,849
proprietary southbound because you have

116
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,380
some sdk and you could bundle it up if

117
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wanted to so that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

118
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,159
interesting features of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it another</font>

119
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,890
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> feature of it is this this</font>

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,470
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstraction layer now this thing</font>

121
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,969
is the idea here is that applications

122
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,449
that run on top of this thing shouldn't

123
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,180
have to

124
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:14,520
no what kind of self balance it's

125
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,870
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application is talking to it</font>

126
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,849
shouldn't have to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's</font>

127
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,249
so there's the idea here is that you

128
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,889
build an abstraction that would allow

129
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:25,229
you to kind of not only take advantage

130
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,839
of the unique features of the southbound

131
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:29,430
but also allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to sort of do this in</font>

132
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,629
a model-driven way so you wouldn't have

133
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:37,289
to have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a as application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

134
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:38,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API sweet / self ground and then</font>

135
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:43,159
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing on the northbound side</font>

136
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:45,839
pluggable model-driven northbound<font color="#CCCCCC"> API s</font>

137
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:48,240
so that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea behind it a</font>

138
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,580
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these pieces are around right now</font>

139
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a lot of the sack fest activity</font>

140
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:58,469
tomorrow will be around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the controller</font>

141
00:05:52,499 --> 00:06:01,219
piece of it if you want to play wikidot

142
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:04,589
opendaylight org has tons and tons of

143
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:06,240
information about what's there what's

144
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,249
planned what architectural features

145
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,969
there are how to how to get code how to

146
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:16,229
build it how to run it so wiki that

147
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">opened a like to our org mailing lists</font>

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,128
technical steering committee mailing

151
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">lists that's where we do all our all our</font>

subscribed they're all open let me just

156
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,998
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about governance for a second again</font>

157
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,399
this was when this got booted up this

158
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:43,379
governance thing was very very

159
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,969
contentious and I just put a pointer to

160
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,449
the bylaws which are just standard

161
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source bylaws</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the consortium</font>

162
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,020
has a board of directors just like any

163
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,599
other open source project that you know

164
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,810
deals with business basically and hard

165
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,669
decisions it's initially comprised of

166
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Platinum members plus one of the</font>

167
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,370
gold<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the silver it's kind of</font>

168
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,539
standard thing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the things</font>

169
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really nice about having the</font>

170
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,409
Linux Foundation they've done this 100

171
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,609
times they know how to do it then

172
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a technical steering committee</font>

173
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,899
and basically did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this is where</font>

174
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:15,899
the technical decisions get made if they

175
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,579
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and it's also it's also where</font>

176
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:21,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">release trains and those things get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

177
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:22,289
find now in in a regular open sorcerer

178
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amateur</font>

179
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,919
the source project what you'd really

180
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,499
want to have is the technical steering

181
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,969
committee be comprised of that you know

182
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:33,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technical people from the main</font>

183
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:36,080
projects but since we had it since we

184
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,939
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot the thing it's currently</font>

185
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,068
comprised of members that have been

186
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,360
assigned by the Platinum members so I

187
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">became</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the chair of the technical</font>

188
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,559
steering committee but I don't expect

189
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">that after a year or however long I term</font>

190
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:51,119
is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would still be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font>

191
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,008
again as I said that the the

192
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:54,869
well-functioning technical steering

193
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:59,639
committee will have lead developers from

194
00:07:54,869 --> 00:08:01,649
the core projects see what else oh yeah

195
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,300
and of course you know we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

196
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,439
this thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of membership and</font>

197
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,619
all of that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open to anybody</font>

198
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,149
it's open source project so anyone can

199
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:11,939
develop and contribute code anybody can

200
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:14,249
get code anybody can get elected to the

201
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">tsc anybody can get elected to the board</font>

202
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:19,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">and anyone can you know help steer a</font>

203
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:24,529
project in any number of ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

204
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:26,849
in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other open source project uh</font>

205
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,899
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the chair of the tsc I just</font>

206
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,719
thought I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that just a</font>

207
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,250
little more on what we do is we set the

208
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,929
technical direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> in code train</font>

209
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,419
releases and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned the</font>

210
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:38,968
membership is kind of booted bootstrap

211
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,010
by the appointees from the Platinum

212
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,599
members but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important thing is that</font>

213
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,310
the meetings the mailing lists and the

214
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,790
calls are all open to anybody who wants

215
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to listen so if you get on wikidot</font>

216
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,360
wikidot opendaylight oregon go down to

217
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,810
where it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> tsc you can see the agenda</font>

218
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the end the call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information and the</font>

219
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,768
minutes are also there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's</font>

220
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:03,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">also a technical work stream call which</font>

221
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:05,220
is a technical call that where we handle

222
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:07,290
technical issues and that's currently on

223
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:12,019
I think it's on Mondays but there's the

224
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,019
URL for it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it</font>

225
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,410
ok any questions

226
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:33,610
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> other architecture diagram which</font>

227
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:37,630
one OOP sorry Randy bush i J um how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

228
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,250
of those are colored in already um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

229
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,589
that's a really great question so the

230
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,290
middle controller box is and a lot of

231
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:46,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">pieces of it for southbounds right now</font>

232
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,630
there's an open flow there are two

233
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:51,730
different open flow 10 southbounds

234
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,920
there's some work going on and on sort

235
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,220
of a proto I to RS thing there's a net

236
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,269
cough one northbound um there's there

237
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,220
exists a couple of different proposals

238
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,690
for what the you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the model</font>

239
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,370
driven approach to the northbound was

240
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,930
see the main reason that it's all model

241
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,399
driven is because who knows what this

242
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,079
stuff is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like and rather</font>

243
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,269
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hand it a yang model and then</font>

244
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:18,430
generate that right we historically been

245
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:20,350
so good at network models um yang yeah I

246
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,439
am I mean we could come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a long</font>

247
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:27,070
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fails ones yeah um well well</font>

248
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,320
taken and<font color="#E5E5E5"> openstack you know had the</font>

249
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,320
bootstrap start of being handed a lot of

250
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,970
code by<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA yeah and and so I'm just</font>

251
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of wondering how much of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

252
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,690
real all there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of code there's</font>

253
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,529
there's a lot not but I don't want to

254
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave you with the impression that</font>

255
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,779
there's anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a completely ready</font>

256
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,610
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> working system it's more like</font>

257
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:46,839
here's a developer system and you know

258
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,000
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start working on this so</font>

259
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of code available but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

260
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,360
in production or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumable state by</font>

261
00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:00,899
anybody but developers right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

262
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,899
Dave thanks very much

263
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,370
alrighty next up we have Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> bush</font>

264
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:14,579
speaking on the suitability of ping to

265
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:24,090
measure latency so now you get the

266
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:27,540
traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> comic sans and the clicker</font>

267
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:34,410
is Dave did you just walk off with the

268
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:39,380
clicker it sounds off of that it's on

269
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:46,699
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it is yeah</font>

270
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:51,960
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything so um</font>

271
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:54,270
this is research I guess this bleeding

272
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,910
right arrow is this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um we were using</font>

273
00:11:54,270 --> 00:12:00,000
the Atlas probe system to do some

274
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:05,160
experiments and we found a very high

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,110
variance in ping times in other words we

276
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,600
ping something and it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a hundred</font>

277
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,180
milliseconds but the variance in that

278
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,250
hundred milliseconds would be

279
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,219
unexpectedly high so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we started to</font>

280
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,810
wonder what's the actual distribution

281
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,450
could there be a rich distribution in

282
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:24,689
other words hey lots of variance in the

283
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,060
ping times and not flat so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decided</font>

284
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,990
maybe before using these tools we better

285
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,579
calibrate them I know that's radical but

286
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:37,740
there's some cute thing called Paris

287
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:42,000
trace route which uses flow ID to

288
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:45,330
explore through hashing through forcing

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,400
the hashes on the routers to force it to

290
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:54,360
explore ecmp or leg alternate pads and

291
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,670
what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by flow ID is and it's the</font>

292
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,640
dark stuff up there I wonder what this

293
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:03,569
ah yes sorry about that so these dark

294
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:08,310
things control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hash that the router</font>

295
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:11,240
is going to use this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> UDP ping this is</font>

296
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:17,010
ICMP and the port unreachable response

297
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,120
so you we could change those and cause

298
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,089
the router to

299
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:29,640
choose the alternate pads it had<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

300
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:31,800
eat ecmp and<font color="#CCCCCC"> four leg so we ran these</font>

301
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,960
week you'll remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked on nanog</font>

302
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,290
for some help we're an experiment and

303
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,839
experiment take 8-10 hours do hundreds

304
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:43,140
of pings just over to one destination

305
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,960
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> across all these to get a fairly</font>

306
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,600
high reliable number this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what it</font>

307
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:55,350
looks like here's roma tre<font color="#E5E5E5"> University in</font>

308
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:58,650
Rome to ashburn and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux it's wonderful</font>

309
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Linux rounds the ping result it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believes</font>

310
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,510
that ping cannot have any resolution

311
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:08,220
better than three digits so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see</font>

312
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:10,200
the red do this but these curves are the

313
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,950
actual ping results and you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

314
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,400
distribution of these curves so a single

315
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:20,010
ping while altering the flow had

316
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,560
significant variance not big variants

317
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,170
but significant in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case and so we</font>

318
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,150
went to explore why and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we</font>

319
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">found it was ecmp a global provider</font>

320
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:35,069
getting across the Atlantic with many

321
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,680
pads when you take those and you

322
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:41,040
multiply them you get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

323
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,400
alternatives and it looks really<font color="#CCCCCC"> ugly if</font>

324
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,730
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do science across this</font>

325
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:50,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we then said let's simplify</font>

326
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,050
things down let's get it down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

327
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,730
something we can actually get some feel

328
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,410
for so we have a host in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dallas and it's</font>

329
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:03,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected to a router that's connected</font>

330
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:10,620
to a router this is ace<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine times 10</font>

331
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:13,770
gig path lagged<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we know the</font>

332
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,890
configurations and circuits and details

333
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:22,920
on all these routers and then there's

334
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:27,120
one in ashburn<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we ran the you</font>

335
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:31,620
know source ID variant ping between

336
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:36,360
these just over this path the

337
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:42,120
result is the worst case we found the

338
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:46,370
Varick the variance is very high the

339
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:50,490
minimal ping time was 32 33 milliseconds

340
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:52,950
the maximal who was 46 that says the

341
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:57,270
variance is over fifty percent of the

342
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:58,560
men<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and these are clear bands now</font>

343
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,640
what you've gotten the red and the black

344
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">going up there is the red is what you</font>

345
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,760
got this is the CDF if you actually ran

346
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,339
ping at CDF of measured ping the black

347
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:17,460
is if we assumed all these alternate

348
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:20,000
paths had equal probability what would

349
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,440
you get and notice it looks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

350
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and the difference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is of course it</font>

351
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,310
doesn't distribute over the equal

352
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:30,300
probability but something is really

353
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:33,569
kinky here something is really kinky

354
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,579
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this calls into question aside from</font>

355
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,370
you're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun in operations</font>

356
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:42,980
is there's a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of research based</font>

357
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:48,630
on using ping to measure latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> bye-bye</font>

358
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:51,680
okay so we switched don't have a magic

359
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:55,170
answer don't hope we're still digging

360
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,750
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm traveling some of the digs we</font>

361
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:03,630
did it's not the host we measured across

362
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:05,730
here the looks dull and normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

363
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:10,770
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the host it's not the simple</font>

364
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:14,069

365
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:18,209
very reproducible the circuit loading

366
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:21,059
was less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty percent aggregate we</font>

367
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:25,170
do not know that the loading on a single

368
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:28,500
circuit in the lag was not really bad

369
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,450
and that's because we've not<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able</font>

370
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,170
and this is where the router vendor help

371
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,910
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to actually find and monitor</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">variance itself varies but I mean that's</font>

that worst case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

percent or ugly when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at it from</font>

408
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,480
researcher point of view ops they may

409
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,130
not but make that much difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

410
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,340
and we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large number of</font>

411
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,810
measurements but the Atlas probe itself

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:43,649
is a imprecisely there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety three</font>

generations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all different and</font>

414
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:50,590
see the deeper we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the Atlas</font>

415
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,570
probes the more bugs were finding we in

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,730
those measurements that we used an atlas

417

<font color="#CCCCCC">Lee data at the top that we couldn't</font>

figure out we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and looked we</font>

421
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,399
were having some delays in other words

422
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,560
we sent that packet out in the Atlas

423

<font color="#CCCCCC">half minutes later I kind of don't</font>

425
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,390
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I think there's a</font>

426
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:21,180
little buggy pues hiding there in

428
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:28,780
so when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measuring latency</font>

429
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,870
you may want to do a little more in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:41,409
from that ping is min<font color="#CCCCCC"> Max and mean but</font>

432
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,170
you don't know the dispersion the max

433
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,260
could have been one packet or all of

434
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:50,800
them are up there at the max Todd you're

435
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:55,890
heading<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a mic No ah come on somebody</font>

436
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:59,669
had for Mike you're boring audience I

437
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:04,540
won't invite you to speak next time

438
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:06,520
thanks Randy sure I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock that</font>

439
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:09,290
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

440
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:14,660
all right could I have taught<font color="#CCCCCC"> Underwood</font>

441
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:15,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">and john van up and up here please come</font>

442
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:22,970
on Todd you're big you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> move faster</font>

443
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:24,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all right this is a tragedy</font>

444
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,420
there's no coffee out there so this talk

445
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,620
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to totally suck let me just</font>

446
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,970
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now but there's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

447
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">in leaving because you know what there's</font>

448
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:35,390
no coffee out there um so John and I

449
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,879
were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this yesterday and we</font>

450
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,500
just decided slap this together there's

451
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,970
some big problems to be solved here and

452
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,830
we thought reviewing it quickly would

453
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,210
give us all a sense of where some really

454
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,379
interesting challenging work is to be

455
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,460
done this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be a little bit</font>

456
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,470
different than some of the stuff you've

457
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:54,560
looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah yay all right so let me</font>

458
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce the problem so it's too slow</font>

459
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,850
like stuff slow and it's slow in

460
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,710
particular in the history of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

461
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,909
there's these data a used to be back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

462
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,400
two thousand one there was this very

463
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,230
famous 28 seconds people give up paying

464
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,210
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> after eight seconds more</font>

465
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,770
recently the average is 4 seconds and

466
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,880
Google's got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence that most of</font>

467
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped paying attention after</font>

468
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,380
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a thousand</font>

469
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,210
milliseconds really uh no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

470
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,770
done right you guys already stopped

471
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,300
paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to me before I even</font>

472
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,480
started talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is like</font>

473
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,159
fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> right um so users get</font>

474
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">distracting leave we are network</font>

475
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,340
engineers so we spend all our time

476
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,840
optimizing the network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're sort of</font>

477
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,760
looking at it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like is the network</font>

478
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,040
really the problem is that like we're

479
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,330
just pounding<font color="#E5E5E5"> this network hammer um so</font>

480
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,430
we wanted to review what's really

481
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,080
contributing to end user latency stack

482
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,890
rank them and look at solving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

483
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,889
serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems</font>

484
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,610
sorry you ought to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay anyway the</font>

485
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,649
real contributions to latency some of

486
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,479
this came out in our discussion with

487
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,679
ourselves as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done some</font>

488
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,659
testing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our residential networking</font>

489
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,000
was just terrified at some of the cpes

490
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:01,610
that our users had been trying to use on

491
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,230
our hundred gig service at home so

492
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,549
obviously you have network design that's

493
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,350
what we all talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

494
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,150
our discussions can we route this<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

495
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,129
on the backbone what can be done the cpe

496
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,650
thing though that's pretty big last mile

497
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:15,440
networks tend to be well ugly a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

498
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:18,500
the time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing and bad</font>

499
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,270
geolocation you know that happens then

500
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,919
of course you see the websites that wow

501
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,600
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> local if I do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traceroute but</font>

502
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,020
it still took three seconds to serve

503
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,260
that's odd people didn't on poor quality

504
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,090
servers things like that and then of

505
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,070
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fire propagation delay and</font>

506
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:38,209
that comes right into our last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

507
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:40,340
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> see we'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that later there</font>

508
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,490
are some anomalous to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reducing network</font>

509
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,289
in delay in the network itself this is a

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,230
map of<font color="#CCCCCC"> some microwave networks have been</font>

511
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:50,658
built between Chicago and New York for

512
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,280
high-speed trading because the

<font color="#E5E5E5">energy in the air is a lot lower than</font>

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty-five percent or so which is quite</font>

517
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,390
interesting but this is where you come

518
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">around to money can solve lots of</font>

problems except see at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment but</font>

520
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,610
you can get closer to see at low

521

527
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,640
decided to divide the latency into the

528
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:28,010
cost of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route and realized that it</font>

529
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,809
was 80 million bucks per per millisecond

530
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:33,049
that was saved across the Atlantic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

531
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:34,668
well is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth it I mean is there</font>

536
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,240
it are there any more things we can fix

537
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:49,460
well the big solution here cpe we've got

538

one ask one big problem interleaving

539

error correction i was sitting there

540
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,960
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of our other engineers</font>

80 milliseconds to our 10 gige port

545
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,010
sometimes 40 milliseconds most of the

correction on these these lines it's

550
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,850
that really necessary that bad well we

551
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,370
didn't leave out on the cpe buffering

552

I was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on a connection or</font>

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,930
latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my testing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is about 15</font>

we all know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bad what can we do</font>

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if that's going to happen but</font>

564
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,680
I think that's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that's</font>

fix bad geolocation we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

572
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,760
do that look like geolocation is really

573
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,280
hard it's messy some people do it well

574
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,690
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't it mostly works most</font>

575
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,920
of the time it'd be awesome if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all</font>

576
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,390
worked perfectly all the time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

577
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">not that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big of a problem we wrote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

578
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:12,690
off not fixing this one geo locations

579
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:14,909
hard let's go shopping<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

580
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,770
fix these web technologies your web<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

581
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,630
dot whatever site kind of sucks it's

582
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,730
badly implemented people didn't take it

583
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,610
seriously so the solution is don't do

584
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:26,610
that related solution by a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ram</font>

585
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,860
further related solution don't use ram

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,149
as a capacity cash<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll explain that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

587
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,409
people who haven't thought about cold

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,440
starting their application at some other

589
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">time a related related solution don't</font>

590
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,240
use leaky or bad virtual memory machine

591
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,500
virtual machines like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ruby is a fine</font>

592

594
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:47,970
language don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the Ruby VM it's</font>

terrible run<font color="#CCCCCC"> JRuby anyway moving on the</font>

596
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:53,820
real moral here is that many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

treat web application is the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,689
do after you're done building everything

00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">else and the higher the stupidest least</font>

600
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,440
experienced people to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

601
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,660
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they throw</font>

602

thousands of milliseconds of any loser

603
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,870
latency so don't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

604
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,199
big opportunities there and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

605
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,699
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was awesome aha</font>

606
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then you know of course I</font>

607
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,220
started nerdy out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we were</font>

608
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,899
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the fiber side and I'm</font>

609
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,370
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the standard in this</font>

610
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,989
refraction on this fiber can we do

611
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,340
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and then well I</font>

612
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,080
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this paper this reference here at</font>

613
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom but you know there are these</font>

614
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,129
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been making fiber that</font>

615

616
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,279
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty terrible but the</font>

617
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,590
propagation speed is like ninety-eight

618
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,570
percent of the speed of<font color="#CCCCCC"> light</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

619
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,279
vacuum which really is a big that would

620
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,220
be an extra fraction of just over one

621
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:39,139
and that makes a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference but you</font>

622
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,730
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really how how much can we do in</font>

623
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:42,709
optimizing the typical fiber types well

624
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,480
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting there with that new york</font>

625
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:49,639
to london thing is my thought you know

626
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:52,580
SMF 28 about 1.4<font color="#E5E5E5"> 68 index refraction you</font>

627
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:55,639
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using 300,000 kilometers a second</font>

628
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,100
as the speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> light yeah fifty four</font>

629
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:59,689
milliseconds if you multiply<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in you</font>

630
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,860
know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that a little bit better</font>

631
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,480
we don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much of a difference</font>

632
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,439
we knock female seconds off here and

633
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,889
there is there something we can actually

634
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,299
do yeah maybe some types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fiber get</font>

635
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:10,939
you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better but most don't</font>

636
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:12,500
make much difference without other

637
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,149
problems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know putting a vacuum</font>

638
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,190
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fiber having lost that's</font>

639
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:20,000
completely ridiculous a three or four DB

640
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:22,370
per kilometer where's this get us what

641
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,929
are the things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do well you know</font>

642
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,149
we're starting with long and user delays

643
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:29,059
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix networks well that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

644
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:30,439
much fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpsa that's even more fixed</font>

645
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:33,320
you location I don't know if we can

646
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually fix that fixed web apps ooh</font>

647
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,580
that's definitely the biggest improved

648
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,230
propagation delay well you know we can

649
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a little bit better not much may be</font>

650
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:47,179
ending<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet some user delay improvements</font>

651
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,679
but can we do even better than this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

652
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:50,179
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we say like we</font>

653
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">just haven't been thinking big enough so</font>

654
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:58,010
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end user latency it's</font>

655
00:28:53,090 --> 00:29:00,019
the client latency the the network

656
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,610
latency so which we can decompose into

657
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:03,590
specific edge latency because that has

658
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,879
particular characteristics and the rest

659
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,250
of the network latency and some server

660
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,630
latency the client latency you can't do

661
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,130
much about other than ask people to buy

662
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,889
better computers you can do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

663
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,179
with how you deploy your web app and the

664
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:15,649
server latency would think is a big

665
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:17,570
opportunity but there's this network

666
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:19,820
latency we're spending time doing

667
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,860
relatively expensive fairly fiddly

668
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,030
things like optimizing paths and doing

669
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,129
traffic engineering I mean

670
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,480
raz gave this long presentation about oh

671
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,830
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna pick good paths and</font>

672
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,940
sometimes they'll have less good latency

673
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,710
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle all the</font>

674
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,800
traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really complicated so that's</font>

675
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine but the latency is bounded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

676
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:40,490
the factor of propagation delay

677
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">propagation delay inside of glass and</font>

678
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,590
the speed of<font color="#CCCCCC"> light see so you we looked</font>

679
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,150
at fixing the propagation<font color="#CCCCCC"> delay what we</font>

680
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,740
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the big opportunity here is</font>

681
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:50,840
people really haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

682
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,560
at increasing see when you look at the

683
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">math I think that the math I mean like</font>

684
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,190
look this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a time lightning talks are</font>

685
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,550
speculative work<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the time for</font>

686
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:04,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Big Ideas not be time to be timid like</font>

687
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:07,070
them the math is once you fix the dumb

688
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,960
web applications you fix a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font>

689
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,580
the edge your next big opportunity is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

690
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,560
fix see so these other stuff matters but

691
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:18,679
let me point this out that if we fix see

692
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,320
it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes everything about how</font>

693
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,480
we build networks everything about the

694
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,980
internet changes so what changes right

695
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,260
right now we build things out based on

696
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,690
cost and cost is usually a factor of a

697
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,770
combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of space and power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> costs we</font>

698
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,800
heard a lot about that at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

699
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,780
center at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data center gathering</font>

700
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,340

701
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,830
connectivity where can we get the right

702
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,720
kinds of good connectivity the<font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font>

703
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">is often based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user latency and</font>

704
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,000
end-user latency is dominated by see

705
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,370
like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this other stuff into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wash</font>

706
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,720
we've got some geopolitical factors like

707
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,669
don't put your data centers and places

708
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,260
I've ridiculous taxes or like are going

709
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,750
to be confiscated by you know bad

710
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:59,780
governments or whatever but like if we

711

can remove location as a constraint for

712
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,379
where we build data centers you know we

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have time left in the lightning</font>

encouraging the audience there's no one

716
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,120
that I know of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending significant</font>

717
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,429
amount of time and money working on this

718
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,020
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's I mean I don't think it</font>

719
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">over States is to say this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

720
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,490
biggest opportunity that is presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

721
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,980
our community this is the biggest

horizon available for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet today</font>

723
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,260
let's increase see thank you very much

724
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:38,209
I think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our question if</font>

725
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:40,129
anybody is foolish you know Oh majdi as

726
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:42,429
an alternative to increasing see have

727
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:48,619
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered developing time travel uh</font>

728
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:54,070
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe i equals B hey um I can't</font>

729
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:56,208
comment on release products really

730
00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:00,619
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of increasing see can we just</font>

731
00:31:56,209 --> 00:32:04,940
use D has some poor handling of data

732
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:06,529
structure oh wait I'm sorry hey I'm so

733
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,759
the approach we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken at comcast</font>

734
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:09,499
was we were considering doing

735
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">superconductivity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the cable plan</font>

736
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:12,649
you're talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end you are</font>

737
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,839
smart delays the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

738
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:16,129
just speed up the electrons yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

739
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,139
he's kind of a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of idea the</font>

740
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:19,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you were going but we were investing</font>

741
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:22,579
in liquid nitrogen not speeding up time

742
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:24,049
I feel like all the solutions here are

743
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:25,579
speeding up time liquid nitrogen or

744
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:28,339
vacuums<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean all those things sound</font>

745
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:31,039
great well there's I will point out that

746
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:33,289
like the depending on how well we can

747
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,450
develop like what rate at which we can

748
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:38,539
propagate entangled particles there are

749
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,789
some non speeding up time approaches to

750
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,559
this there's early work that I'm not

751
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:44,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">really prepared to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> publicize related to</font>

752
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,789
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway that if you can</font>

753
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:48,859
distribute a large number of entangled

754
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:51,320
particles there's some evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

755
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:53,599
may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to instantaneously or super</font>

756
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,549
instantaneously transmit information and

757
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,139
I do have a business methods patent on

758
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:58,429
the phrase super instantaneously by the

759
00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:01,189
way so please see me if you'd like to

760
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">use that Brandon it's a little yeah yeah</font>

761
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,209
I previous comments I'm also

762
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,708
disappointed you didn't explore the

763
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:11,169
possibility of all is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just moving closer</font>

764
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:11,169
back together and recreating Pangaea

765
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you know we did we didn't have this</font>

discussion about you know boring through

software by Google Todd you started to

leak some of the information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

research are doing on packet

<font color="#CCCCCC">little upset but you may not have been</font>

addressing methodologies from a previous

nanog so we can have a truly truly

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,500
quantum Internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that that's</font>

782
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,949
fantastic to know Joe I didn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,960
step on any unannounced work it may be

784
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,010
that these ideas are so obvious to so

785
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,300
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a lot of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">different people approaching it and</font>

00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:04,430
that's that's fantastic great any other
