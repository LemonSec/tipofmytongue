1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:08,099
okay so we're gonna go a slightly

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,389
whimsical here and talk about something

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a little bar in the work life</font>

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,928
situation for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so I</font>

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,088
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> work from home for a</font>

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,000
significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time a decent</font>

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of my team does as well recently</font>

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,750
there was a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dust-up in the news</font>

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,210
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the companies he's actually</font>

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,948
usually well represented here changing

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,710
their work from home policy and mr.

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,079
Underwood and dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prairie here decided</font>

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,420
that they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explore how they</font>

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:42,059
felt that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in the industry in</font>

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,750
general and so Todd you know has a lot

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,610
of experience here Beth<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,440
gynecologist and so you'll find that

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not be directly relevant here</font>

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,170
if any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do need a gynecologist</font>

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,699
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly recommend her if I'd</font>

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,100
like to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I ever needed a</font>

22
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,160
gynecologist I would call Beth

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,369
thankfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think i will need one</font>

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,649
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> todd is an SRE which in this case</font>

25
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:17,729
will stand force and removal engineer at

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:20,070
Google so Todd and Beth technology are

27
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,689
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yes yes thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much for</font>

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,250
that great introduction pumpkin we

29
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,508
really appreciate it we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to be</font>

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:31,040
here today excellent so um what was the

31
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,040
company that you were referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to oh</font>

32
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,070
well have to get into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a second</font>

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,320
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh we wanted to take a look at a</font>

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,119
touchy subject this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,889
way that claiming that not everybody has

36
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,780
to travel business class all the time is

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,490
touchy because people who really want to

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,350
do the thing they want to do feel

39
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">put-upon when you tell them what works</font>

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,740
about it and what doesn't but in

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,790
particular we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at what we</font>

42
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,829
actually know about how this stuff works

43
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,310
and specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to figure out</font>

44
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,070
under what circumstances it works for us

45
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:07,049
here geeks and technologies

46
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,369
technologists as workers but also for

47
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,050
the infrastructures and the systems that

48
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,670
we build so once your new some

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,560
terminology will try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> convince you you</font>

50
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,970
care if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we fail to succeed</font>

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,380
we convince you you care to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

52
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,640
break early there's probably coffee and

53
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,530
they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending out the food early</font>

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,149
so feel free to wander out we don't

55
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">really need you anyway we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk here</font>

56
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,099
without you you guys are entirely

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,750
superfluous we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about our biases</font>

58
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,149
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what we know about</font>

59
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,069
remote work and what we don't know in a

60
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,989
few counterintuitive things will try to

61
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,660
do a brief survey of what a bunch of

62
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,690
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and then we'll look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

63
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,359
strategies for making remote work

64
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,609
successful so just to go over the

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,110
terminology really quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so work from</font>

66
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,940
work is what we all know you have an

67
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,100
office desks and if you're really lucky

68
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,290
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a coffee machine working from</font>

69
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,329
home is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> two cases you can be</font>

70
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,730
local with the same city same time zone

71
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,980
same country as your team or you can be

72
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,929
remote in a different place then there's

73
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,750
work from remote which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working from a</font>

74
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,580
different office of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same company but</font>

75
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,610
remote from wherever your primary team

76
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,560
is distributed teams are where there's

77
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,480
no office for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> primary team at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,790
everybody's either working<font color="#E5E5E5"> from home or</font>

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,530
working from<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote the really important</font>

80
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,070
thing to remember especially when we

81
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,079
talk about the data in this is that

82
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:26,130
people don't differentiate well between

83
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:30,780
work from home remote distributed teams

84
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,700
and everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when we talk</font>

85
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all that people</font>

86
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">really mean when they are presenting</font>

87
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,329
data writing papers doing research is

88
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,180
either you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an office or you're</font>

89
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,190
something else and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

90
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,170
important as we look at these cases

91
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,769
because you lot are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

92
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,018
distinguish but ah my team is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

93
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,130
following way the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't distinguish</font>

94
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font>

95
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find is that the data are less good</font>

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
than we wish they were so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

97
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,959
care the main reason you care is that

98
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was recent contrived media</font>

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,340
controversy or controversy for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brits</font>

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,750
among you that's probably actually the

101
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,239
only reason you all care but why you

102
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,950
should care is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart people want to</font>

103
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,069
work wherever the hell they live right

104
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,500
people like being productive companies

105
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">like smart people who work for them to</font>

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work done and be cheap</font>

107
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,510
right and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are cheaper in Detroit</font>

108
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,960
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in santa clara and this or</font>

in jersey city knows

110
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,859
a little bit more expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> than Detroit</font>

111
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,960
okay that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and this impacts</font>

112
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,130
technology workers primarily a lot of

113
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,198
the research on this is about

114
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">salespeople</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is about call center but</font>

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,699
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically trying to look</font>

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology workers and the other</font>

117
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason you guys cares that the</font>

infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> for work from home has</font>

119
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,940
been changing pretty substantially you

120
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:52,000
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are like IRC</font>

121
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,650
aim and a phone call and now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,440
there's virtual meetings there's

123
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,239
gotomeeting there's virtual desktop

124
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,889
sharing and presentation sharing some

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,020
people use google hangouts or skype

126
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:03,340
right and the bandwidth requirements

127
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,580
keep going up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology</font>

128
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,770
requirements keep going up so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

129
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,409
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about our backgrounds so that you</font>

130
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,270
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> our biases one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons I</font>

131
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,190
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave and the program committee</font>

132
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,690
were happy to have me involved in this

133
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,110
is because I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sides of this</font>

134
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,759
so when we lived in New Hampshire I was

135
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,030
chief technology officer of a new

136
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,590
mexico-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP so on the like systems</font>

137
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,869
and network engineering side that was

138
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,780
awesome because IRC and that's fine

139
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,789
right on the executive management

140
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,270
business and product management side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

141
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:39,099
it it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> downright abysmal like people</font>

142
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,020
are like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you not know we were</font>

143
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna sell that product line to this</font>

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:48,070
hallway of two weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago like that's</font>

146
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:52,570
fantastic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part was mediocre</font>

147
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:56,050
overall at Renesys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

148
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,090
six years the most of the team was

149
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,190
distributed so although the headquarters

150
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,900
was in New Hampshire the teams<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,150
work with the systems engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

152
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,859
the network engineering teams were in I

153
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,359
don't know five countries and nine

154
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,960
cities or something and it was fine

155
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,050
right because IRC again because I RC but

156
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,729
the executive management saw again was

157
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,979
fine when I was local when I moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

158
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,960
Pittsburgh it worked less well Google is

159
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">a very very different circumstance and</font>

160
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,359
it's been widely reported google has an

161
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,490
almost universal work from work practice

162
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,590
that's not the policy but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice</font>

163
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">is almost everybody works in the office</font>

164
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,020
almost all the time but really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

165
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,490
great offices some people have crappy

166
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,159
commutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

167
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,780
them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live in a sensible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City</font>

168
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,900
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> too could live in a sensible</font>

169
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,349
city so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Joe's cranky sorry</font>

170
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:51,520
yeah I make Boston suck it's not my

171
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:53,889
fault oh um or California so so that

172
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,349
works that works pretty well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

173
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,780
obviously has some downsides I'm back on

174
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other hand has noted that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gynecology</font>

175
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,400
is not particularly amenable to remote

176
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,740
work it's not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me why that's the</font>

177
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,448
case but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carnegie Mellon has some good</font>

178
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,340
robotics engineers working on pieces of

179
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it I'm not kidding</font>

180
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,810
like the remote surgery stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

181
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be amazing because they start with</font>

182
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,310
like the surgeons in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjacent room</font>

183
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,710
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the surgeons in the</font>

184
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">adjacent time zone not terribly far from</font>

185
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,650
now there's some latency things that i'm

186
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on a lightning talk for this</font>

187
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,299
afternoon we'll talk about the latency

188
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,679
impacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that so um the research stuff</font>

189
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,569
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beth does a bunch of research I'm</font>

190
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,400
like research it's about reading things

191
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,380
and thinking and writing that can be

192
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,909
done anywhere right there's all these

193
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,740
pieces of paper and they're all like we

194
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:40,449
have these pieces of paper we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

195
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,070
with our paper it's in a place in a

196
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,570
drawer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we open it up and take things</font>

197
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,550
out of it it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird but anyway</font>

198
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,199
that apparently is not amenable to

199
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,280
remote work as well I'm confused as to

200
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,449
why so here are just some sort of images

201
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,190
for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about when you think</font>

202
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,169
about what people's work environments

203
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,139
look like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my work from home</font>

204
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,780
research environment um you can see I'm

205
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,099
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> my castle there are some boxes</font>

206
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,559
there that are full of my pieces of

207
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,330
paper to which I'm very attached and I

208
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,979
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a simple little desk not a lot</font>

209
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,419
of distraction there's an elliptical

210
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:13,090
machine I have a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> few of the trees</font>

211
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,620
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my windows the key element here</font>

212
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,650
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the castle in you too could have a</font>

213
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,509
castle at your work environment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

214
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,948
castle<font color="#CCCCCC"> does not come decorated you need</font>

215
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,330
children<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decorate it for you but</font>

216
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,300
those can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> rent we can provide those</font>

217
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,008
yes indeed so working<font color="#E5E5E5"> from work gets</font>

218
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,110
productive right it's great this is my

219
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:30,789
work from work environment I walk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

220
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,709
treadmill because why wouldn't you work

221
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,929
on a treadmill I need to wear headphones

222
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:37,059
because I need to defend myself against

223
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,529
my co-workers conversations I need to

224
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,299
wear eye protection because I need to

225
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,250
defend myself against my co-workers nerf

226
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,958
guns to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair I did buy them those</font>

227
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,540
nerf guns so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to complain</font>

228
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,130
too much there's hand sanitizer there to

229
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,300
defend myself against my<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-workers</font>

230
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,880
viruses and other

231
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:56,649
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jews and a towel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of course</font>

232
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the towel so so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it that we know</font>

233
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:00,670
or think we know now that we've sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

234
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,829
covered the terminology and some of the

235
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">background I'm what we really wanted to</font>

236
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">do with this talk was give a summary of</font>

237
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data of what is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> known about</font>

238
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,250
the conditions of working from home as

239
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,689
opposed to working from work and I'll

240
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,000
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you right now that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the take home</font>

241
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,100
from this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the data are thin on</font>

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,930
the ground and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them are</font>

243
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,730
methodologically flawed and so we don't

244
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,550
know as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as actually to be honest we</font>

245
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,950
ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we begin to really have</font>

246
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,140
work forces that want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work from home</font>

247
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,610
so what we do know is that everyone

248
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,160
wants the holy grail for an employee

249
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,019
fast cheap and happy everybody wants the

250
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,750
great employer who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> high paying with</font>

251
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,550
low friction and good work-life balance

252
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,890
so business schools corporations who are

253
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,390
employers and social science researchers

254
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,029
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been attempting to determine the</font>

255
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,589
methods for achieving this holy grail

256
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:49,300
but as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said please bear in mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

257
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:53,380
the research is not at the level you

258
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,270
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hope for so always start</font>

259
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,939
with the epidemiology which is who gets

260
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,699
the disease that you're worried about so

261
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,829
the definitions are a varying quality

262
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,480
nobody laughed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a joke I was</font>

263
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:08,430
like you just called my desired

264
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,820
lifestyle disease that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we roll I</font>

265
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,920
um so as we pointed out with the

266
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,020
problems even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the term work from</font>

267
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,449
home the definitions are problematic

268
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,640
when you look at who are the people who

269
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">are working from home as well so in the</font>

270
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,660
US the bureau of labor statistics the

271
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,209
most recent data they have on this is

272
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,069
from 2004 you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very recent your tax</font>

273
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:32,739
dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> at work ladies and gentlemen I'm</font>

274
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,570
fifteen percent of all non agricultural

275
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,690
workers in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. worked from home at</font>

276
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:41,020
least one day per week and that's flat

277
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,029
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2001 of the people who worked from</font>

278
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,649
home sixty-six percent were business

279
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,860
management or other professionals which

280
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,779
is you all not me and twenty-five

281
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,079
percent had a formal arrangement for

282
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:55,750
work from home in 2010 so the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> Census</font>

283
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,819
asks about this at every census but they

284
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,040
get coarser data and the finest data

285
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,760
that they have are those data from 2004

286
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,680
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 2010</font>

287
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,890
ten percent of people were work from

288
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,739
home in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EU the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most recent data or</font>

289
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,630
2005 so there you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year ahead and</font>

290
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,610
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven point five percent of</font>

291
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,560
their population worked from home at

292
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:20,270
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time so</font>

293
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:23,089
again hard to compare those exactly so

294
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:26,990
when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working from home what</font>

295
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:28,760
are they doing are they working so um

296
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,680
this is a survey this is

297
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,030
methodologically not a great survey but

298
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,650
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data about</font>

299
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it it's hard</font>

300
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,459
to get somebody to self-report

301
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,960
accurately what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually do so</font>

302
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">forty-three percent of people said that</font>

303
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,800
they watched TV or movies and twenty

304
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,390
percent played video games and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to</font>

305
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,800
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear if you were a parent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

306
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,330
children you were more likely to answer

307
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you did those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two things while you</font>

308
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,960
were working twenty-four percent of

309
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,180
people had a drink a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarter of them</font>

310
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,550
took a nap more than a quarter of them

311
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,660
did household chores and almost thirty

312
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:02,390
percent made dinner it's still probably

313
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,640
a good use of time dinner has to be made

314
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,050
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of boring you might as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well be</font>

315
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,120
working while you're doing it we know

316
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,240
that interleaving or pipelining tasks hi

317
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's latency and almost everyone works</font>

318
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,440
when they're cooking dinner anyway both

319
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,730
were there any questions on that survey

320
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,470
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have had as a</font>

321
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,610
gynecologist there were other things I

322
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,230
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been curious about people</font>

323
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,610
doing while they're working from home

324
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,370
but those were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not asked those questions</font>

325
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,810
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> not asked to be fair so this is</font>

326
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,430
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides that I</font>

327
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">worried people would think we're bashing</font>

328
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,920
on working from home let me be clear

329
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,120
among this list these unlike reading

330
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,610
from the slide these are the things that

331
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've done at work watch TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and movies</font>

332
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,220
played video games had a drink took a

333
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,290
nap I've never done household chores<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

334
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">12like phone calls to make a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dentist</font>

335
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,709
appointment<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the kids all the time so</font>

336
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,060
like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to squeeze the</font>

337
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:54,650
work in at work so yeah it just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

338
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,510
clear all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't mean people</font>

339
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,100
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not productive at home it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

340
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:02,780
means all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that other stuff is happening</font>

341
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,370
too so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so does it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work this is actually</font>

342
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,069
one of the most important and one of the

343
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,170
most robust studies that's been done to

344
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:12,890
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this and it's pretty famous if</font>

345
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,829
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a search engine on the web and</font>

346
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,779
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for data</font>

347
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:21,510
you will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across this study and it's</font>

348
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,760
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a fun study to read so I will</font>

349
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,430
summarize it for you so this was a group

350
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,250
of Stanford researchers who study

351
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,170
Chinese call<font color="#E5E5E5"> center workers and the</font>

352
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,820
study is randomized although it's not

353
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfectly randomized and it is a</font>

354
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,160
crossover design so they got 10,000

355
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,910
science terms you're just confusing them

356
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,920
they use 10,000 Chinese call center

357
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,019
workers who volunteer to be randomized

358
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,959
to either work from work or everyone had

359
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,579
been working or work from home when they

360
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,560
randomly assigned them they found that

361
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people who were assigned to work</font>

362
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home had thirteen percent higher</font>

363
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,370
productivity they were more happy they

364
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:04,589
were more satisfied they had a nearly

365
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:06,839
fifty percent lower promotion rate after

366
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,029
they did that the crossover design was

367
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,670
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now we've randomly assigned</font>

368
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,500
you everybody choose so when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

369
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,089
to choose half of each group choose

370
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,860
chose the opposite of what they were

371
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,990
originally assigned to so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

372
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,510
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and when people were</font>

373
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,060
allowed to choose whether they worked

374
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,069
from work or worked from home they

375
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,680
increased productivity by<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-two</font>

376
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,600
percent so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple of really</font>

377
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,579
important take homes here one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them is</font>

378
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's it seems to be true that</font>

379
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:37,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make good decisions</font>

380
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,560
about what the work environment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

381
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,300
works well for them and that we should

382
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,020
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about letting people have that</font>

383
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,729
choice because even when people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

384
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,160
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work from work worked from</font>

385
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,230
home that was a less happy environment

386
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,810
for them then when everybody got to

387
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:58,079
choose I'm as an aside especially for

388
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,630
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the more congested</font>

389
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,609
areas of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

390
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,320
interesting community effects that were

391
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,630
noted i mean 10,000 people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a small</font>

392
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">city in china is not an insignificant</font>

393
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,160
number and they were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

394
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,260
lower vehicle emissions but increased

395
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,269
sprawl so as more people got to work

396
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,860
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> home they drove to work less but</font>

397
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:20,040
they started moving farther away from

398
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">work and expanding the city yeah and</font>

399
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,029
we're going to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to a couple of</font>

400
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,880
the other findings from this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so</font>

401
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,899
there's a you guys may not have looked

402
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this but there is a widespread</font>

403
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,699
we believed adage which is people are

404
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:35,680
productive when they are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

405
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,660
home but creative when they're working

406
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,239
from work and those are a little bit

407
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,279
overloaded term so by productive I mean

408
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,709
when there's a set of defined work or

409
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,869
defined tasks people<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is believed that</font>

410
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:48,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are more efficient accomplishing</font>

411
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:50,800
those tasks when they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working from</font>

412
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,540
home in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general with some caveats about</font>

413
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,118
choice and some people hate working from

414
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:58,179
home in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stanford Chinese call center</font>

415
00:15:55,119 --> 00:16:00,009
study and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are creative and</font>

416
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:03,879
by creative I mean they are more likely

417
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:07,689
to invent new products patent to new

418
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:09,610
ideas develop new approaches to solving

419
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:12,399
problems when they're working from work

420
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,230
this is believed there's some data

421
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,199
around this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data around this are</font>

422
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">very weak and confusing so the first</font>

423
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,229
thing around the is that I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

424
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:22,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention and I know this is an</font>

425
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,220
uncomfortable topic for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience is</font>

426
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,179
that human beings are complicated

427
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,649
there's another thing that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

428
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:32,319
bit difficult for this audience to admit

429
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,819
culture matters so most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work</font>

430
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:36,189
that's been done on this has been done

431
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:38,199
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Americans that's awesome but</font>

432
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:40,360
Americans are actually very particular

433
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:42,670
first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're individualistic but</font>

434
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,889
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get tension and creativity out of</font>

435
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">working in groups this is a weird sort</font>

436
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:51,160
of set of cultural predilections that's

437
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:52,809
not universal so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Americans Americans</font>

438
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,569
do appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more creative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

439
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:58,059
they're working in groups optimal

440
00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:00,819
amounts of creativity are when you work

441
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:04,418
with people you know well enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

442
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:07,688
trust and that that group tolerates

443
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:09,669
dissent and tolerates friction so

444
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,799
there's a lot of data around diversity

445
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:13,270
for example that people come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

446
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,039
diverse backgrounds gender diversity

447
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,109
racial and ethnic language diversity

448
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,599
diversity of professional background

449
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,010
diversity of professional experience

450
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,869
difference in approach to solving a

451
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:25,029
problem that one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

452
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:27,579
see is that that those differences

453
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,260
bubble up in tension and conflict and if

454
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,600
the group is able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tolerate that</font>

455
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,110
tension and conflict creative approaches

456
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,389
result out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that there's a this kind</font>

457
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,549
of creativity and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tension</font>

458
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,779
is less<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely to occur in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work from</font>

459

460
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,080
to your relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> with your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> family</font>

461
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,059
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm certain that there's plenty</font>

462
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,519
of tension there and perhaps maybe even

463
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:51,129
tolerated maybe not that's you and your

464
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:53,110
shrinks problem but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it is</font>

465
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,940
less likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you will encounter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

466
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,729
kind of tension while working over a

467
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,279
remote channel so understanding these

468
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:04,659
dynamics what are the dynamics that give

469
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:07,000
rise to this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tension tolerated</font>

470
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:08,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">dissent in order to create creativity is</font>

471
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,820
an interesting technological challenge

472
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,668
we're going to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a little bit</font>

473
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,350
oh there's one interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

474
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:18,820
mention what was the interesting thing

475
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,529
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention there oh that no no that's</font>

476
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,418
fine we'll deal with that later<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

477
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:26,130
this goes on to dr. Perry gets a coffee

machine so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lily got a coffee machine so</font>

479
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,389
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a pretty famous place in</font>

480

Pittsburgh the<font color="#CCCCCC"> makii</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> women's research</font>

482
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,990
million arse tons of NIH money and they

483

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this research and they didn't</font>

484

have and you guys those of you who work

485
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,690
in education know this like there's no

486
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,449
common space there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no nice lounge</font>

487
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,340
there's no like coffee machine there's

<font color="#E5E5E5">no espresso machines there's no snacks</font>

489
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,590
there's just like offices and dank

490
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,209
hallways and like a water cooler that

491
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,039
hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been fixed since nineteen sixty</font>

492
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,620
seven or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and like the</font>

493
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">money and research is like bleeding out</font>

494
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,889
right now so there's no money but these

495
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,990
guys are serious about the science so

496
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:06,879
they looked at the set of papers done by

497
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,389
a famous biomedical institution in

498
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cambridge that's not MIT Harvard and</font>

499
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:15,820
they looked at the geolocation of

500
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,740
authors positions in space and then they

501
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,080
cited the significance and significance

502
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,490
is pretty easy in really rigid academic

503
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,230
communities because you can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say how</font>

504
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,059
many people cited<font color="#E5E5E5"> their talk right and</font>

505
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,279
that's a pretty good metric of like was

506
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:29,168
it important it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect but it's</font>

507
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,480
decent and so the talks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

508
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">most important are the talks with the</font>

509
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,500
highest number of intra building

510
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:37,210
collaborators and there were some

511
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,710
buildings like individual buildings that

512
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,240
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like producing all the most</font>

513
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,500
significant papers because they had the

514
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,679
most collaboration within the building

515
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,210
so the magee-womens<font color="#CCCCCC"> Research Institute</font>

516
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,679
saw that's not like all right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

517
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,299
gotta pony up for our coffee machine and

518
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,059
they got a coffee machine it's pretty

519
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:54,010
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Harbor so the last thing I</font>

520
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,850
want to point out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a widely</font>

521
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">stated study so there's this</font>

522
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,449
set of evidence that looks like in

523
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">general most people are more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> productive</font>

524
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,490
at defined tasks at home most people are

525
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,289
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> creative and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> innovative at work but</font>

526
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,299
not universally with some exceptions and

527
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,950
then there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business press is</font>

528
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:11,990
full of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular study that says</font>

529
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">AHA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the case people can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font>

530
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,700
creative at home to on under these

531
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,830
circumstances<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reporting so not</font>

532
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,539
surprisingly in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> social sciences the</font>

533
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,370
reporting about the study is bad but the

534
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:23,960
study itself is pretty bad too so it's

535
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,820
kind of a wash as to whose fault it is

536
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,640
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any sense what</font>

537
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:32,960
the study actually shows and this is

538
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:35,270
really important is that less structure

539
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,280
and by structure we mean organizational

540
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,500
structure and communication structure

541
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,120
promotes creativity and in the

542
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,909
particular groups that they looked at

543
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,469
they the people working from home happen

544
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have less organizational and</font>

545
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">communications structure in their work</font>

546
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,049
environments while they were working on

547
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,120
tasks that involved innovation or

548
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">creativity and so there were more</font>

549
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,570
innovative and<font color="#E5E5E5"> creative but it doesn't</font>

550
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually when you take those same kinds</font>

551
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,860
of less structured communication and

552
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:02,510
organizational environment so you put

553
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">them on work from work then those people</font>

554
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,890
get creative again<font color="#E5E5E5"> also so it turns out</font>

555
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,390
the study is useful but not for any of

556
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,659
the reasons anybody who has been

557
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:13,880
popularizing it say it was um so I want

558
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:15,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to one of the points from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">your career goodbye remember that they</font>

562
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,590
were fifty percent less likely to get

563
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,620
promoted when they worked from home and

564
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,629
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am really genuinely sorry to tell you</font>

565

that this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the single most</font>

567
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:37,610
this research in that everyone who's

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:41,240
looked at this without<font color="#CCCCCC"> exception has</font>

569
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:43,820
showed the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these definitions vary across</font>

572
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,419
studies do not get promoted as often

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,399

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,590

and terms like them less often

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> presents some pretty significant</font>

are actually researchers across a broad

range of disciplines trying to figure

out what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us physically</font>

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:08,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good meta-analysis out there that</font>

603
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,409
looks at these data all together you

604
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,659
know a meta-analysis is when you take

605
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,629
all the papers you do actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

606
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,129
fancy statistical measures on all of

607
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:19,799
their results to try to figure out

608
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's a true way to interpret all of</font>

the data together using math<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight like</font>

611
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:29,728
my here um so work from<font color="#E5E5E5"> home did have a</font>

612
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:32,429
persistent small beneficial effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

613
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:34,559
certain proximal outcomes reduced work

614
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:36,690
family conflict and people said that

615
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">they felt more autonomous I'm job</font>

satisfaction performance and<font color="#CCCCCC"> turnover</font>

intent but not actual turnover are

618
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,970
improved with work from home and roll

619
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:47,699
stress which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really specific</font>

620
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,129
sort of sociologic measurement were

621
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,960
improved and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who worked from</font>

622
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:54,090
home greater than two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half days a</font>

623
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,849
week had more challenging co-worker

624
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,590
relationships and the data so at the end

625
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:00,689
of a meta-analysis you kind of get to

626
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,849
say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quality of the data that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

627
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,739
results are based on is like good

628
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:10,049
mediocre or bad and these data are

629
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:12,869
mediocre so basically it's a wash<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

630
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,190
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of that so we're at the</font>

631
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there are some</font>

advantages for work from home<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

633
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:20,850
happier in some ways they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

634
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,140
slightly more productive

635
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,629
if they're given the choice to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

636
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">home and want to work from home but</font>

637
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,820
relationships with coworkers are more

638
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,680
challenging and creativity and

639
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,060
innovation might suffer but some people

640
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,590
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to work from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home so</font>

641
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,810
we decided to say okay set aside the

642
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,220
data about what works and what doesn't

643
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:38,370
what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that improves the</font>

644
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:41,040
chances of it working well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

645
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:43,979
like the this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> available in the data</font>

646
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,360
and all things outside of your field can

647
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,860
be learned at a dinner party so we went

648
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,929
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dinner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> party with David Anderson</font>

649

who's in has friggin a bunch of you know

650
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">him and there was Justin castle who does</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about this which makes it pretty</font>

657
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,370
questionable why we're here talking to

658
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you but anyway bygones um we're like it</font>

baby to look at for a little while as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

662
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really entertaining I'm sorry you</font>

663
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,770
guys missed it actually no in any case

664
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,540
we're like so tell us what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

665
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,910
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of pointers and we looked at</font>

666
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the research so um here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

667
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,380
that work much much better having a

668
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:28,470
policy and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about who</font>

669
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,330
has a policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> a initial impersonal</font>

670
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,340
traction doesn't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a good</font>

671
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea it looks like it's more or less</font>

672
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:38,399
essential for two reasons one of them is

673
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,440
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it significantly improves trust and</font>

674
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,660
Trust is something that you need in

675
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,280
order to tolerate dissent and dissent a

676
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,170
disagreement is something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do</font>

677
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,060
anything innovative or creative so you

678
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,130
got to have that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other reason is</font>

679
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,990
that and we all don't like to admit this

680
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,910
relationships that are initially and

681
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,030
primarily electronic are easily

682
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:59,220
discarded people actually we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

683
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,050
care about them that much there may be

684
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,300
people that you've chatted with daily on

685
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,129

<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty important good communication and</font>

communication in different modes of

obvious right shared interest with

different ideas about how to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

strengths in accomplishing that there's

this really amusing there needs to be

703

perception of balanced effort but you

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,650
attention wise incapable of working<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

716
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,920
home effectively and so some people are

717
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously better at this than others so</font>

718
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,910
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay work or home gotta have a</font>

719
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,790
policy right it's good to have a policy

720
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,740
uh so we said well like who's got

721
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,210
policies because we know I'm like buddy

722
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,410
show of hands how many people here work

723
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,380
from home at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and a half days a</font>

724
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,760
week alright see you so like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

725
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,370
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people here work for a company</font>

726
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,810
that has a policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> describing how you</font>

727
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,370
work from home see that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

728
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,500
talking about like this is like it went

729
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,389
down to ten percent by the way right so

730
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,700
we're like okay who's got a policy

731
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:36,370
what's going on here right so we started

732
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking so there's one pretty large</font>

733
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,000
company that famously changed their

734
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,590
practices although it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear what</font>

735
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">their former policy was and it's not</font>

736
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,070
actually clear what their current policy

737
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> on working from home and that's sort</font>

738
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what started people rethinking about</font>

739
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:52,480
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google fairly famously has</font>

740
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,620
very few people working from home but

741
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,130
some people do there are actually a

742
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:59,379
small number of of people who work from

743
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">home and there's a pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> medium sized</font>

744
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,130
number of people who work from<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote in</font>

745
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,720
other words they work at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

746
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,760
facility but they work primarily with

747
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,650
people that are not at that facility so

748
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to judge where that fits</font>

749
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,490
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the data um Cisco I mean just</font>

750
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know it so Cisco got a bunch of</font>

751
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and like love them to</font>

752
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,310
death but all their stuff about this is

753
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,900
about selling gear they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

754
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,610
selling software and so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

755
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,260
difficult to get any value out of

756
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,120
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> they publisher because you</font>

757
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,340
should buy some stuff from<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and it'll</font>

758
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,750
be great and like of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should</font>

759
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,189
buy some stuff from<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as long as they</font>

760
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,690
keep sponsoring now you should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

761
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,250
doing that but there's nothing in the

762
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,140
stuff that they publish to help you

763
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,570
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what works or even exactly</font>

764
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">what their policy is IBM has been</font>

765
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,899
claiming for about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years that they're</font>

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this aggressive everybody worked from</font>

claiming forty percent work hours

770
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:51,009
are done<font color="#E5E5E5"> remotely that's awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

771
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:52,899
they roll in their entire sales force

772
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:54,190
into that number and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I don't know</font>

773
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,689
what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because if you had</font>

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,249
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who were never working</font>

775
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,990
at the office<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

776
00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:00,669
outside sales people how much of a

777
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,990
change is this really it's awesome that

778
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,279
they have good technology around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

779
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's not clear that they're taking</font>

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditional collaborative you know</font>

781
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,480
technology and engineering tasks or

782
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,129
management tasks and moving them

783
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,450
remotely but the punch<font color="#E5E5E5"> line though is</font>

784
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:19,449
almost all of the technology industry

785
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">lets some of the best people they like</font>

786
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,070
the most work from home with no policy

787
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:27,580
and just kind of calls it good until

788
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:32,230
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and that as we've shown is</font>

789
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:34,689
pretty mediocre so concluding you want

790
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,460
to cover conclusions sure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

791
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,080
primarily work from home seem to be less

00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,639
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get promoted like I'm really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry to deliver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that news but that</font>

794
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:43,479
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does seem to be true and clearly</font>

795
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,460
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do something about that but</font>

796
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,190
they also seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more productive at</font>

797
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,799
least when they are Americans they may

798
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,629
have less creative solutions and if

799
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,220
anyone's interested in those data those

800
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:56,139
studies are fascinating I would be

801
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,190
totally happy the studies are footnoted

802
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:58,508
in here so you could go read them

803
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,909
yourself or you could ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about that</font>

804
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:02,830
or anything else at the break lot of

805
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:03,789
food um they seem to be happier with

806
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,939
family but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font>

807
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:10,749
happier in general but the data are kind

808
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">of crummy and so we don't really know so</font>

809
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:15,070
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the like real things to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

810
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:18,369

811
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:21,279
important and we don't know why and your

812
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:23,259
boss needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see your face if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

813
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,970
to get promoted you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent</font>

814
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:28,419
excellent communications infrastructure

815
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:30,190
to do this diverse teams still do way

816
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:32,350
better and explicit policies are

817
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,869
probably a good idea but very few people

818
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,570
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> them just a quick clarification um</font>

819
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:41,408
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> case people are confused this is not</font>

00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:44,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">what diversity looks like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't</font>

821
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:47,230
want anybody to misunderstand that all

822
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:50,678
right irrational exuberance questions

823
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,460
that oh good<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow Oh rock and roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

840
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,080
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> be clear the actual data here</font>

841
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,630
don't even distinguish between people

842
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,370
who work from an office without with a

843

promotional thing out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you sping</font>

862
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,090
the promotion you had hinted that there

863
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:24,309
was additional data other than just call

864
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,830
center drones that did not get promoted

865
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:30,158
by not being seen by their 19th century

866
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:32,139
meant factory mentality managers is

867

crowd data or you know to hinted I

869
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,090
didn't see any of the fun notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font>

870
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,460
depends on what you consider relevant

871
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:44,678
like not not to be obnoxious no no truly

872
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,480
I we could not<font color="#CCCCCC"> find any data that</font>

873
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,130
actually looked at you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if there</font>

874
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,779
any graduate students I don't know in

875
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,570
the audience where are the graduate

876
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:53,980
students<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely wanted to</font>

encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor / to continue this work</font>

878
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,860
because not the least of which because

879
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:58,940
then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see her more often and</font>

880
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,459
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be awesome</font>

881
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,410
and another variable that that's

882
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,720
worthwhile considering is in the work

883
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:09,320
from work thing other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the you know</font>

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,620
office space would be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

886
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:16,850
variable to include in this future work

887
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:19,520
that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea interesting talk um</font>

888
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:23,090
who are you Ted ceiling sprint sorry

889
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dave is there any data from this that</font>

890
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,889
shows by like industry type or sector

891
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,040
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fortune 50 fortune 100</font>

892
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,660
where this how this worked from home

893
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,790
thing distributes across those guys

894
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,040
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm curious you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

895
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:40,030
text industry centric thing that you're

896
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,500
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at or is it across the board I</font>

897
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:44,300
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that that you guys</font>

898
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,310
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving these researchers a little</font>

899
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,700
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more credit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than is actually due to</font>

900
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:51,950
them no I really that I mean right very

901
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,010
obvious question I wish we had the

902
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,200
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so that it's a mess these</font>

903
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:59,180
studies are a mess because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

904
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,430
have consistent definitions they're not

905
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,410
consistently looking at the same worker

906
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,570
populations but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell you there</font>

907
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:08,720
are a couple of papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are cited</font>

908
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:10,730
that are looking at professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> workers</font>

909
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,759
but none of them look specifically at

910
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:16,310
you know IT workers but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

911
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,070
professional worker ones are sort of the

912
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:21,529
closest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get and no they don't</font>

913
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:24,440
break it down by sort of fortune 50

914
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,540
fortune 500 the problem with that in

915
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,120
part has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with the way business</font>

916
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,850
school research and employer sort of

917
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,489
research gets done so there are for

918
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,350
example white papers released by

919
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,750
corporations who studied their own

920
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you read those and you think like</font>

921
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,280
I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't tell me</font>

922
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,830
everything right and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they</font>

923
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably don't so the data are just not</font>

924
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,610
that great in terms of what's out there

925
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,290
now again a call to the graduate

926
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:57,080
students in the audience wherever you

927
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:59,900
are thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you networking if I was</font>

928
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,299
juniper one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

929
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,410
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is medical collusion is being</font>

930
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,420
bad

931
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,870
we'll work from home are not necessarily

932
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,750
is promoted as much know if we go way

933
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:13,910
back no to a book called Peter Principle

934
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:16,940
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people tend to get promoted to</font>

935
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:19,160
their level of<font color="#CCCCCC"> and competence and one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

936
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,600
the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be observed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

937
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,109
people that are in industries that can

938
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:26,000
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> working from home is that does</font>

939
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,980
that company have or have not a

940
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,690
technical track versus a managerial

941
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,850
track because typically what promotion

942
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">means after a certain point most</font>

943
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,480
companies is you get pushed up to

944
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">management and that's not necessarily</font>

945
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">where people have no their skills and</font>

946
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:42,590
where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do the best job yeah</font>

947
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,020
that's it it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sound point we</font>

948
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,000
did not mean to imply that<font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

949
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,880
getting promoted or making more money

950
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,160
were universally desired or positive the

951
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,150
point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is to highlight that this</font>

952
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,399
appears to be a fairly firm outcome of

953
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,660
spending most of your time remotely if

954
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,610
it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're happy with your</font>

955
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,560
salary and you live somewhere like cheap

956
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,150
and it's good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and your lifestyle</font>

957
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,460
and your family you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel the need</font>

958
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:09,110
to get promoted then like full

959
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">disclosure you're all set right so yeah</font>

960
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:15,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">no it's a fair point and we should have</font>

961
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:17,840
hit that harder thanks my pound said

962
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:22,160
Phileas justify your crack smoking there

963
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:24,260
first no yeah I keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling we keep</font>

964
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,890
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of them baby please</font>

965
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,870
succeed so there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple of</font>

966
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,180
studies out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are sort of might</font>

967
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:37,420
be peripheral<font color="#CCCCCC"> e related to this that</font>

968
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:39,830
I've seen that look into constant our

969
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,920
problem solving and creativity as

970
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:46,779
related to a concentration and

971
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,800
interruption and met so my own like

972
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,540
personal experience from this is that

973
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">working from home I actually get a lot</font>

974
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,380
more creative work done because I don't

975
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,410
get somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wandering by my desk every</font>

976
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:59,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 minutes to say hi or to ask a random</font>

977
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,970
question or whatever those stuff that

978
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,410
stuff all goes into email and when I'm

979
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,879
done solving the problem i'm working on

980
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,100
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and check on that and and</font>

981
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,040
i find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of stuff becomes</font>

982
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,200
way more productive when i'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

983
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,300
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in some code or do</font>

984
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,910
a design work or

985
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,130
anything like that and I'm kind of

986
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,710
curious if you guys came across anything

987
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,510
related to that when we were when you're

988
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on this that was to be honest</font>

989
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,330
that's part of why although<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pictures</font>

990
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,740
that we put in of where we're working

991
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,970
right now are kind of funny that's part

992
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,040
of why we put them in actually if you

993
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,720
look at my<font color="#E5E5E5"> work from home environment I</font>

994
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,540
have many<font color="#E5E5E5"> fewer distractions than todd</font>

995
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,180
has his work from work environment and

996
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,890
that's true i would tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

997
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,720
answer on the creativity thing is a long

998
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,370
answer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going to like delay</font>

999
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,200
everyone's coffee with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the long answer</font>

1000
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,819
but i would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you about it</font>

1001
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,140
because the the data on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> creativity</font>

1002
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:52,180
stuff are fascinating and so yes I and I

1003
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,339
can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you having been an intern and a</font>

1004
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,589
resident<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's robust data from</font>

1005
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,820
studying us about interruption and the

1006
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,830
way in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> our capacity to</font>

1007
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,810
problem-solve goes right down the tubes

1008
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:04,600
when you interrupt me every 15 seconds

1009
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:06,759
my pager goes off right so that is true

1010
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the creativity part is they really</font>

1011
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,530
do those pagers I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> kidding sorry</font>

1012
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,049
you said pager and they're like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

1013
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">says or what is a pager sorry going um</font>

1014
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,410
but the creativity stuff is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

1015
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,240
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated but I'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to</font>

1016
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,859
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about that in detail he</font>

likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only other thing to point out</font>

1018
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,670
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember and this may be obvious</font>

1019
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,830
to you guys is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> intra-group</font>

1020
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,900
differences massively outweigh the

1021
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,790
intergroup differences human beings are

1022
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,290
complicated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a huge range of</font>

1023
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,330
behaviors this is like when people look

1024
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:36,220
at gender differences in though I women

1025
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,810
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> X and men are lying you're like</font>

1026
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,790
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-percent different set the</font>

1027
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,380
peaks and massively overlapping curves

1028
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,300
right this is just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

1029
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,670
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> for whom this doesn't apply</font>

1030
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,380
and your anecdotes will fit into these

1031
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:51,700
curves somewhere Randy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

1032
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:54,600
question Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> bush iij um this was</font>

1035
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:03,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">David in the audience why they find the</font>

1036
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,370
profession of gynecology more amusing

1037
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:07,900
than router geek and why people laughed

1038
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,220
at broad I thought was a rather

1039
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,220
obnoxious comment

1040
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:18,270
I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the audience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not</font>

1042
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,890
gynecology is kind of funny like I've

1045
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,250
it's funny I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to have a</font>

1046
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,440
sense of humor about what you do for

1047
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,430
living and to be honest I sometimes take

1048
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,530
care of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in life-or-death</font>

1049
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,480
situations and at the end of the day I

1050
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:45,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to laugh about it or I'm</font>

offensive but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was in no way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meant</font>
