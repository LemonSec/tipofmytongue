1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,460
let's get started

2
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,980
daanyik knife slides

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,170
ah thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you okay so this is the best</font>

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,960
current operational practices track I'm

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron Hughes and just moderating the</font>

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,770
track this is open to absolutely anybody

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,769
and the the spirit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best current</font>

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">operational practices track is</font>

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,090
effectively to have a living repository

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,179
of best<font color="#E5E5E5"> current operational practices</font>

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,800
documents so the simple problem

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,989
statement here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,839
one of these operator groups you know

14
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:57,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have presentations globally they all</font>

15
00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:01,089
get archived on their respective

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,040
operator forums usually without text and

17
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:04,870
without audio and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as</font>

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,210
they're presented they are almost

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">useless because they are stale and it's</font>

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,750
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell what's actually</font>

current living relevant and of course

22
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">vetted so we tried to start this as a</font>

00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">global effort which turned out to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,689
bit challenging and decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

25
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,310
would start working locally and work on

26
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,880
a template eyes version of a best

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,930
current operational practices track

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,759
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> that template available for</font>

29
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,789
anybody in any operational region who

30
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,399
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write best current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operational</font>

00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,960
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a global process as well so</font>

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">that things can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be converted into global</font>

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,509
documents that'd by lots of operational

36
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:56,020

<font color="#CCCCCC">list resources etc to tune an augs</font>

38

a regional<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcop repository so we now</font>

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a new website which what does this</font>

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,330
do put this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other screen awesome</font>

45
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,430
which I'm sure everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can read</font>

46
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,890
perfectly clearly from back there so

47
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,060
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> BC opine on organ is now in wiki</font>

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,870
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a little easier than</font>

50
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,310
our last one so you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> right off the</font>

51
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,890
main page there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some links at the</font>

60
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,590
on and I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> totally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> broke the last</font>

62
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,620
people know it's dead but i'll put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

63
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,819
redirect in there as well I'm so today's

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,709
agenda is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward it's</font>

65
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,018
going to go over the current dcop drafts

66
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,760
and then we've decided to sort of run

67
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,349
this layout and by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm open to</font>

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,920
any suggestions you can feel free to

send to a bc o P dash support<font color="#CCCCCC"> at mailman</font>

man dot nano dead org if you've got some

71
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,650
suggestions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any process change or</font>

72
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,840
standards or things that you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

73
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">see done to this but we're running this</font>

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,660
as current<font color="#E5E5E5"> bc o P drafts new appeals</font>

75
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,849
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a global</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vco p</font>

76
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,709
update from<font color="#CCCCCC"> richard Jimmerson of i sock</font>

77
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:49,018
and then open microphone and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

78
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,859
will start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our first bc o P draft</font>

79
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:55,319
ipv6 peering transit and Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grundmann</font>

80
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:59,569
is going to give an update on that this

81
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,569
is some yeah this is the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

82
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:07,170
do you want the texture yeah it's

83
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect to be in front of you</font>

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:21,049
so this is aaron said this is the ipv6

85
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:23,160
peering basically bgb peering<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcop draft</font>

86
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:25,560
and we've talked about this a little bit

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> god so it may be somewhat</font>

88
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,350
familiar folks we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

89
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,230
list a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it still needs</font>

90
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,620
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more content a little bit</font>

91
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,850
more vetting before we ratify it there's

92
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,050
been some some questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have come</font>

93
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,540
up so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to walk through the</font>

94
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:44,210
document real quick so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

95
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:47,910
what's in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I can't even</font>

96
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,380
know so there's you know there's the

97
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,060
standard appeal at the top and then it

98
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the background of what we're</font>

99
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing here and really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea behind</font>

100
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,979
this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> its ipv6 specific but the idea</font>

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,510
was since purine in general right how to

102
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,610
set up sessions the filtering that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

103
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,620
in on that is a big part of it we

104
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,390
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a very good job of making</font>

105
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,120
that standard in I could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> for there's</font>

106
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,650
some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known best practices</font>

107
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,150
but they're not definitely not across

108
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,460
the board and definitely not universal

109
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,349
and so with ipv6 as we're all turning up

110
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,940
ipv6 or at least have recently and don't

111
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a lot of traffic on it yet there's</font>

112
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,820
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it</font>

113
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I mean that could be six that's</font>

114
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:28,200
what we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so then it dives</font>

115
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:30,419
into the WTOP itself and the first chunk

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,330
of that is established<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could be</font>

117
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">six only peering sessions parallel to</font>

118
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,229
any ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions you already have so</font>

119
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here isn't necessarily</font>

120
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,250
physically separate circuits but

121
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,740
logically separate connections so if

122
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,960
you're going to exchange ipv6 routes use

123
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,820
ipv6 neighbors and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

124
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange ipv4 routes use at the v4</font>

125
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,270
neighbors and have two separate sessions

126
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,800
so there's some you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you eliminate</font>

127
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,419
the wrong kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fake sharing and</font>

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,419
include the right kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fake sharing</font>

129
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:04,229
the second piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bc o P is filter</font>

130
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,300
and this again is a big chunk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

131
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:08,820
have in here right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so it starts with</font>

132
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,190
filtering route coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your</font>

133
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,780
customers right and this one I think

134
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">most people understand fairly easily</font>

135
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,190
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers should be most small</font>

136
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,090
customers you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just know what</font>

137
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,260
routes they're using right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

138
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,849
lazy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to either manually or</font>

139
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,409
somehow update you on what routes

140
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,760
they're using what their IP space is or

141
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,760
the space you've given them even

142
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,440
easier and then only<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow those routes</font>

143
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,520
obviously or if they're a bigger

144
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,219
customer you could potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

145
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,049
something more dynamic and speaking of

146
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,030
more dynamic things that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we</font>

147
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,000
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into filtering routes coming</font>

148
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,309
from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers and up streams again</font>

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,470
same thing here with the more dynamic

150
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,230
filtering if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use an irr or</font>

151
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,180
some way to actively monitor what routes

152
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,510
they're using or at least a prefix count

153
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,560
at the very least and and filter that so

154
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,180
you're only accepting the routes you

155
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,590
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see from them and</font>

156
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're fat finger mistakes don't cause</font>

157
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,690
problems on your network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then of</font>

158
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,910
course filtering your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own routes right</font>

159
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,410
so you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself by</font>

160
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,540
filtering<font color="#CCCCCC"> your customers routes that</font>

161
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,820
they're advertising you<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because and</font>

162
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,320
filtering<font color="#CCCCCC"> your peers and Japan and up</font>

163
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,610

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,050
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your network we also want to</font>

165
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,850
be the good citizen and filter your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

166
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,780
routes going out and again this it

167
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be something that's fairly easy</font>

168
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,979
for yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you should know</font>

169
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,510
what you should be advertising hopefully

170
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,680
and then also installing that

171
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,380
information which i think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

172
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,700
another section down here so use an irr

173
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,560
so that other people can filter your

174
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,670
routes as well right so if you install

175
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,830
all of your apps in some form of

176
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,020
Internet routing registry so that other

177
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,820
people can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you are expecting to</font>

178
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,570
advertise they can filter against that

179
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:42,180
and actually be useful as well there

180
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,610
then we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> another section on using</font>

181
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,690
I cam which I think comes into play a

182
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,460
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I could be six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

183
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,860
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> did night before because you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

184
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,330
lot more addresses and and bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of space</font>

185
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,310
to deal with so it becomes even more

186
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,270
important to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand where</font>

187
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,170
you're handing out the space<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

188
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,180
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the space within your</font>

189
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:02,850

190
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:04,460
that irr and other things there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

191
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's one more section yeah so</font>

192
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,870
carrying DB right we believe it's a best

193
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,609
current operational practice to use

194
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,110
period EV so that there's handy

195
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,600
information on your network and how to

196
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">contact you in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the appearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> database</font>

197
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,880
and that way if you do it you can expect

198
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,330
others to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well so today that's</font>

199
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,120
kind of the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> crux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's in the</font>

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> nitty-gritty details of the text</font>

202
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,010
in those sections can probably be hashed

203
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,419
out on the mailing list but other big

204
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,880
glaring holes would be good to hear

and whether there was issues there are

differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're armed and so I'd</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open it up for any comments on</font>

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,089
then like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that soon we'll have this in a</font>

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,740
wiki format so you can actually beat on

it a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit easier on the wiki</font>

itself there's anything else I think

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's it so yeah that's appearing</font>

things the wrong way so it's it's very

<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to have a well vetted document to</font>

definitely review and chime in even if

it's a plus one or a thumbs up that's

00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:35,849
arbitrarily arbitrary length and the

282
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:39,540
other question is why is it you want a

283
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:42,360
ipv6 header chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's 22 kilobytes</font>

284
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,189
long in the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a</font>

285
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,639
lot of ways you could cause mischief

286
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:50,490
with such a head of chain but given that

287
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,920
we don't include the ESP or aah headers

288
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:57,589
in the header chain I can't see a real

289
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:01,128
use for wanting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 kilobit set of</font>

290
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,129
extension headers so

291
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:07,560
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do well one thing we can do</font>

292
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,480
is write a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp saying we're going to</font>

293
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,910
pick an arbitrary length for the maximum

294
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">length of a header chain and in this</font>

295
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,980
header chain we're going to not count

296
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,260
the ESP in that chain we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

297
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick that length and if we see a packet</font>

298
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:26,750
with more extension headers than that

299
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:29,190
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to drop the packet and</font>

300
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:32,700
at this point I'm looking for community

301
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:41,220
feedback on that is that a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font>

302
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:44,670
do or is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad thing to do and I</font>

303
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:53,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">will assume that silence is people</font>

304
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:58,319
reading their email Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> bush iij um</font>

305
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,180
why do I want more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there</font>

306
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:06,920
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question about what that arbitrary</font>

307
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:13,890
length should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a candidate 0 I</font>

308
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:17,610
want the encryption hitter well actually

309
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,780
i'll argue that some might be useful in

310
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,870
the future there might be some

311
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,670
destination header there my life eg6 is

312
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,420
absolutely full of things that might be

313
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful in the future okay which is help</font>

314
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,000
guarantee that ipv6 does not have a

315
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,460
future<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be thrilled if we</font>

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,270
got a small number like 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero is</font>

317
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:43,590
really good no I asked why more than one

318
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:50,610
to be honest I can't give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

319
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:53,640
answer I do want one right encryption

320
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,440
header oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you're talking about</font>

321
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,189
number of headers not number of bytes in

322
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,200
the header correct ok this is the

323
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,000
proposal is about number of bytes in the

324
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,470
header and I'm saying we don't count the

325
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,290
encryption header so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> should i posle</font>

326
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,690
about the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bytes it's not the</font>

327
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,260
way we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these head</font>

328
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,450
I have sympathy for you as a router

329
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:24,350
vendor inversely proportional to how

330
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:27,650
much I pay you but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it in</font>

331
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,140
terms of headers not bikes and why do I

332
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,790
want more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

333
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,860
alternative proposal you're saying is

334
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,860
deprecated all headers except for ESP

335
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:46,550
yeah I'll so for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

336
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:52,400
probably need the aah also bad to use a

337
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:54,380
HH is bad but that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one not</font>

338
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:58,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">wikked one I said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted the</font>

339
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:02,890
encryption headers hmm ok one or the

340
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:05,150
other header yeah that that's a way to

341
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,890
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a way to dice this that</font>

342
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,199
might work you can have exactly one

343
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,840
extension header well not only that with

344
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,670
the sausage machine politics of the ITF

345
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:21,680
everyone will think they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

346
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:24,949
their header damn fools no Warren kumari

347
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,709
and I'm still too short<font color="#E5E5E5"> one issue with</font>

348
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:30,200
allowing just one is then you could end

349
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,000
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with one arbitrarily long extension</font>

350
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,670
header<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could have one extension</font>

351
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,470
header that happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know 1200</font>

352
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,620
bites and suddenly your router needs

353
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,810
second oh let's check if the router

354
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,090
vendors want to put some reasonable

355
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:47,089
limit on the bag count I can survive

356
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:51,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience but what I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of is</font>

357
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:56,180
extension headers not bites right and

358
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the Ahn ESP and all those are short</font>

359
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:02,750
headers mm-hmm so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not worried about</font>

360
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:06,140
20,000 bites mm-hmm I can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

361
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:10,069
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be see from from the asics point</font>

362
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,240
of view if there's ivory headers that

363
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:19,209
are combined 100 bytes long we can deal

364
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,209
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with today's asics yeah</font>

365
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,170
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> warrant worry again we were</font>

366
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">expecting this to be somewhat</font>

367
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:39,070
controversial or that people would be

368
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,540
wildly in favor of it but we don't seem

369
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,149
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a huge amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of feedback</font>

370
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,159
in either way do people just not care or

371
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,100
is this so obviously the right thing to

372
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:54,850
do that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go ahead or is</font>

373

email more interesting at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment Jim</font>

at Santa Cruz no email is not more

376
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:04,690
interesting right now it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> strikes me</font>

377
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,730
that this is an attempt to change a

378
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,890
protocol through a best current

379
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,540
practices process and it just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

380
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,950
the wrong way to do it if there's

381
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">something wrong with the protocol the</font>

382
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,820
protocol ought to be fixed best current

383
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:22,629
practices is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different than a</font>

384

protocol modification Randy again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

385
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:29,110
presume that's what you were doing

386
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,879
you're not um there's it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

387
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,969
something popular going on in the

internet and I sock and all that of

389
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,900
publishing best current practices I

391
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,970
this is protocol change and I have no

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:49,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem with it not my real question is</font>

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:53,530
the real life beefy<font color="#CCCCCC"> six folk in this</font>

394
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,560
room if they go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ITF and say</font>

395
00:18:53,530 --> 00:19:00,300
that they have heard from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a segment</font>

00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:09,270
benefit and no objection to chopping

398
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:13,330
this back now's the time to whine

399
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:16,900
exactly if I hear that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">2460 to restrict extension headers the</font>

weeks so or<font color="#E5E5E5"> enquiry again so this was</font>

404
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,450
sort of a double headed effort we

405
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a draft in the ITF that</font>

406
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,480
sort of proposing this and it's an

407
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,200
operational draft that our planes the

408
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,370
prob

409
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,169
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to be able to show is</font>

410
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">that operators actually think that this</font>

411
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:48,320
is a real issue and so if there's a

412
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,780
operators document that says in general

413
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,100
we drop these or it's a best practice to

414
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,299
drop these we might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right Walter Eames la</font>

416
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:01,940
telecom aren't we presuming now that

417
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,910
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix a protocol problem</font>

with iron and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't we presa</font>

419
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:11,299
presuppose that these frames can only be

420
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,710
switched in an a6 and if they fall

421
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,879
outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we can do something</font>

422

else has been making the operators

423
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,850
decision to drop them or not I mean it's

424
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,129

the packet this makes it a mess and

437
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:01,120
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like you as operators</font>

438
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:03,408
to think about or this order problem is

439
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,110
that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have some sort of</font>

extensibility mechanism built into your

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,159
that's the whole mess that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing</font>

446
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,539
with here it's completely arbitrary crap

447
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,470
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now well I think Brandis proposal</font>

448
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,270
you know the original there are two

450
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can have as many extension headers</font>

451
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,190
as you want as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the sum of bytes</font>

452
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,370
isn't bigger than some<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that we</font>

choose here the other is any given

454
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,658
packet can have exactly one extension

455
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,460
header so you can have a router alert in

456
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:46,070
this packet and you can have a

457
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,410
destination header in that packet but

458
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:52,290
not both that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be problematic</font>

459
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,930
oh the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other half of it is if you don't</font>

460
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,810

462
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,899
eventually you're going to say we could

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">just have to do this all over again for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be the doing the dropping and</font>

under what criteria it I've heard stuff

00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,970
about my asics can't handle it so that

470
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,260
would seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to imply that asics that</font>

current operational practices forum

474
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:35,580
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether operators want to</font>

480
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:51,990
future is good but if it's just a matter

481
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:55,230
of operators going forth and doing

482
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,630
things in configurations like we do with

483
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:00,750
/ 24 prefix lengths and other things and

484
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:02,990
v6 prefix links I think that's less of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

485
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,970
problem than changing the underlying

486
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:08,070
protocol because it's a lot while it's

487
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,080
baked into a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people's practices</font>

488
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,330
it's not something that's impossible to

489
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">change so I guess if you could touch on</font>

490
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,030
the question of who are you asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

491
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,770
doing this dropping is it routers is it

492
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,330
operators whatever that might help

493
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,750
clarify things well there's a chicken

494
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:26,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">and egg problem here if we write a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp</font>

495
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,180
that says operators may drop these

496
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:32,460
packets by configuration someone in the

497
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:39,060
IETF leaps up and says how dare you drop

498
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:44,190
valid packets so on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand if we</font>

499
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:48,450
change the ipv6 back to make those

500
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:53,040
packets now invalid now we have the

501
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:54,990
problem of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how we've changed</font>

502
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,399
the spec and you're dropping traffic

503
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was valid yes you know you've made</font>

504
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,140
traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was invalid yesterday valid</font>

505
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,490
today so somehow we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need consensus from</font>

506
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,290
the

507
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,590
operation community that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for</font>

508
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:08,450
operators to drop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

509
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change the spec to to say that</font>

510
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,340
these packets are now invalid so I would

511
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,050
take the analogy of prefix links and

512
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,510
apply it somewhat similarly it's

513
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:21,860
perfectly valid to have a / 127 route in

514
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:23,900
BGP operators are no way on earth going

515
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:28,219
to accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I think some sort of</font>

516
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:31,790
guidance that says if you are so crazy

517
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,470
as to do a to kill<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit packet or to</font>

518
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,559
kill them at extension header operators

519
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">are likely to drop it currently if they</font>

520
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,290
want to that is not problematic from my

521
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,350
perspective I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we were</font>

522
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,780
to go and make such things invalid in

523
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,899
the protocol then we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run the</font>

524
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,879
risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> of constraining our ability to do</font>

525
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,190
future extensibility so I'm perfectly

526
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,620
fine with making it possible for

527
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,260
operators to drop things beyond a

528
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:04,520
certain length that's relative it's

529
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,750
relevant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to current capabilities in</font>

530
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,639
current hardware with the understanding

531
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:11,120
that that threshold will evolve

532
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,530
organically as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACE exchange I hear</font>

533
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're saying but I think is that</font>

534
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,129
exactly the opposite of what the fellow

535
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:19,700
sitting to your left just said a while

536
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:21,590
ago at the mic or<font color="#CCCCCC"> what say your your</font>

538
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:32,830
I lost your name yeah is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

539
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,830
exact opposite of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you just said I</font>

540
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,190
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually making an argument</font>

541
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,470
either way I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

542
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,000
your argument in a sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounded</font>

543
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,620
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very own nothing concern I mean</font>

544
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,290
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now today we deal with with</font>

545
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,270
features in v4 that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 don't handle and</font>

546
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,639
they get punted up the software now now

547
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,410
it's ugly and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with wire speed</font>

548
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,679
but that's what the argument I thought I

549
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,059
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> you making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought you made all</font>

550
00:25:54,679 --> 00:26:00,910
or nothing either does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in silicon</font>

551
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:00,910
where we change the protocol um

552
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:11,019
I'm not quite sure I'm understanding the

553
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:14,499
question so it seems that there are

554
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,669
three options here possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> only two of</font>

555
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:18,399
which were being discussed until now

556
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:20,379
there's my router can't handle it and

557
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:24,879
asic therefore my router should drop it

558
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:26,168
there's this thing shooter should not be

559
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,490
completely allowed in protocol and

560
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,240
therefore it's going to be binary and

561
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:33,399
then there's this weird middle ground of

562
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,990
beyond a certain level of bytes or

563
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:36,939
whatever this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might cause problems</font>

564
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,769
so some people might cause it might drop

565
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,350
it and it might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get through and that</font>

566
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:43,330
seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the ugly messy reality of</font>

567
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:46,509
our current<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when things</font>

568
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:48,820
are too big or otherwise not handled by

569
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:50,679
equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> they get dropped and that</font>

570
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't fit in very nicely to the neat</font>

571
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,460
protocol specifications but that what

572
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:59,768
operation operators deal with all the

<font color="#CCCCCC">time yeah ah brandon ross network</font>

574
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:07,509
utility for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the nature of</font>

575
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:14,070
best current practices is that they

576
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:18,159
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be somewhat non-controversial and</font>

577
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:21,158
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm i'm sitting here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> torn up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Adele's</font>

578
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,379
this idea whether it whether this should

579
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,389
be a best current practice or not and

580
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:28,509
coming to the conclusion that I don't

581
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:30,369
think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be because it's too</font>

582
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:33,460
controversial and I think there's too

583
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:34,779
much we still don't know about how v6

584

will operate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world and</font>

585
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:39,369
certainly putting the list restriction

00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:41,889
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by the way I feel for the</font>

587
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:44,350
problem I really do like the it's a big

588
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:46,508

589
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,029
the solution is and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure that</font>

590
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:50,740
it's clear that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a best</font>

widely implemented and then have to be

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,559
backed out someday or worse we can't

back<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out someday because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so widely</font>

595
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,570
implemented and we have to go make-up

right so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> these operational</font>

practice restrictions we live with and

so I'll go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring with you that</font>

00:29:52,179 --> 00:30:02,410
it is a byte count issue or and that

625
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:06,280
probably a current practice statement is

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to do it we agree I you know</font>

fact that i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to pay a</font>

ridiculous amount for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASIC swap and</font>

to upgrade for this stupid reason

<font color="#CCCCCC">Matt pancetta filius I kind of agree</font>

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,770
with Brandon I think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">tricky at this point because we don't it</font>

637
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,730
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound like we have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

638
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:44,120
operational experience to draw<font color="#E5E5E5"> from to</font>

639
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">say we can't do this but like it doesn't</font>

640
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">sound like there are a lot of operators</font>

641
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:50,090
who come forward to say yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm dropping</font>

642
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,678
that stuff so don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it so probably I</font>

643
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,918
think the best you can do at this point

644
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,080
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say operators may drop this if you</font>

645
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,610
insist on having a very long header or

646
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,000
if you insist on having a very long list

647
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:06,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">of headers you know be aware it may not</font>

648
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,070
work and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it at that</font>

649
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,470
to partly echo what Matt just said best

650
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,960
current practices and best current

651
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,090
operational practices described things

652
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,220
that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing they</font>

653
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,260
don't prescribe what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people should be</font>

654
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing except to the extent that everyone</font>

655
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,030
should be doing the best current

656
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,419
practice so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would think that</font>

657
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:32,178
the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we the next step if we</font>

658
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:34,960
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a problem is for operators</font>

659
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:38,539
to decide to start dropping them if that

660
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,919
occurs then we can describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the</font>

661
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:43,789
best current practices document but

662
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,830
otherwise I think trying to describe it

663
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:47,690
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone is doing it kind of makes</font>

664
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,889
a mockery of this being the best current

665
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,470
practice because it's not current

666
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,840
practice if I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump in for one second</font>

667
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:57,830
I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be two possibilities</font>

668
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:01,010
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bc o P here right one that Scott's</font>

669
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:03,918
talking about is the BTOP of dropping

670
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:06,919
packets that have a header chains longer

671
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,360
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> X bites right and it and again I</font>

672
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:10,010
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not something</font>

673
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,780
that's potentially potentially not

674
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,280
something that's in practice already so

675
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,020
perhaps documented as the best current

676
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,990
practice is unfeasible at this moment

677
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,990
but the other side is telling people not

678
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:23,299
to send packets with long header chains

679
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,460
is it is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the alternative dcop</font>

680
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:27,320
saying that there's hardware out there

681
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,130
that can't support this and so if you

682
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">send these packets they will probably</font>

683
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,790
be dropped not because of policy but

684
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:35,250
because of hardware and so the bc o P

685
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,560
would be the inverse which is don't send

686
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,410
packets with headers longer than<font color="#E5E5E5"> X I</font>

687
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:45,389
don't I don't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you not to send a</font>

688
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:47,370
prefix longer just last 24 and if you

689
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:50,580
ignore it and I drop it then I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

690
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:56,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you all I'll drop it you're welcome to</font>

691
00:32:50,580 --> 00:33:00,929
send it wouldn't stop you wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

692
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:03,600
of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um but Ron what happens</font>

693
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:07,830
to a ridiculously long<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanting some</font>

694
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,990
arbitrary vendors code today well not

695
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:18,480
speaking for any arbitrary vendor in

696
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:21,090
particular it's dropped sometimes

697
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,790
forwarded sometimes drop depends on the

698
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:28,820
hard telephone so the statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it</font>

699
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:31,700
it's not dropped today is false it's

700
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:36,060
certainly not forwarded ubiquitously

701
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:38,340
how's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for vendor dancing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I took my</font>

703
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:47,340
have some sympathy<font color="#E5E5E5"> run um the so</font>

704
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:50,340
therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think you know picking a</font>

705
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,919
rent a nice random number would be good

706
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,850
for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us it would send a message to</font>

707
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,930
the router vendors to support at least x

708
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,730
do you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're supporting</font>

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,850
else hear realize that if they make an

711
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:09,050
extension chain longer than X it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

712
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:12,629
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the other end</font>

713
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:14,760
right so wouldn't you like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a</font>

714
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:16,949
document with that number<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it that you</font>

715
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">could have to be somewhat confident that</font>

716
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:24,359
it would make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> around I would and you</font>

717
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,580
know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and the company I work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

718
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,010
it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much experience in</font>

719
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:36,509
ipv6 and

720
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:38,850
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would miss it so Warren</font>

721
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">kamari again it's the situation's</font>

722
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:44,460
actually even more interesting than that

723
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">in some hardware in some sets of devices</font>

724
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:51,060
if you create a filter that only allows

725
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,790
you know TCP port 80 as<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

726
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,168
there's an extension hitter which

727
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,660
appears between the IP header in the

728
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:00,480
upper payload the router just blindly

729
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,980
accepts it whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is put 80</font>

730
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,160
because I can't look far enough into it

731
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,530
so instead of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious safe-fail it</font>

732
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,920
just passes the packet lining in all

733
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:15,150
fairness Warren some hardware platforms

734
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,860
do that some blindly drop the packet it

735
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,800
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your favorite platform and</font>

736
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:23,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes depends on your</font>

737
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,460
favorite platform so yes I believe what

738
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,930
Randy is saying it would be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

739
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,580
if we all specified a number of bytes

740
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,480
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty sure as work works on</font>

741
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,480
everybody's platform

742
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,099
no I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> have have you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

743
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:51,510
asked the vendors of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment what</font>

744
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:54,119
they are doing Warren<font color="#CCCCCC"> kamari yes I have</font>

745
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,980
and the answer is complex because of

746
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,049
costs as with many things that depends

747
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,270
upon which line card which software

748
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:02,250
version which particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> engine is in</font>

749
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:05,190
the line card what the flavor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

750
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:08,069
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> main by phases and you don't</font>

751
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:12,030
ask answer well okay this is I'm not

752

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:24,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">damned vendors do we have consensus that</font>

755
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,309
it would be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to put a number</font>

756
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:31,230
on the wall that everybody should this

757
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:36,480
this is scott this sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like something</font>

for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp which means ietf not a bc o P</font>

purposes of getting around router

762
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,779
limitations and operators should have

763
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,129
input on whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be doing at</font>

764
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:52,500
which I think you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and I</font>

765
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,599

00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:13,230
no operator has any particular wish if

770
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:15,959
there is anybody who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

771
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,750
something specific and knows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

772
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,809
minimum requirements are that would be

773
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,789
really nice to be aired here and in the

774
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,990
idea agreed but I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

775
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:26,880
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get much more input</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than what</font>

776
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,848
you've gotten today from this community

777
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,230
so go do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp thing in the IETF and</font>

778
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:37,039
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to participate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

back one more yes title of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp so show</font>

as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcp we pick a number that we think</font>

is reasonable support in this room for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

784
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:03,350
good idea to do show of hands and that's

785
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:09,500
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me off the stage and us</font>

786
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:12,460
all on the way to a bar thank you Ron

and thank you for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback two runs</font>

00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:24,320
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we've got another</font>

789
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:27,290
new appeal this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be ipv6</font>

790
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,980
security myths and presented by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris</font>

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:50,630
alright thanks so what I've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

793
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is not prepared as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VCO p yet but</font>

794
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,980
I put together I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was asked to put</font>

795
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:57,349
together some slides on ipv6 security

796
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,800
myths at another conference a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font>

797
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:02,060
ago and figured that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 security in</font>

798
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,920
general was still kind of an unknown

799
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,810
quantity for a lot of folks but there

800
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">are experts out there who have laid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

801
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,549
some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good best current practices or</font>

802
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:14,060
our ideas on how to mitigate security in

803
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,960
ipv6 which is a many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are a</font>

804
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit different than I could before</font>

805
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,080
and so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do is just kind of</font>

806
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,910
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this slide deck</font>

807
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,470
much quicker<font color="#E5E5E5"> than it was meant to go</font>

808
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,319
through just going to highlight some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

809
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:27,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that I think are interesting</font>

810
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:30,230
that might make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into an rest in peace</font>

811
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:33,290
ELP and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for some</font>

812
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,550
conversation after that so one of the

813
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,320
first myths I think that comes up says

814
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,690
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not running activity six so I don't</font>

815
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,070
have to worry and debunking that I think

816
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,240
is important right there are

817
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,109
applications that already try to run

818
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">that could be six there's lot of</font>

819
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:48,140
tunneling mechanisms there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

820
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,820
reasons why it is not true that just not

821
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,660
turning on ipv6 keeps you protected<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

822
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:55,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">my 36 so that would be one piece of the</font>

823
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,319
bc o P right that protecting against

824
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:58,970
ipv6 is now something you have to do

825
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,960
regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether or not you think</font>

826
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:04,279
you're running activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

827
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,280
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> big one that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think a lot of</font>

828
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:11,150
people still propagate is that ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

829
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,460
security designed into it and the truth

830
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that you know ipsec maybe it was</font>

831
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">written for corrective v6 originally but</font>

832
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,399
it's been back for two<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor before and</font>

833
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:21,799
the fact that I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be six mandates</font>

834
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,300
ipsec as being available doesn't mean

835
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,540
that you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it necessarily</font>

836
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,490
so there's obviously some room for bc

837
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">op's around you know actually using</font>

838
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">IPSec and actually using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools that</font>

839
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">are provided in I could be six because</font>

840
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:38,000
otherwise it doesn't actually provide

841
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:40,460
any more security right another piece is

842
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,650
that type of v6 is already fairly long

843
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,990
in the tooth even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is just now</font>

844
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,460
being deployed one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

845
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,830
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about is extension headers</font>

846
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:52,339
right so I think I'll gloss over some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

847
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,828
this because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of problems</font>

848
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,619
with extension

849
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:58,140
others that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think can go into security</font>

850
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:59,880
obviously the rh 0 is the big one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

851
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">think most folks know about it has been</font>

852
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,749
deprecated but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there still may be some</font>

853
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,680
operational practices around ensuring

854
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:11,069
that old gear that still can use it

855
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop by hop options header</font>

856
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:16,170
again is another extension header that's

857
00:41:13,229 --> 00:41:19,019
you know kind of inherently<font color="#E5E5E5"> evil in some</font>

858
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,430
ways if you want to use you know use it

859
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:23,788
to do low bandwidth denial service

860
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,618
attacks and again there's there's an ITF

861
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:27,869
draft on that threat but again

862
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:32,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">mitigating it may be a good piece of a</font>

863
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:33,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">vco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> p and then kind of what the last</font>

864
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation was about specifically</font>

865
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:36,749
which is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that you know</font>

866
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">using huge extension headers or lots of</font>

867
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:39,419
extension headers or invalid extension

868
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:41,279
headers can cause all kinds of neat

869
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:44,999
problems on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on routers and switches</font>

870
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:48,599
across the board and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> another piece</font>

871
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:51,808
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is separate is router</font>

872
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,430
advertisements right so if you someone

873
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:56,039
has physical access to the network they

874
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:59,118
can use neighbor discovery to do some

875
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,049
fun things with ree numbering hosts

876
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,239
redirecting packets to themselves to

877
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:04,499
become a man in the middle and again

878
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,709
there isn't our see that documents the

879
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:09,238
threat but perhaps a bc of p that

880
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:13,259
outlines how to mitigate the threat in

881
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:15,269
your network would be good because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

882
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:17,180
RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> does list some some possible</font>

883
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:19,229
solutions but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're getting</font>

884
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,640
actual operator feedback on which

885
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:22,709
solutions are working and<font color="#CCCCCC"> which ones</font>

886
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,180
working which scenarios and maybe even

887
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:25,558
some configuration examples of how to do

888
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:30,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">this across you know various types of</font>

889
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:32,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">equipment would be interesting and then</font>

890
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,959
beyond just the router advertisements

891
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:36,029
for genever discovery in general and

892
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:41,279
then there's ICMP redirects which work

893
00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:43,920
just like I 34 redirects another piece

894
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:46,499
that may be worth mentioning in ABC<font color="#E5E5E5"> o P</font>

895
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,829
about ipv6 security is that changing

896
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:51,180
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 to ipv6 doesn't do anything to</font>

897
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:52,849
a lot of attacks because they have

898
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:58,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the IP layer at all</font>

899
00:42:52,849 --> 00:43:00,390
so just that as a reminder another piece

900
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:01,649
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transition from ipv4 to ipv6 as</font>

901
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,239
far as security is concerned is there's

902
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">still a lot of folks who will tell you</font>

903
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:08,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't have NAT</font>

904
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:12,320
on your ipv6 router for your<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise</font>

905
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:14,549
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home you've lost security so</font>

906
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,130
confidently stating that somewhere they

907
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,290
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pointed to may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be important to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Stateville</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> firewalls are the answer not</font>

909
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:27,450
NAT and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> network scanning is another</font>

910
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,310
big piece that again I hear this a lot

911
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:32,220
that oh well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you've got 18</font>

912
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:34,370
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 180 octillion addresses on your</font>

913
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,470
land so there's no way it can be scanned

914
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,990
and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very smart security</font>

915
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,209
researchers that have shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to be</font>

916
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:43,890
complete malarkey there's a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

917
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways that I could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six sub that's can</font>

918
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:48,150
be scanned mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the way</font>

919
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,400
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are deploying ipv6 networks right</font>

920
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:53,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if you use DHCP and you just number</font>

921
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,570
sequentially from the bottom well I can

922
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,950
still scan the first hundred or Hearst

923
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:58,710
thousand addresses it doesn't medica 8

924
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:00,750
180 octillion addresses in your / 64 if

925
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:05,450
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only used colon colon 10 through</font>

926
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:08,580
colon colon 100 also slack addresses are

927
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:11,270
introducing the mac address right so you

928
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,319
can search for specific vendor types

929
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:15,540
that narrows<font color="#E5E5E5"> you down quite a bit if</font>

930
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:19,080
you're looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

931
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,420
type of vendor and then also there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64</font>

932
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,850
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> snap trade all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tunneling uses well</font>

933
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,290
known addresses which allows you again

934
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:28,049
another area to focus in on if you're

935
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:29,220
doing network scanning and then manually

936
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,080
configured addresses so all the

937
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,180
addresses that spell names and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the do</font>

938
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,670
fun things like that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get scanned</font>

939
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,740
fairly easily and then once you've got

940
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,620
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a local node you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font>

941
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,700
multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> I neighbor discovery to find</font>

942
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,529
everyone else so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do is</font>

943
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,620
find one address right so the server

944
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,240
that's colon colon<font color="#CCCCCC"> deadbeef or whatever</font>

945
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,819
now has given you access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the entire</font>

946
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,399
network once<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once you've</font>

947
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:54,720
exploited that one device I mean there's

948
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,790
also application layer protocols that

949
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,810
can leak out addresses that again give

950
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:01,020
you that one address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

951
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:04,110
leverage into the network our privacy

952
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:08,009
addresses is one potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution to</font>

953
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:09,630
this problem but there's again that

954
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,970
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> even a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole separate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vco p on how</font>

955
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:14,640
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> them when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use them how</font>

956
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:22,980
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors have implemented them</font>

957
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:24,150
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like and then this</font>

958
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,400
part just talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

959
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,200
tools that are already available so

960
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,910
again plenty of information out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to</font>

961
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,180
reference into a bcfe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

962
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:36,029
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work has been done as far as</font>

963
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:39,720
determining where the vco p would lie

964
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:43,109
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't been kind of brought into</font>

965
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:46,379
one area the last piece here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

966
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:49,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is one of the last myths is that</font>

967
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,900
there are some fairly major differences

968
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,940
actually between<font color="#E5E5E5"> actively</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4936 it right</font>

969
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,730
it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> 96 more bits it's not just</font>

970
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,980
a longer address if you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

971
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,950
like acl's and things right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

972
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,569
doing anything in systematically right

973
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:07,109
in your searching for 32-bit addresses

974
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:08,519
with periods in them those searches no

975
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:09,990
longer work if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for every</font>

976
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">six addresses right now you need 128</font>

977
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,348
bits and colons there's hex characters

978
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,118
in there which<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw off all kinds</font>

979
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:17,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things so if you're doing logging</font>

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,130
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> groping filters or writing filters</font>

981
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,809
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> groping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logs there's lots of issues</font>

982
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:25,230
there that are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different</font>

983
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:26,630
now that we may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to document like</font>

984
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,309
having multiple addresses on each host

985
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,779
so again from a log in perspective and

986
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:32,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">how do you parse logs and how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

987
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:34,980
identify users and how you identify

988
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,049
sources and destinations of attacks you

989
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:43,559
can move addresses and not move hosts

990
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:46,769
right and then the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

991
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,529
configured kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> parlaying off of that</font>

992
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:51,328
is ipv6 filters I hear over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and over</font>

993
00:46:49,529 --> 00:46:52,740
again they just you know configure your

994
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:54,359
v6 filters just like every<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

995
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:58,348
filters and you'll be fine but that's

996
00:46:54,359 --> 00:47:00,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">not quite true icmp is actually required</font>

997
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:01,440
frightened v6 to operate right so then

998
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,599
that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be for a lot of times you</font>

999
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,180
just block all of it and if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1000
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:10,140
in a QV six you will break neighbor

1003
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:21,710

there aren't any security<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs I think</font>

1008
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:35,569
we could rectify that there are some but

a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very broad very general</font>

1013
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,950
good but I think having some focused

operational experience written down

1015
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,600
would make sense so at that point i'd

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open it up and see if any of</font>

Jeff handle louisiana state university

1021
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:13,440
there were several slides you had on

1022
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,810
there about not tracking or not worrying

1023
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,430
about tracking but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us tracking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1024
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,560
very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still need to know who</font>

they're doing so how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looking to</font>

1030

<font color="#E5E5E5">should be explored further</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

1031
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,090
depends right on your environment i

1032
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:38,250
think but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more from a</font>

1033
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:40,290
security perspective of not necessarily

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to track the user's but</font>

1035
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:43,680
the idea that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find them right if</font>

1036
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,450
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a JCP pool because you</font>

1037
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the HTTP and you have a</font>

block of addresses you're going to

1039
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:50,850
assign your clients then that block is

1040
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,250
exploitable potentially and it's not

1041
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:55,350
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's any less secure than I could</font>

1042
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:57,270
before which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think people some</font>

1043
00:48:55,350 --> 00:49:02,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the documents that are there as</font>

00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:04,830
interpreted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my security department</font>

1045
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,960
come back to me as an operator as

1046
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,960
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks very brain damaged</font>

1047
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:14,910
that's fair and to those last two points

1048
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:16,410
I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> track</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1049

slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I had available to me that I</font>

1051
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:21,839
used kind of expediently so yeah I

1052
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:24,570
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest that the BTOP itself</font>

1053
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,460
was a mythbuster but that using some of

1054
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:29,460
the the busted myths as a place to start

1055
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,290
with and I also believe there is someone

1056
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:33,570
in that security track who may have some

1057
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:35,370
of this already written down as a place

1058
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,270
to start with so just looking for you

1059
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:45,500
know feedback on whether or not to

the internet society came here and

<font color="#CCCCCC">talked to you about a global best</font>

00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:25,308
basically the idea that originated here

00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:27,140
in North America where you're

00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,460
was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go around to other operator</font>

1078
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:42,500
groups around the world and talk to them

about putting together similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> efforts</font>

already<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists in some of the other</font>

regions but just not in a very formal

way but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aim was and and by</font>

00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:38,720
groups and creating this global series

1128
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:40,880
well we didn't hear what we expected to

1129
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,040
hear when we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and we talked to</font>

1130
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,960
everyone now one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we</font>

1131
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">did is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Society is we</font>

1132
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,800
decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an operator</font>

1133
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,320
that actually helped us build this work

1134
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,550
inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Society and we</font>

1135
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,920
brought on an operator we brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to all of you but I'm stepping in for</font>

1139
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:04,550
him and describing what's happened over

<font color="#E5E5E5">the last couple of months and the</font>

00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,800
we've talked to have said we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with the</font>

1145
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,170

00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want you putting together some</font>

brings these documents into the ITF

00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,180
we've heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> loud and clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1151
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,680

most recently in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right community</font>

1154
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:38,360
where there was a ball on this topic

1155
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:40,160
that there there's very little interest

1156
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,830
in coming straight out of the gate and

1157
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,759
creating an actual global process a

1158
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:48,799
process heavy top-down sort of system

1159
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,950
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could recognize these documents</font>

1160
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,300
and instead they've asked us to do a few

1161
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:56,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1162
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,130
changing our strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> yonder's inside</font>

1163
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00,530
the internet society organization has

1164
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,760
said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we set out to do</font>

1165
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in the very beginning couple of</font>

1166
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,420
months ago was probably wrong and he's

1167
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,220
actually convinced us to change pace a

1168
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,660
little bit so what we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1169
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,700
doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet society with this</font>

1170
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,020
is we're certainly not dropping interest

1171
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,240
in best current operational practices

1172
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,100
we're very interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we think</font>

1173
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,709
they're very important there are

1174
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:20,630
hundreds or thousands of operators or

1175
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:23,420
thousands of operators around the globe

1176
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:25,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not participate in events like</font>

this one they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to write meetings</font>

they don't go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analogue matings</font>

1179
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:31,700
it's either a resource issue or it's a

1180
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,960
knowledge issue or there might be

1181
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,240
something else that's standing in the

1182
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,960
way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simply don't participate we</font>

00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,109
to have the benefit of these best

00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:36,020
going to do is simply start documenting

in the future if the operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask us to</font>

00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:50,960
do it then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> put together something</font>
