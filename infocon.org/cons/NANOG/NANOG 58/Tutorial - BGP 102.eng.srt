1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,230
nice piece from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous section</font>

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,250
from a previous section we haven't

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:20,680
discussed about specific community rules

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,240
that some of the recipes have applied so

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,460
we'll discuss that before continuing

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,839
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one but first I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> review</font>

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,849
the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this section so first</font>

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,710
we'll discuss after discussing the

9
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:36,879
communities will discuss the role of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">gps and ibgp aggregation which is very</font>

11
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,608
important for the health of the internet

12
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:45,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss that in more detail</font>

13
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:49,089
receiving prefixes from peers customers

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:53,949
and transit providers origin validation

15
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:57,219
of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> keiki I for security verifying</font>

16
00:00:53,949 --> 00:01:02,409
that the prefix received is originated

17
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:04,920
from from from the originator from an

18
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:07,510
authenticator Ajah Ajah net originator

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,870
and then we'll discuss about preparing

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,940
the network and some configuration tips

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:17,880
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that will i'll review some of</font>

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:21,370
the customer so this is P committee

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:27,990
rules what types of words they use here

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:33,430
is an example for sprint so in this case

25
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:37,020
sprint uses different s numbers the

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:40,210
first using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sched 500 range to</font>

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,560
influence<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so that the customers can</font>

28
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:49,149
tell sprint how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> s's sprint can</font>

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:53,680
prepend to the AAS pass so if a customer

30
00:01:49,150 --> 00:02:02,130
wants sprint to prepend for example for

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">SNS nw6 500 for to a specific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SI so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">5,400 1500 signifies all transits 5415</font>

60

01 signifies transiting through sprint

61

and another one 1502 transiting through

62
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,590
service and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how they</font>

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:11,510
communicate to their circuit to their

transits receivers what those prefixes

are so the previous out there that was

66
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,640
privy to those transit receivers so here

67
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:23,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">is another one for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> labor three so you</font>

68
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,740
can review it but you can go to each of

69
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,400
these websites<font color="#CCCCCC"> and two other service</font>

provider and see what has come<font color="#CCCCCC"> unities</font>

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,859
to communicate routing a tree with

72
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:38,120
decisions between the service provider

73
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:45,030
and their partners<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pierce customers and</font>

74
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:56,970
transit receivers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay getting back to</font>

75
00:04:45,030 --> 00:05:00,150
the the main station here first we'll

76
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,250
discuss the role of igp same IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS what</font>

77
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:07,520
when to use each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and when</font>

78
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:10,680
not to use the importance of aggregation

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:15,000
receiving prefixes from different

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:19,380
entities using original addition to make

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,139
sure that the route received from a

82
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,469
specific origin is really an

83
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,020
authenticated origin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll see the</font>

84
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,349
reason why that's important preparing

85
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:35,370
the network and computation tips so the

86
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:38,550
role of idea I GPS and I bgp so first

87
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,260
let's discuss bgp versus ospf ISS ospf

88
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,720
and I a size of the main IP protocols

89
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,250
used in service providers so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDPs</font>

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">lies on the space they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carry</font>

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,460
infrastructure addresses like interface

92
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,880
addresses newpark IP addresses and so on

93
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,349
within the service provider network they

94
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,740
are not used to carry customer addresses

95
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:09,719
and they are not used to carry obviously

96
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:14,130
other service provider prefixes so the

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:17,479
design goal is to minimize the load on I

98
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:21,990
GP so that I GP converges faster because

99
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:25,800
bgp recursos into<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP so it depends on</font>

100
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:29,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">igp so a fast converging IGP me is also</font>

101
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,360
important for bgp convergence

102
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:39,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> internally you can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP using</font>

103
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:44,080
obviously ibgp and then externally using

104
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:50,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bgp so I BGP for internal use is used</font>

105
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:53,620
to carry customer prefixes also some

106
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,610
internal prefixes particularly towards

107
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,680
the edge for edge devices instead of

108
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:04,930
carrying them in I GPU<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't carry them</font>

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:09,940
in BGP in ibgp but the prefixes that you

110
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:13,270
carry in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibgp does not necessarily go to</font>

111
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:18,010
your ebgp updates and usually they don't

112
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:19,900
and we'll discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> that also so ebgp is</font>

113
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:23,409
used to exchange prefixes with other

114
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">aces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you also apply out in policy</font>

115
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:29,380
there so again to review the model you

116
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:33,969
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP within a network and</font>

117
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:38,260
then ebgp between networks very

118
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:42,220
important to note<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is very important</font>

119
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to distribute BGP into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP also not</font>

120
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:52,620
to distribute igp into PGP it is do not

121
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,330
use also<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP to carry customer prefixes</font>

122
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,270
it's very important to inject customer

123
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,729
prefix into<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP because you want to</font>

124
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:08,530
reduce the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP so that I</font>

125
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:10,150
typical values faster so this these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

126
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">very important so how do we inject</font>

127
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,250
routes into BGP and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss that</font>

128
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:20,099
later on but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> by distributing</font>

129
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">igp into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP you have to inject specific</font>

130
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:28,330
prefixes using network statements and

131
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,570
static browse instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just resulting</font>

132
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,570
routes

133
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,969
so again use ibgp to carry customer

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,719
prefixes customer prefix of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp</font>

135
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:47,529
sensually you can point a static route

136
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:50,880
to the customer interface or you may

137
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:54,160
even depending on scenario you may even

138
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,670
create a floating static point starts

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,890
crowd that will not go away even if the

140
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,719
customer interface goes down you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

141
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,000
want that to propagate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the rest of</font>

142
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">senator obviously you don't distribute</font>

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,829
customer prefix directly to your ebgp

144
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,079
peers you only use this for your

145
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:17,079
internal arousing purpose for your

146
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:21,250
internal table so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject</font>

148
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,430
right into bgp you can use network

149
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,680
segments as well but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you distribute</font>

150
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,120
into your ebgp you have to make sure

151
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,370
that you are only are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

152
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,230
advertising<font color="#E5E5E5"> or aggregate prefixes you</font>

153
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:42,370
don't want to advertise specific

154
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:45,540
prefixes for customers typically you

155
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,070
don't run ebgp bgp with your customers

156
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,219
but if you have a big customer that's

157
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:55,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">spilling with you at multiple locations</font>

158
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,970
or that's connected with your network at

159
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,980
multiple locations it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

160
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of routing protocol and</font>

161
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:08,050
bgp is a better it is better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than other</font>

162
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:11,319
protocols for that purpose so in that

163
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:15,609
case is it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use bgp with the</font>

164
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:18,430
customer exchange recipes using bgp with

165
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,670
the customer so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two scenarios</font>

166
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:25,420
it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefixes are from</font>

167
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:27,370
your own prefixes so you assign those

168
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,019
professions a customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> even that gets</font>

169
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,640
important to exchange odds with a cust

170
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,949
with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer if you are</font>

171
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,720
peering at multiple locations or connect

172
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:39,609
if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer is connected at multiple</font>

173
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,770
locations the other scenario is if the

174
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,590
customer is peeling not just with you

175
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:48,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">but with other service providers</font>

176
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:51,090
if it has its own address space it's

177
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:55,120
important to exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourselves as well</font>

178
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:58,000
so but in that case those routes those

179
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,940
prefix are assigned directly to that

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,940
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> port to that customer you don't</font>

181
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,440
want to advertise a prefix assigned to

182
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,060
that customer from another service

183
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:13,890
provider to another service provider you

184
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:17,619
only advertise or receive advertisements

185
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:20,260
prefixes assigned to that selves to that

186
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:24,480
customer either from your other space or

187
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,480
directly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer from a registry</font>

188
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:37,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so aggregation so if you notice the</font>

189
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,950
question here quality or quantity when

190
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:45,760
you aggregate you are reducing the size

191
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:47,650
of the your routing table and improving

192
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality of the Internet in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general</font>

193
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,709
and we'll see the reason why when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

194
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,090
advertise specific routes you are

195
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:59,040
increasing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> size of the Internet</font>

196
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:02,530
table you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve some level of</font>

197
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,310
traffic engineering but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other</font>

198
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:08,530
ways to achieve that so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

199
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:11,650
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> or advisable to send specific</font>

200
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:14,110
routes that are not aggregated from

201
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:18,280
customers to the rest of the network so

202
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:21,400
aggregation is very important so

203
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,250
aggregation means basically advertising

204
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:29,079
blocks received directly from registry

205
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:34,230
or received through the standard class

206
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:38,710
based on location which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> rare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

207
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:42,400
so sub prefixes of the registry assign

208
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:44,200
addresses can be advertised to some

209
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,390
service providers for interaction during

210
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,590
purpose but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it shouldn't be propagated</font>

211
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:53,770
to the rest of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

212
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:56,350
advertised to some service providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

213
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreement and then it's important that</font>

214
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,620
those are wise do not

215
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,199
of sequential advertise<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other service</font>

216
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:06,370
providers only the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye which should be</font>

217
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:10,470
advertised it again this is important

218
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,470
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stability of the whole internet</font>

219
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,500
but as you will see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the numbers</font>

220
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:20,860
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise more specific</font>

221
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,720
prefixes on there is three entries so

222
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,230
the registries are normally / 22 and

223
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:37,960
lower but you will see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of / 20</font>

224
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:40,750
force on the internet again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so profuse</font>

225
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,880
should not be advertiser to the rest of

226
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,940
the network they made our size to some

227
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:54,250
service providers for traffic

228
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:56,770
engineering purpose and usually we'll

229
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,460
see some of there are some tools and

230
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:04,000
websites that are tracking the prefixes

231
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,790
and some of the service providers who

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,280
are not complying are normally regarded

233
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:14,140
poorly by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community and we'll see</font>

234
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,220
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those and you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

235
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:21,250
reports for yourself registries

236
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:26,440
published there a minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> and location</font>

237
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:28,360
size and it ranged from / 20 22 / 22 in

238
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,700
some cases there are / 20 force because

239
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:37,000
we are we are running out of address

240
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:42,970
space the ipv4 address space here is a

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,860
bad example let's say is 100 has a

242
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:50,710
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> has assigned IP address from</font>

243
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,660
its own other space to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer</font>

244
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:58,690
which is a /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 so it has a / 19 a sign</font>

245
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:02,430
from registry and it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a signed / 23</font>

246
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:05,890
to its cus to one of the its customers

247
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,290
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we tie / title / 23 to add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

248
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:12,240
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet that's really a bad</font>

249
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,240
example and creates a problem

250
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:21,689
so why suppose the customer link goes

251
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:24,689
down what happens and the customer link

252
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:27,720
goes down that<font color="#CCCCCC"> route will be withdrawn</font>

253
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,480
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

254
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,040
service provider will withdraw that from

255
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that will</font>

256
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,509
propagates routes throughout the

257
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,360
internet and when the link comes the

258
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:41,160
back later on the service provider

259
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,230
advertise that route so in the customer

260
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,939
advertise that route to the service

261
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,069
provider and then the service provider

262
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,990
advertise that route<font color="#CCCCCC"> again to the rest</font>

263
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:55,349
of the internet and then second time

264
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:57,060
calls another turn to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so</font>

265
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,389
when that adds up from multiple service

266
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:03,540
providers it creates a lot of churn to

267
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:07,019
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason that's</font>

268
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,349
that's one of the reasons why it's

269
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,060
important not to advertise the customer

270
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,800
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned to the customer</font>

271
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,459
to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet you can just</font>

272
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:20,479
assign the / 19<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the rest of the</font>

273
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:24,420
internet but in some cases maybe just

274
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,480
maybe / 24 Trac engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> purpose but</font>

275
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,510
it's not really important necessary to

276
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:35,399
advertise the customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> as prefixed to</font>

277
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:40,139
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet here is a good</font>

278
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:45,810
example the again the s100 has assigned

279
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:49,139
/ 23 but only advertising / 19 so when

280
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:51,209
the route goes down when the customer /

281
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,839
19<font color="#CCCCCC"> rothko's Donald the interface goes</font>

282
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:57,209
down the rouses was drawn from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s</font>

283
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,980
100 the service provider but nothing

284
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:02,699
helps to topless to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

285
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:07,559
internet the the impact is only to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zack</font>

286
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:10,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nader so if you think about it even for</font>

287
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:12,089
the customer in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous case for</font>

288
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:14,909
the customer to receive traffic from the

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">rest of the network that prefix has to</font>

290
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,990
probe to propagate throughout the

00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,079
network before to receives traffic for

292
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,150
that prefix but in this case since

293
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:30,389
nothing is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the internet and</font>

294
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:32,550
coming to that prefix anyways since

295
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,570
trucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming to that prefix and getting</font>

296
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:38,610
dropped at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upstream is P which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AI</font>

297
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,770
spear hundred when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trap is</font>

298
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,290
advertised the customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> will receive</font>

299
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,450
traffic quickly so it's good for the

300
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:53,760
customer it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

301
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:56,190
internet so good example is what

302
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:01,770
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do but for different</font>

303
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:04,460
reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't happen and normally</font>

304
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:10,110
it is for lack of understanding of how

305
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:17,790
the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the volume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in some</font>

306
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:25,919
cases just disregard for the poor

307
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:27,720
knowledge essentially so another very

308
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,090
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's very important</font>

309
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,360
to separate routes with an ibgp and

310
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,449
routers that are sent across ebgp that's

311
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,100
that we remain with ibgp includes

312
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,310
customer prefixes some of the

313
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:45,330
infrastructures even that are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

314
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:47,909
core are in ibgp but you don't advertise

315
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:53,790
those two ebgp only advertise the

316
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:55,500
aggregate<font color="#CCCCCC"> other space and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

317
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to detract injuring bid on a customer</font>

318
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,030
prefix if you want to do traffic

319
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:04,379
engineering you should sighs we should

320
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">create other sub prefixes and then split</font>

321
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,250
them across multiple service providers

322
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,740
or upstream providers instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

323
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,410
directly the customer prefix by doing

324
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is making the network stable</font>

325
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,220
because those prefix will remain active

326
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:24,650
because they are being advertised for

327
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:24,650
multiple points so kids from a year ago

328
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:32,850
so the BGP table cells will see some of

329
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:37,250
the today's numbers later on the it's

330
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:39,860
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 45,000 for 450 thousand plus</font>

331
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:44,180
on the internet but a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago it was 42</font>

332
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,879
up 420,000 Internet routing table and

333
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,610
they and if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> side or aggregation</font>

334
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,650
based on insider<font color="#E5E5E5"> outer space you can</font>

335
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:57,590
reduce it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for 243 if he is aggregated</font>

336
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:03,320
using a maximum aggregation mechanism it

337
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">can even go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down to 180 1000 so you can</font>

338
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,169
see that it can the current table can

339
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:13,040
easily be aggregated to be more

340
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:17,810
efficient which is as a 250 or 180,000

341
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,340
but it was 420,000 last year so the same

342
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:25,580
proportion pretty much remains the same

343
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:27,889
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this year's around 450,000 but</font>

344
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,120
what this shows you is a number of

345
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,840
service providers are not really

346
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:40,060
aggregating based on the cider or the

347
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:43,780
registries<font color="#CCCCCC"> science and as you can see</font>

348
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:47,030
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some other spaces that are</font>

349
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:50,350
producing a lot of prefixes so if you

350
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this table this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is from 1999</font>

351
00:20:50,350 --> 00:21:01,459
1999 the 24 / 8 and some of the 192 / 8

352
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,340
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 192 / 8 was the one</font>

353
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:10,900
that was generating a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

354
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:14,840
prefixes which was six thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> / / 8</font>

355
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:22,700
but in 2010 that has changed

356
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:24,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">significantly and 64 / 8 26 / 8 and 74 /</font>

357
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,530
18 zones the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that are highlighted</font>

358
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">are generating a lot more prefixes part</font>

359
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:34,360
/ 8 so this has they're called the new

360
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,360
swamps

361
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:51,050
so the 120 20 rirs combined if they

362
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:52,879
generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5000 prefixes / / 8 will</font>

363
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:58,159
increase the routing the Internet

364
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:03,230
routing table to over 600 35,000 if that

365
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:05,300
number goes to 6000<font color="#E5E5E5"> per / 8 as per the</font>

366
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:16,280
trend the internet browsing table may go

367
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:19,970
to 700 skis 2000 and so on so why is the

368
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">noosa swamp so solve the reasons our</font>

369
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:29,630
lack of knowledge in some cases just not

370
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:31,429
being no laziness essentially in some

371
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:36,680
cases they know it but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is</font>

372
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:43,880
necessary and they do it so if first to

373
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:47,330
improve there was some<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiative that</font>

374
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,970
was done early on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started by Tony and</font>

375
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,120
then revised by<font color="#E5E5E5"> phillip smith and</font>

376
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:56,600
philippson is used to deliver this

377
00:22:52,120 --> 00:23:00,500
presentation Charlie and now combined

378
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,439
with jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> Houston there's a cider report</font>

379
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,460
you can go there and check that

380
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:13,760
different reports and we'll see some of

381
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">them here so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it computes the size of the</font>

382
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,200
routing table assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> is peace perform</font>

383
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,860
optimal aggregation and compare it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

384
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,950
what it is without that autumn

385
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:33,919
allegation so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at the next</font>

386
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:39,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">table here this is from yesterday or its</font>

387
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,540
from yesterday so you can see that so

388
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:46,550
it's not fully visible but you can see

389
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:49,399
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the prefixes current prefixes</font>

390
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,790
total prefix on the internet are 450

391
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,300
7,000 plus

392
00:23:51,790 --> 00:24:01,120
but if they were side or aggregated that

393
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:10,520
would have been reduced to 261,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

394
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:16,639
so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> summary there are 44 thousand SS</font>

395
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:18,530
in the routing system but only eighteen

396
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,950
thousand of them announce one prefix

397
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:27,740
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced multiple prefixes to</font>

398
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:29,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and 3000 is the largest</font>

399
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,350
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of prefix announced by a single s</font>

400
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,480
and that spells out and you will see

401
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:39,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> report on the next one so here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

402
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,910
ranking of biblically who is advertising

403
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,800
more prefixes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and as you</font>

404
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:49,780
can see it's Ben's house and it was

405
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:53,210
Ben's house last year also spells out

406
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:59,660
advertising<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3000 and the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font>

407
00:24:53,210 --> 00:25:02,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nate services for 27th 2700 and so on we</font>

408
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:13,970
consider ranking so you can see this

409
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:17,139
ranking for any day so this is per

410
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:20,150
origin s the the previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> one was what</font>

411
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:28,660
what was announced it again also /

412
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:31,190
origin s builds houses the largest and

413
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,980
then who is advertising more specific

414
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,230
prefixes than what is provided to them

415
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:41,110
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see it is still Ben's house</font>

416
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:46,720
but the others change<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit and</font>

417
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:49,699
here the heels of aggregation suggestion

418
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,330
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed on dialysis the tool does</font>

419
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:56,450
analysis and then suggested what should

420
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:59,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">be added and what should be removed so</font>

421
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:03,170
the red ones are what is suggested to be

422
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:04,480
removed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the green ones the aggregate</font>

423
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,630
prefix

424
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,080
so the tool does really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good job of</font>

425
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:18,610
analyzing it and suggesting aggregation

426
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:20,320
alternatives so importance of size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

427
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,189
routing table so it's very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

428
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:28,149
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that today memory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

429
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:32,460
issue so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have millions of</font>

430
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:35,230
frauds most of the routers that are

431
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:39,630
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> today they can do millions of</font>

432
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">rods so that's not the main issue even</font>

433
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:46,660
CPU has also increased significantly

434
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:54,340
there's a lot of CPU but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

435
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:57,220
time there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a significant expectation</font>

436
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,949
that bgp should converge faster faster

437
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:05,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">than it used to so if you want to</font>

438
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:10,390
converge<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP faster with large number of</font>

439
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:12,220
routes even if you have large memory so

440
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,580
the memory doesn't really influence the

441
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,110
convergence it is a CPU so the size is

442
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,299
not only because of the memory issue

443
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:23,049
it's mostly because the convergence

444
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:24,400
issue the expectation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP needs to</font>

445
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:26,770
converge faster because there are lots

446
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,900
of applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend heavily on</font>

447
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> convergence of the network in</font>

448
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:35,919
general so it's important to that p-gp

449
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:40,090
converges faster and to do that you have

450
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,460
two things to play with one you can

451
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:46,260
reduce the size of the bgp table and

452
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:49,540
second one is you can increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu and</font>

453
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,490
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu has been increasing the</font>

454
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:55,240
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the expectation of convergence</font>

455
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:56,919
has been also getting higher but the

456
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,700
size of the beach be table has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

457
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:04,770
increasing but it's important still to

458
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:07,720
make sure that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will follow the</font>

459
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:12,150
guidelines and reduce the bgp table size

460
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,150
so that the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> convergence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> faster</font>

461
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:25,049

515
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,360
those prefixes to the customer than the

516
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,980
customer can avert isaam and it's useful

517
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,080
particularly if the customer is

518
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,790
connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service provider at</font>

519
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:10,168
multiple points and it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

redundancy as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as load balancing</font>

521
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:19,900
also if the customer has received an

522
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:22,750
assigned IP address or IP address block

523
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,720
from a registry then the customer can

524
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,700
advertise it to multiple service

525
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,799
providers because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this explicitly</font>

526
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:36,460
assigned to that isp to that customer

527
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:37,360
and also has its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> s number you can</font>

528
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,720
check

529
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,949
who all's specific prefix using the who

530
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:49,140
is to basically here is one example this

531
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:55,330
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> example is checking the</font>

532

<font color="#CCCCCC">prefix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plunder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 1220 90 on the ethnic</font>

533
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:01,720
database the registry and it shows that

534
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:15,668
is assigned and supportable which means

535
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:17,590
can be used and here in this case you

536
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:19,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see that these are located</font>

538
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:25,210
assigned by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front from the service</font>

539
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:27,309

540
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:30,460
can use who is to check whether a

00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:32,260
specific prefix has been assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

542
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,960
customer if the customer sites i have an

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:42,910
IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address that i assume for my registry</font>

544
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:45,340
is important to check it what I was from

545
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,049
appear from appeal it depends on the

546
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:50,439
argument usually there's a bilateral

547
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:55,660
agreement between peers or they may be

548
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:58,770
some in the public paying scenario there

549
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:02,200
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some you have to verify that the</font>

550
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:05,860
prefix is assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that service</font>

551
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:13,168
provider or to its customers before you

552
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:16,089
can exchange those prefixes typically so

553
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:18,158
so when you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get into an</font>

554
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:21,490
agreement you can exchange emails and

555
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,770
document them you can also check<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

556
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:28,479

mechanism use origin s validation which

00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,990
we'll discuss later on

561
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:52,339
from upstream service providers usually

562
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,500
you have couple of few alternatives if

563
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,540
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering with multiple service</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">getting transits from multiple service</font>

565
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,759
providers you can receive the full table

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:10,350
from each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them usually that's</font>

567
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:13,440
costly if you are receiving if you are

just point a defaulter to that service

602
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,220
in summary it's important to pay

603
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,740
attention what types of prefixes you are

604

as well as from transit providers this

606
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,060
it's important for the integrity of your

610
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:34,240
involved with receiving prefixes and

611
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">rotating prefixes we will see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

612
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,560
specific cases where it caused a

613
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:45,220
significant outage to the internet and

614
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:50,220
how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use origin validation to fix</font>

615
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:53,700
that problem i'll go specifically to

616
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,779
this example so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> well documented</font>

617
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:00,069
example and we will see the specific

618
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:11,530
case take the following scenario let's

619
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:15,040
say there's a client there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ss20</font>

620
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:19,030
and s40 advertise the same prefix let's

621
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:23,980
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> s belongs to s 20 legislatively</font>

622
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:27,310
belongs to s 20 sorry s40 but both s 20

623
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:30,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> s40 advertise the same prefix by</font>

624
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:35,710
default<font color="#E5E5E5"> because as 20 is a shorter path</font>

625
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:38,379
train will be picked so unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

626
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,920
a mechanism to verify that s 20 all that

627
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:45,180
prefix and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that s 10 blocks</font>

628
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:49,150
that prefix listing from s 20 then

629
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:51,850
traffic coming from the clan to that

630
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:55,900
prefix will go through a s 20 and may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

631
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:59,650
blocked or dropped somewhere so this is

632
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">one kids gives another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

633
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:07,570
same even if the s pass is shorter if

634
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,509
somebody advertise a more specific route

635
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,000
of that prefix then track will go to the

636
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,430
more space

637
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be proud even if that part is longer</font>

638
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:20,930
parts and traffic will be blackened

639
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:23,780
because of that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was one such case</font>

640
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:32,419
few years back think about three years

641
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:36,830
ago what happened was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pakistan telecom</font>

642
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:39,170
advertise it Yahoo's sorry YouTube's

643
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:42,890
prefix more specific version of YouTube

644
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:44,660
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so they didn't do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it intentionally I think there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

646
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,330
requests from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government that they</font>

647
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:53,750
block YouTube because of some cultural

648
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:57,650
reasons and to do that they went this

649
00:39:53,750 --> 00:40:00,290
way obviously lack of technical

650
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,390
knowledge on their pattern on the people

651
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:04,820
who did that and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that what</font>

652
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:09,830
happened was any prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was going</font>

653
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to YouTube ended up going to Pakistan</font>

654
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:15,170
telecom so obviously it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not good for</font>

655
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,049
Pakistan because it will overwhelm their

656
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:21,050
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was not good for in</font>

657
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:25,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube because nobody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was able to</font>

658
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:29,840
access YouTube service for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync for part</font>

659
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,759
of a day or for a full name<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

660
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,010
because Pakistan telecom advertised a

661
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,690
more specific version of YouTube prefix

662
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:41,510
in this case the advertiser / 24 of this

663
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:44,840
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube was advertising / 22</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

664
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:49,010
YouTube was being good from for the

665
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:52,100
internet and advertising only the prefix

666
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:54,350
of / 22 prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make Internet astable</font>

667
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,509
but Pakistan Telugu moralizing more

668
00:40:54,350 --> 00:41:01,540
specific so attracting the whole table

669
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:07,070
the whole traffic to them so question is

670
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:09,560
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent that so as a result</font>

671
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:14,090
of that and other incidents they started

672
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:16,009
working the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet domain</font>

673
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:20,740
routing working group with an ITF start

674
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:24,040
working on the origin is validation and

675
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you will see</font>

676
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,779
you see those and then if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

677
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:32,350
to the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group you will see a lot</font>

678
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:38,170
of drafts and rfcs treated with origin

679
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:41,020
validation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and rpki</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rpk refers to the</font>

680
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:45,400
resource public infrastructure let's use

681
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:48,450
to do origin validation and in summary

682
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:52,570
here is what it looks like so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

683
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:56,109
there is a remote distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpk</font>

684
00:41:52,570 --> 00:42:01,390
repository that stores the legitimate

685
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:04,810
owner of each prefix so the the origin

686
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:07,450
is of each prefix and through our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki</font>

687
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,600
cash a service provider can receive

688
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:14,799
therapy k cash information from the

689
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:19,120
cache servers it is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP protocol</font>

690
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:22,960
it's a different protocol but nowadays

691
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,310
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe at least couple of benders</font>

692
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,890
have already implemented it including

693
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:28,779
cisco and juniper but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure others</font>

694
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,150
have already started implementing it

695
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,630
implementing it so what you do is you

696
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:37,720
receive this from the registries and

697
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:40,420
then when you receive a route from a

698
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,149
service provider or appear you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

699
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:48,010
it against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database automatically</font>

700
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:51,550
and then it will classify the validity

701
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:55,210
validity status so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example</font>

702
00:42:51,550 --> 00:43:01,960
let's say let's say that registry

703
00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:04,150
database has what we call our or a ro is

704
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,690
on the right side and let's say you

705
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:10,810
receive from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your peer or from your ebgp</font>

706
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:13,690
peer those prefix on the left side so

707
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:17,290
the first one is in the history<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

708
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:19,990
matches that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s origin s number</font>

709
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:24,730
matches origin s number in the registry

710
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:33,189
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cache so it's considered to be</font>

711
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:36,460
valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in the second case there is</font>

712
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:38,940
no matching the in the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> case there</font>

713
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:45,520
is no matching prefix

714
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:48,789
10 01 / 24 oh that is a matching there's

715
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:56,349
a matching prefix which is 10 0 / 16

716
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:59,950
through 24 there's a matching prefix but

717
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:03,460
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the origin s is different the origin</font>

718
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:07,390
s in this case is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 and in some cases</font>

719
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:12,460
300 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the origin is received is 400 so</font>

720
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:16,480
in this case it is invalid<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that s is</font>

721
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:20,319
not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to originate that prefix but</font>

722
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,650
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a legitimate originator the</font>

723
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:26,109
third case is there is no much so this

724
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:32,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not in the registry so in this case</font>

725
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:35,799
is considered as unknown so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

726
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:39,788
happens is as this table is being built

727
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:41,170
some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rats may not be in the</font>

728
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:43,390
registry for some of the service

729
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:46,119
providers in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be in an</font>

730
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:48,220
unknown state from a preference

731
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:52,359
perspective obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you prefer valid</font>

732
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:56,828
and then unknown then invalid is the

733
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:59,078
last one and normally after that you can

734
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:01,839
apply policy so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a classification</font>

735
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:03,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then bgp is policy oriented then you</font>

736
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,839
can apply policy you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say if this</font>

737
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:12,299
invalid<font color="#CCCCCC"> block it drop it or prefer it</font>

738
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:14,380
less if it is unknown prefer it less

739
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:17,369
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can you can</font>

740
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:21,910
apply policies to influence the decision

741
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:25,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the but the job of the RP care system</font>

742
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">all origin validation system originated</font>

743
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:34,020
validation system is to validate the

744
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:37,029
origin so once the validations happened

745
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:41,609
the border router can notify other

746
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:45,039
routers through a new extended community

747
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:48,960
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state of the origin validation</font>

748
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:51,430
either invalid unknown or bodied and

749
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,740
then other routers can decide

750
00:45:51,430 --> 00:46:04,259
what to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that based on policy</font>

751
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:04,259
obviously question on<font color="#CCCCCC"> origin validation</font>

752
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:14,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is is how to</font>

753
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:24,309
implement on roll roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> out bgp in your</font>

754
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:26,650
network so you will need a CA number

755
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to deploy bgp you</font>

756
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:35,260
need autumn a system number if you are

757
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:37,030
multi ani to multiple eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece you</font>

758
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">will need a public ultimate system</font>

759
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:42,569
number if you are just peeling with one

760
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:49,440
isp you can use a private SI number

761
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:52,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">always knew you have to agree right if</font>

762
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,930
you need if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are going to peel with</font>

763
00:46:52,180 --> 00:47:00,040
multiple service providers then you need

764
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:04,240
to get your own assigned IP address from

765
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:08,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">the registry if you can get it right so</font>

766
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,939
it's it's running shorts right or you

767
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,160
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get if you are just peeling with one</font>

768
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:19,359
isp at multiple locations then you can

769
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:23,799
get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that is p so the assumption</font>

770
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:26,140
is there is no bgp running and there is

771
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:30,099
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea running so it's just a new</font>

772
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:31,779
network starting essentially so first

773
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:36,970
you have to decide what type of igp

774
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:42,369
protocol tron always pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SS both of</font>

775
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:45,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">them are linked state depending on it</font>

776
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:48,309
may end up being that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year maybe</font>

777
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:50,079
which protocol do I feel comfortable

778
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">with or which protocol guy and almost or</font>

779
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:59,319
my my team knows the most and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

780
00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:01,500
go with that one typically some people

781
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:04,810
prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a size some people prefer ospf so</font>

782
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:08,650
that's a different set of questions but

783
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:10,870
typically you will pick one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them then</font>

784
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,850
obviously you have to have new park IP

785
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,680
address is configured or this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

786
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:20,580
loopback IP address will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sliced</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 32</font>

787
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:28,600
and yeah it has to be injected<font color="#CCCCCC"> into igp</font>

788
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:31,660
and then you'll start it's used for bgp

789
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:34,000
as well as for route origination that's

790
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:44,350
the loopback<font color="#CCCCCC"> repairers it's also used</font>

791
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:46,990
for router ID for bgp if you have a

792
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:49,990
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has static routes you can</font>

793
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:52,750
deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP without impacting your</font>

794
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:56,680
network because in most kids static

795
00:48:52,750 --> 00:49:00,700
route has higher preference over<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP so</font>

796
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:02,859
by right by employing by adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP you</font>

797
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,770
are not really changing they're all

798
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,750
saying within your network but once you

799
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,910
deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP and make sure that the igp is</font>

800
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:12,730
working properly you can start removing

801
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:16,740
the static routes and then make that

802
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:16,740
your whole network is running<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

803
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:31,790
so it's very important that you your

804
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:34,720
links that database is lean so you don't

805
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:38,090
want to inject<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP into your I GP or or</font>

806
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">injects your customer networks into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

807
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:45,310
that will make your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp large and reduce</font>

808
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:47,600
your convergence and apply GP and

809
00:49:45,310 --> 00:50:00,710
convergence time of igp is very very

810
00:49:47,600 --> 00:50:02,720
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so if you have routes that</font>

811
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,280
do not go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> I GP for example if you</font>

812
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,180
have customers that are being aggregated

813
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:11,180
to this day sale or you have customers

814
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:13,279
that you have assigned IP address from

815
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:16,370
your address space then you can inject

816
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:24,820
those prefixes into I ibgp you don't

817
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:29,210
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put them in in I GP and also the</font>

818
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:31,970
interface address from your router to

819
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:34,070
your to your customer you don't need to

820
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:44,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">inject it into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP you can put them in</font>

821
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:49,520
in BGP the second stage is once you have

822
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:53,990
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP second stage is to to build</font>

823
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:57,100
your ibgp obviously if you have a small

824
00:50:53,990 --> 00:51:01,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">network you can do a full mesh ibgp if</font>

825
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:03,410
you anticipate large network or if you

826
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:06,860
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> large network then you have to do</font>

827
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:09,080
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> Confederation or rather flexor</font>

828
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,650
obviously rather reflectors baton if you

829
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:14,810
are starting fresh so you'll have to

830
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick a couple of routers azeroth</font>

831
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:18,580
reflectors or if these very large

832
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:21,470
networks enemy is split into multiple

833
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:23,600
zones and each one of them will have a

834
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:25,779
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wrath reflectors for identity</font>

835
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,779
purposes

836
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,819
so and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp must run on all the routers</font>

837
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:35,640
that are potentially used for transit

838
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:38,490
traffic and transit means transit from a

839
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,950
customer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the internet or</font>

840
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:44,279
transit from one customer to another or

841
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:50,819
transit from one service provider to

842
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:56,880
another service provider so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

843
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:59,220
phase is being the transit pass so here

844
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:04,890
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this particular example you can see</font>

845
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a and B are obviously transits but</font>

846
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:14,220
in case the link between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a and B goes</font>

847
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:17,190
down d is also transit but TEF are not

848
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really transit in this case so which</font>

849
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:23,970
means CEF do not we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to get the full</font>

850
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:29,640
Internet routing table of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> full table</font>

851
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:32,160
but a BD have to have the full internet

852
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,640
table if this network is going to become

853
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,640
a transit

854
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:45,680
so typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a transits if</font>

855
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:48,680
you are becoming a<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn if you are going</font>

856
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,519
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become a transit and in most cases</font>

857
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:55,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will have multiple layers</font>

858
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:58,459
here is an example a core distribution

859
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:02,029
and aggregation and typically the core

860
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:04,819
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the full the full internet</font>

861
00:53:02,029 --> 00:53:07,460
table the aggregation doesn't need to

862
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:10,720
have to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the full entire</font>

863
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:13,700
Beach p table but the distribution

864
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,750
depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scenario may or may not</font>

865
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:25,490
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in full internet table</font>

866
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:28,190
exchange again the key is if in any

867
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:31,129
circumstance any router may become a

868
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:40,460
transit then that autumn needs to have

869
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:44,109
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> full internet table so for</font>

870
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:47,509
aggregation layer ibgp is optional

871
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:50,269
because you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> run other protocol or</font>

872
00:53:47,509 --> 00:53:52,819
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP and then at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the distribution</font>

873
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:56,029
layer you can inject those us into ibgp

874
00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:58,299
or you can run you can extend your ibgp

875
00:53:56,029 --> 00:54:01,609
to aggregation layer and then inject

876
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:04,099
routes there but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

877
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:06,440
carry the full internet table it can

878
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:08,960
participate in ibgp and carry only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:16,240

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:19,700
to carry the full internet table and

881
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,649
actually most aggregation a lot of the

882
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,589
aggregation device may not even run<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

883
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:30,410

884
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:35,210
protocol the distribution layer usually

885
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:38,149
runs ibgp it may carry the food table or

886
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:40,970
may it may carry just partial depending

887
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:42,819
on again whether there is a possibility

888
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:45,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> become a transit or not if</font>

889
00:54:42,819 --> 00:54:47,990
it is going to become a transit then it

890
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:53,060
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to carry a full internet table if</font>

891
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:56,479
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no if we know that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is no</font>

892
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:58,670
that the distribution layer will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

893
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,410
transit then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no need to carry</font>

894
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:09,860
the full table partial will be

895
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:12,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">sufficient okay again it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

896
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">run ibgp in most cases it will run ibgp</font>

897
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:22,279
it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carry the full</font>

898
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:27,640
internet table and most case doesn't but

899
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:30,860
the core has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full bgp</font>

900
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:35,779
to drown ibgp should k the full internet

901
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:47,150
table the core includes the s border

902
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:53,120
routers as well so now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

903
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:55,630
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> on policy so do i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

904
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:59,410
full internet table everywhere or

905
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:05,240
partial somewhere and full somewhere or

906
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:07,129
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP somewhere and full ib</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gps in</font>

907
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:10,029
some places so depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

908
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:12,260
circumstance you decide that and

909
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:16,730
obviously you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to implement</font>

910
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:18,800
communities or scaling purpose again if

911
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,990
you think that your network is going to

912
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,070
grow or if it is large already then you

913
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:26,149
have to implement route reflectors

914
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:30,650
configuration templates are always

915
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:33,080
important and conclusion templates makes

916
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:38,320
it easier to scale your configuration

917
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:38,319
and also make your system stable

918
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:49,529
so what you do is to implement ibgp you

919
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:52,110
will implement I PHP mesh on select

920
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:54,210
routers let's say if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have fewer</font>

921
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:56,010
deflectors you'll have I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wish finish</font>

922
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the router collectors and then</font>

923
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:03,960
there will be clients those are out

924
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:06,150
reflectors another important thing is

925
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,680
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I bgp</font>

926
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:12,840
distance is greater than<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp distance</font>

927
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,520
distance is a preference in terms of

928
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:19,110
routing protocol which protocol to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

929
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:21,540
used when deciding that if a prefix is

930
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:24,060
received from two different protocols or

931
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:26,670
multiple protocols then the distance of

932
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protocol determines which one is the</font>

933
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:31,410
best the Lord sense is preferred tip

934
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,290
right typically for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a cisco</font>

935
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:38,040
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uses a distance of two</font>

936
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:42,270
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I GPS used depending on the</font>

937
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:49,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">IGP I think 40 s pen drives I size is</font>

938
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:49,940
about 110 115 but this nor<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ibgp</font>

939
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:58,740
step 2 you'll install customer prefixes

940
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:02,430
into bgp and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the network</font>

941
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:05,640
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still working and you can inject them</font>

942
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:08,129
using by pointing a static<font color="#CCCCCC"> no to a</font>

943
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:12,450
static route to the customer or a static

944
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:19,760
node<font color="#CCCCCC"> to at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the border router a floating</font>

945
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:22,759
static now that's this table and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

946
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,200
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already have static routes</font>

947
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,420
initially you have to gradually remove

948
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:32,660
them and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I GP takes care</font>

949
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:38,000
of that and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will configure</font>

950
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:42,109
ebgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> appear with your training providers</font>

951
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,110
peers or customers

952
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:52,859
so now installing customer prefixes I

953
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:56,040
got here is a summary we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

954
00:58:52,860 --> 00:59:00,120
discuss some of this if you have a

955
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:02,100
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned address space you can</font>

956
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:06,120
use a network statement to inject those

957
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:07,319
prefixes and you can use unique

958
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,020
community to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that those</font>

959
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:13,440
prefixes are not advertise it outside

960
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:15,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">your network if if those prefixes are</font>

961
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,220
advertised it from your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own address</font>

962
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:22,490
space you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to advertise the</font>

963
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:25,640
space because other service providers

964
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:28,939
the customer facing point point links

965
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:34,500
typically you can inject them into bgp

966
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:37,770
ibgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's and then use next hub self</font>

967
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:48,270
instead of using researching them into

968
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:50,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">IGP and if you have pools and local</font>

969
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">lance you can use again network segments</font>

970
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,580
to assign a prefix for those networks

971
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:05,160
again you will carefully remove the

972
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:06,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">static routes one out of time and this</font>

973
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,250
is assuming migration<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my static</font>

974
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,840
routes so if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything if</font>

975
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:11,190
you are starting from scratch then you

976
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,430
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have static lot you start from</font>

977
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:16,020
ibgp so in this particular case we

978
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:20,390
assume that initially there was static

979
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">route which is usually very unlikely</font>

980
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:31,910
but the key here is most of these steps

981
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:36,189
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have discussed are not flag days</font>

982
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:36,190
which means it doesn't really cause

983
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:42,110
disruption so you can do them step by

984
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:46,700
step step by step at<font color="#E5E5E5"> different times</font>

985
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:58,010
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance windows any</font>

986
01:00:46,700 --> 01:01:01,759
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here we will discuss</font>

987
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:03,470
some configuration tips and and

988
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,000
summarize some of the some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

989
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:12,319
discussions we discussed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect</font>

990
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:16,640
configuration so it's very important

991
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:19,730
that we use loopback IP addresses for I

992
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:22,160
beach be peering also use the loopback

993
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:30,350
IP address as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> X hub using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next hop</font>

994
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:32,450
self instead of instead of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

995
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:34,819
interface IP address directly connected

996
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:39,140
interface IP address as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> X hub which</font>

997
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:40,700
is a default behavior the dam is the

998
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,879
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the networks that connect</font>

999
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:49,370
your network to your peer either

1000
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:53,000
customer or another service provider you

1001
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:54,470
can inject them using using ibgp but if

1002
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,310
you do that then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use next</font>

1003
01:01:54,470 --> 01:02:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">half self so again summarizing the next</font>

peers without changing the next hub

1007
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:14,660
which is a directly connected interface

1008
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:16,879
or the peeling IP address but that's not

1009
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:21,950
recommended it's better<font color="#E5E5E5"> to override that</font>

1010
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:27,130
with next hop song and this is used by

beyond a certain number

1015
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:49,000
so it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do not exceed</font>

1016

a spaz links beyond a certain number

1017
01:02:51,339 --> 01:02:56,859
normally more than 20 is really too much

1018
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:02,930
there are tools you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beach be</font>

1020
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:09,069
length is on the internets unique links

1021
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:11,839
if you do pretend don't repent too much

1022
01:03:09,069 --> 01:03:14,660
because because those rafters may drop

1023
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:17,000
your advertisements those routers do

1024
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:20,540
know that do not support a spaz links

1025

beyond below being beyond certain number

1026
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:25,819
may drop your routes so it's important

1027
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:30,379
when you do prepend make sure that you

1028
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:34,279
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre-painting too much so as you</font>

1029
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:40,339
can see from last year report the

1030
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:43,790
average path length was 3.8 the maximum

<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> passed language is 13 but with the</font>

1032
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:50,240
pre-paint there were some a spaz lenses

1033
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:54,440
that as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as 34 and you considered</font>

1034
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:57,649
that that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad behavior because</font>

1035
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:59,690
the maximum length was 13 so if you

1036
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:01,819
exceed certain that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough so</font>

1037
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:05,660
the pre-paint should have just resulted

1038
01:04:01,819 --> 01:04:13,970
in 14 instead of 34 but because it was

1039
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:17,089
not done carefully it went up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 34 so</font>

1040
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:24,859
here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ridiculously long s</font>

1042
01:04:24,859 --> 01:04:34,490
is even unique it's not even any prepend

1043
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:39,109
then x1 is a prepend next one is does

1044

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> 23 s paths unique the eunuch s part</font>

1046
01:04:41,329 --> 01:04:48,880
prepended the 12 or 26 is prepended so

1047
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,879
many times

1048
01:04:51,470 --> 01:05:00,259
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit the maximum age bus</font>

1050
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:08,910
important limitation is generalized TTL

01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:32,480
I'll only accept bgp packets which are

1058
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:46,170
has to say the TTL to 255 so the

1059
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:49,020
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is if some if somebody</font>

1065
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:07,098
has gone below the TTL threshold that

1066
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:09,380
you set using the GT GTS same features

1067
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:12,329
most of the modern routers have

1068
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:15,930
implemented this in hardware so it's

1069
01:06:12,329 --> 01:06:19,260

dropped if you implement this feature so

1074
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:38,490
it's an important security feature so

1075
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:42,770
you can see that a legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic it</font>

from the loop r.i.p address you can also

support is only version supported linux

1116
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,480
are so there is no configuration for

1117
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,980

1118

set explicitly

1119
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:24,479
you can use a meaty<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 password I'm 85</font>

usually help you reduce the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall Lord</font>

1157
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:48,160
in terms of configuration so it helps

01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:49,980
you scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with that the session is</font>

concluded where we have plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

1160
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:55,290
so would be good if you have questions

changes you mean changes in BGP like a

01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:32,949
historical we<font color="#CCCCCC"> demo'd a product by packet</font>

design called route<font color="#CCCCCC"> Explorer is an</font>

1167
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:38,469
excellent product but is just way too

1168
01:12:34,419 --> 01:12:40,089
expensive and we've had trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding</font>

1169
01:12:38,469 --> 01:12:42,639
a solution that may work that's a little

1170
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,829
more affordable for higher ed yeah I'm

1171
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:46,869
not unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not aware of some</font>

1172
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:49,858
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those tools most of the others do not</font>

1173
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:51,969
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> that type of picture but</font>

1174
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:54,279
obviously you can have a tool that will

1175
01:12:51,969 --> 01:12:57,639
be lets say a client of ours reflector

1176
01:12:54,279 --> 01:13:00,429
and receive those updates but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

1177
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:05,739
aware of the tombs ask another question

01:13:00,429 --> 01:13:07,739
sure rpki<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm wondering we've got a</font>

1179
01:13:05,739 --> 01:13:12,759
scenario where we do appearing with LSU

1180
01:13:07,739 --> 01:13:16,749
there a s 2055<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're advertising us a</font>

1181
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:21,459
bunch of prefixes they own in v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> and v6</font>

1182
01:13:16,749 --> 01:13:25,959
and in a situation for their dorms we do

1183
01:13:21,459 --> 01:13:29,108
a private BG pas with them where we've

1184
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:31,329
allocated them our v4 space so it works

1185
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:35,079
fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're advertising us their</font>

1186
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:38,259
own v6 space and I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering with</font>

1187
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:40,959
rpki if it's doing that sanity check to

1188
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:43,089
see who owns<font color="#E5E5E5"> that prefix is that going</font>

1189
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:45,969
to break their v6 you know when we

1190
01:13:43,089 --> 01:13:48,929
advertise it out yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I that you have to</font>

1191
01:13:45,969 --> 01:13:51,429
disable<font color="#CCCCCC"> our PK checking with them</font>

1192
01:13:48,929 --> 01:13:55,769
otherwise they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to use their</font>

01:13:51,429 --> 01:14:04,109
assigned s number for our PK it work

Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> bush dragon labs um no they don't</font>

1195
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:16,260
you you have a separate trust anchor and

1196
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:21,909
have under that trust anchor a

1197
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:23,070
certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> or das and foot for the</font>

1201
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:37,349
them and then your<font color="#E5E5E5"> router's will</font>

1202
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:40,800
properly validate that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are</font>

1203
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:48,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">even further more baroque cases where</font>

01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:51,840
what you want is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> edit the structure</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole game of the rpki is the power</font>

1206
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:58,860
is with the relying party you who are

1207
01:14:55,470 --> 01:15:00,840
running the routers the operator and so

1208
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:03,330
there's even further something a draft

1209
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:06,180
that's out there and there's one and a

1210
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:09,750
half implementations called local trust

1211
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:14,240
anchor where you can actually remove

1212
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:21,350
things from the public tree and

1213
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:21,349
substitute your own um people doing

1214
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:29,820
complex private arrangements would use

1215
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:34,350
this um there are government's who like

1216

to UM edit the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more than</font>
