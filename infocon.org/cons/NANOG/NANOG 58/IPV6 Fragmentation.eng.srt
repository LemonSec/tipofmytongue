this is my crackpot idea of the day I'm

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about IP fragmentation and</font>

11
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:01,789
ipv6 fragmentation and why we should

deprecated it first a little background

13
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:08,670
there's the status quo right now when an

14
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,670
ipv6 source node has a packet to send

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is larger than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the PMT you it can</font>

reassemble the fragments in v6 only

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,290
hosts can fragment a packet that's

discouraged in fact it discouraged in

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:38,610
RFC 2460 the reason why is reassembly is

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,090
concerns and there were other bigger

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,460
issues that we like not to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,640
public let's talk about the security

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,169
current concerns first the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first is dos</font>

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,299
attacks and there are basically two

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,570
flavors of dos attacks that we've seen

32
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,000
over the years one is where the attacker

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:04,380
sends fragmented packets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim</font>

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he engineers this flow of fragmented</font>

35
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,990
packets to consume maximum resources on

36
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> victim's platform</font>

37
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,330
another flavor of attack the attacker

38
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,010
spoofs packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> two big messages to the</font>

41

partner think that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTB to the victim</font>

is small and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim sends the</font>

legitimate communication pack partner

44
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,299
starts fragmenting packets that don't

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,359
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be fragmented that's one</font>

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,730
kind of security concern another

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,170
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern that Fernando Gant has</font>

48
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,720
just pointed out is evasion attacks

49
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:48,089
let's assume for a moment that you have

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,270
a stateless firewall and it filters

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,260
based on oh say IP source address and

52
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:58,640
TCP port well an attacker wants to evade

53
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:02,100
that firewall so what he does is

54
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,809
engineers his packets so that the IP

55
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,140
header<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the first fragment and the</font>

56
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,490
TCP header is in the second fragment

57
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:14,579
every fragment evades the firewall

58
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:18,560
filter so yet a new security concern and

59
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,990
now the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really bothers us</font>

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,900
implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight implementations</font>

61
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,690
occasionally deal badly with some kinds

62
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,810
of fragmenting issues fragment overlap

63
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,380
fragment override over on too many

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,330
packets being fragmented simultaneously

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,269
well yeah these are all bugs and good

66
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,150
implementations deal with these except

67
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:47,150
when they don't what should concern us

68
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:50,130
all is randomly exercised code in the OS

69
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,690
so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all concerns about</font>

70
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:59,370
fragmentation well we have some

71
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:03,210
alternatives to ipv6 fragmentation one

72
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:06,750
bad alternative is just never send a

73
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:09,209
packet bigger than 1280 bytes this works

74
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,680
in the vast majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact I</font>

75
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,930
can only think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one case where it</font>

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't work and that's where there's</font>

77
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,840
some middle box translating to ipv4 in

78
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,488
that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box might send back</font>

79
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,060
packet to big message

80
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,830
with an MTU of less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than twelve eighty</font>

81
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,539
yeah this works in most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a</font>

82
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:33,389
hammer that's way too big we don't want

83
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:36,440
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a better alternative and this</font>

84
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:40,050
is the one that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on is</font>

85
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,860
have upper layer protocols either

86
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,800
execute path MTU discovery procedures or

87
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:52,259
packetization layer MTU discovery

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:55,340
procedures now this just moves the

89
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:59,400
problem of fragmentation and reassembly

90
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:01,469
up from the IP layer to a higher layer

91
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:08,638
there's no such thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch</font>

92
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:12,180
here somebody has to track the PMT you

93
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,370
to the destination we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just moved the</font>

94
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,710
responsibility all the data structures

95
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,759
all the processing just moved up from

96
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:24,979
the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer to a higher layer many TCP</font>

97
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,979
implementations do this already

98
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:34,770
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to RFC 5405 UDP based</font>

99
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,530
applications shouldn't send datagrams

100
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,909
that are so large that they cause IP

101
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,948
fragmentation they should either look at

102
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:47,810
the MTU information that the IP layer

103
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintains implement p MTU discovery</font>

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:56,520
themselves or send only<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not know</font>

105
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,630
not to exceed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PMT you but many event</font>

106
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:06,690
well behaved applications today do not

107
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:09,300
send fragment than to ipv6 packets now

108
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:13,259
what's the benefit of doing this well

109
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,199
again we move the responsibility of

110
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,630
fragmentation and reassembly from the IP

111
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,690
layer to an upper layer we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

115
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,569
localizes the risk if something goes bad

116
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:37,469
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> affects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fewer applications on the box</font>

117
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:42,269
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allows for layer specific</font>

118

00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:48,149
mechanisms that it can use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very</font>

120
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective for TCP transport if an</font>

121
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,409
application knows perfectly well that it

122
00:06:50,039 --> 00:07:00,509
sends only short datagrams it knows it

123
00:06:52,409 --> 00:07:03,019
can avoid the whole problem so let's

124
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:07,739
discuss operational reality for a while

125
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:11,669
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet today ipv6 fragmentation</font>

126
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:13,619
is extremely rare most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular TCP</font>

127
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:17,579
implementations already do p MTU

128
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:21,689
discovery or PL MTU discovery so TCP

129

applications rarely<font color="#E5E5E5"> emit a fragment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

131
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,179
abide by the recommendations of 5405

132
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:35,939
already they either send short packets

133
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:38,669
or they do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discover the MT</font>

134
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:40,919
of the path MTU there are a few

135
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:44,008
important exceptions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance we</font>

139
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:58,309
an exception there were other exceptions

140

out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting to be discovered and</font>

141
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:04,229
here's the bitter truth a while ago

142
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,649
somebody talked about the Atlas ripe

143
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:12,179
ripe Atlas Project someone did some

144
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:16,099
study at NL labs and using those ripe

145
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:19,979
Atlas probes looked at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many paths</font>

146
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:24,569
that would pass ipv6 datagrams would

147
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:29,729
also pass ipv6 fragments well what they

148
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:33,779
found of observed paths<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12% that would</font>

149
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:37,500
pass ipv4 traffic would not pass ipv4

150
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:40,198
fragments so for ipv4 twelve percent of

151
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,659
paths will not let fragmented traffic

152
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:43,630
through we have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea why they're</font>

153
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,040
dropping<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fragma</font>

154
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,170
or where they're being dropped although

155
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,439
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect it's you know at the at the</font>

156
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">network edge at the enterprise for ipv6</font>

157
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,650
the number was much more shocking forty

158
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:03,760
percent of paths would not pass ipv6

159
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:07,240
fragments so my friends if you're

160
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,400
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 fragments today I wouldn't</font>

161
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,270
bet<font color="#CCCCCC"> your house that they're getting all</font>

162
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,220
the way from end to end thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

163
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,660
folks who did this study there's a

164
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,660
reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their paper at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

165
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">so where does this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave us with a</font>

166
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">recommendation in a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days you'll see</font>

167
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,800
a draft posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to six men it will</font>

168
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,970
recommend the deprecation of the ipv6

169
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,740
header now what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

170
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,230
applications you know please don't write

171
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,830
any new applications that fragment ipv6

172
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,270
packets existing applications will

173
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,240
continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

174
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:50,890
deprecation they will work as well or as

175
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,740
poorly as they do today the draft will

176
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,560
also state that operators may discard

177
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,840
packets containing the ipv6 fragment

178
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,890
header and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't shock</font>

179
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,650
everybody because operators already do

180
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:08,980
discard packets containing the ipv6

181
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,900
fragment header<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm coming here today so</font>

182
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,410
that when the conversation comes up on

183
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> six-man list hopefully all you folks</font>

184
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:20,500
will chime in and either support the

185
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">position or burn me at the stake thank</font>

you very much

187
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,500
but hopefully no burning at the stake

188
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we do have a few moments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

189
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,150
questions just of note there's no
