beignets are really good out there all

14

right we'll we'll take another stab at

15
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,320
that after a talk or two here maybe

16
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,280
we'll get some of our potential winners

17
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,949
in the room coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up first we have</font>

Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grundmann with cablelabs he's got</font>

19
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,049
to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of home</font>

20
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,049
networking Chris

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,860
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah so I'm gonna talk</font>

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of home networking and</font>

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,000
looking at kind of an incremental

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,270
approach of how to get from<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to that</font>

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,740
future and looking at this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of broke</font>

26
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,119
it into four steps and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,740
focus really on the second step because

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,840
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're really kind of into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,429
first step already so the second step

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,810
being the most important ones it's the

31
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,190
next one we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take so I'm gonna</font>

32
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,560
focus there and then look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what what</font>

33
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,570
comes beyond that as well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,010
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with looking at why a lot of</font>

35
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,589
people have overlooked home networks in

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past a couple of meetings ago I laid</font>

37
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,709
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem statement for home</font>

38
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,730
networks and why they were becoming more

39
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,820
advanced why they were becoming more

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,840
complex and why more serious network

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,570
engineers probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay attention</font>

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,800
to them and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we've ignored so</font>

43
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,380
far as you know today you have one

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,270
router one homeland one isp and it's

45
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">really you know really really simple and</font>

46
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,870
really there's nothing going on there

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,299
that's interesting at all maybe a user

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,660
adds another router for some extra

49
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,160
switch ports or Wi-Fi range extension

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,600
and that pretty much just works today

51
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,280
without before you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stack the</font>

52
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,140
Nats which probably break service

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,459
discovery and some other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

54
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,339
these you know individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT Poole's</font>

55
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,959
but you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic web and email and</font>

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">in basic stuff it just kind of works and</font>

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's all okay but we see this changing</font>

58
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,920
over the next few years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then already</font>

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,359
starting to change one of the first

60
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,429
things is people are starting to realize

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information on the</font>

62
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,880
computers as they may not want visitors

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,790
to their house especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know their</font>

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,260
kids friends or you know in-laws maybe

65
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,820
don't want to see their tax returns or

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,070
photos they may have on storage

67
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,739
somewhere and so setting up a guest SSID

68
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,239
so that you can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet access</font>

69
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,410
to visitors without providing them

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,989
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your homeland and all your</font>

71
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,700
home pcs and then on top of that there's

72
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,920
other reasons for service providers to

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,018
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> services based on home routers</font>

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,010
to folks maybe not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home at</font>

75
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,090
all right femtocell and wireless their

76
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,828
community wireless services and things

77
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,360
like that and then you go down the list

78
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,500
and things like smart grid<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,150
to come out which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is adding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to be</font>

80
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,430
services to your home it may be are not

81
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,930
necessarily under your control the whole

82
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,120
range of security monitoring and

83
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,410
automation the whole SMA world is kind

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,810
of blowing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and moving more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

85
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,030
into IP and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more IP devices</font>

86
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,260
there and more reasons for extra routers

87
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,100
and extra complications in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home</font>

88
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,329
network

89
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,010
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing and then the</font>

90
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,150
big one is of course IP content sharing

91
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,709
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether you're streaming IP video</font>

92
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,170
from outside of the home or within the

93
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,610
home device to device we've seen more

94
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,519
and more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this more and more contents</font>

95
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,560
on IP telecommuting adds a bunch of

96
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,820
additional requirements some

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,340
corporations want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to have a separate</font>

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,380
network for your work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home your home</font>

99
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,300
office<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then there's you know</font>

100
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,350
specific VPN requirements the security

101
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,420
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> confidential</font>

102
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,120
requirements there and then just just

103
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very basic you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know explosion of IP</font>

104
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,870
enabled devices so a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

105
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,940
carry a phone and a tablet and a laptop

106
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,040
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have a PC at home and then you</font>

107
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,120
know you've got spouses and kids and

108
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,010
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and family</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all have these</font>

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,110
devices as well in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

110
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,030
sensor networks and again the security

111
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,680
monitoring automation devices and a

112
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,960
whole range<font color="#CCCCCC"> of IP enabled devices in the</font>

113
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,550
home and then some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those aren't</font>

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,989
running Ethernet they're not running

115
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet so they'll be on you know</font>

116
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">zigbee your z-wave or some other link</font>

117
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,299
layer technology that needs a gateway<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

118
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,510
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to access the home network and</font>

119
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,680
so what we see happening is you know the

120
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,450
simple home network becomes a lot less

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,950
simple when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you add a home entertainment</font>

122
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,810
gateway maybe to connect your wireless

123
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,719
speakers and your receiver and all of

124
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,460
those devices and then perhaps an IP

125
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,460
sensor gateway that then connects out to

126
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,260
you know buy your home monitoring

127
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps that is you</font>

128
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">know an automation gateway that connects</font>

129
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,159
into you know a zigbee or again it could

130
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,710
be z-wave or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth or anything else</font>

131
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,210
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then of course the expresses ideas</font>

132
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,859
like I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you see as</font>

133
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,450
you end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly complex on</font>

134
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">network multiple routers in the home and</font>

135
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,479
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases I think users aren't even</font>

136
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,490
going to realize they're adding routers

137
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,320
to the house<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so if a particular</font>

138
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,850
vendor decides that they're building out

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,180
you know the smart kitchen of the future

140
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,650
and in their design your refrigerator is

141
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,390
the gateway to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your other</font>

142
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,679
appliances then you may be buying a

143
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,719
refrigerator and also installing the

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,580
router in your home and same thing with

145
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,600
other things as well where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

146
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessary in in on purpose adding extra</font>

147
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,120
router to their home but probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

148
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,550
be anyway so and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

149
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,530
right home users<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not all network</font>

150
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,750
engineers and not all network operators

151
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,099
and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be so it you have</font>

152
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,680
to have these additional routers

153
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,330
additional complexity without any

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,500
configuration right<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you want</font>

155
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">managed network which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

156
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,830
separate issue

157
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,409
and why am I even talking about this

158
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">right why is this important well there's</font>

159
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's two big reasons for home</font>

160
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,659
networks to be important to particularly

161
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,490
residential broadband providers right

162
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,410
and that is that failure in the home

163
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,420
network will cause service calls whether

164
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,780
or not it's your fault right so if the

165
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,040
user can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something based on an</font>

166
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,880
internet connection but even if it's a

167
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,160
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their home network they're</font>

168
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,300
still going to call you and you probably

169
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,590
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to troubleshoot it so you want it</font>

170
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just work so they don't have to do</font>

171
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,330
that call and then having this common

172
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,590
platform for IP services that allows you

173
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,099
to sell additional services into the

174
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,419
home so understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home networks</font>

175
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,560
are becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complex and that they</font>

176
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">are probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more important to you than</font>

177
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,310
you may have realized we start with

178
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,410
phase 1 of this incremental approach

179
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,450
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just basically adding a cutie</font>

180
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,430
six right so ipv6 is being deployed

181
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,380
today in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that deployment</font>

182
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,530
ends at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer's doorstep because</font>

183
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,490
at home router there's smart TV many of

184
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,530
the things inside the house don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I</font>

193

194
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,670
ipv6 to enable subtended routers so that

195
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,530
second router there doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any way</font>

196
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,640
to get addresses or a prefix or anything

197
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the first router so you have an</font>

199
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
second router that was added for you

200
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,530
know maybe Wi-Fi extension into the

201
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,640
garage so so there's some some big

202
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,489
issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was phase one it's that</font>

203
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,990
moves into phase 2 hip net is the

204
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of worked up</font>

205
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">with in cable abs and among our members</font>

206
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,940
and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors as well it's just</font>

207
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,320
an acronym for<font color="#E5E5E5"> home IP networking and</font>

208
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,690
what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically looks at a</font>

209
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,440
self configuring home router

210
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:54,440
architecture so it adds flexibility

211
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,230
scalability being you know zero

212
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,310
configuration in most cases and just

213
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,260
adaptable to whatever the home

214
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,640
environment is and using no new

215
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:06,740
protocols so to start with when we

216
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">started this design process we look at</font>

217
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,020
some common principles right the first

218
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,130
thing was what I already talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

219
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,090
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the home networks are going to</font>

220
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,919
become<font color="#CCCCCC"> more complex but home users</font>

221
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,940
are not so it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be self</font>

222
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,900
configuring it needs to go to figure

223
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,240
this out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> its own and he's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

224
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,349
just work right and then the second

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens when we start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

226
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,900
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a lot people say well just</font>

227
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,099
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all a big layer to domain and</font>

228
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,010
have everything connect to one big box

229
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,960
and the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle is invoking a</font>

230
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,190
god box leads to religious wars rights

231
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,330
if you have disparate vendors and

232
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,490
disparate technologies and different

233
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,250
approaches all trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect through</font>

234
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,430
one home gateway the<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely outcome is</font>

235
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,900
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be good we also believe the</font>

236
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,338
new protocols bring new problems so

237
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,588
solving this with the protocols that are

238
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:47,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">already running on home routers is the</font>

239
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,540
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible solution and we want to</font>

240
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,920
base it on ipv6 that musics gives us

241
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,599
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> very cool tools for going to the</font>

242
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,770
future but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to support have to</font>

243
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,630
be for for a very very long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

244
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,069
obviously and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then once we're basing</font>

245
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,130
this on ipv6 we know that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have enough</font>

246
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,480
addresses so you know specific address

247
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,480
conservation is not necessarily a goal

248
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,750
so hip net basically takes care of all

249
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,450
of this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> self</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizing using what</font>

250
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,920
we're calling directionless routers it

251
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,330
provides addressing for all the devices

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,349
in the home using recursive prefix

253
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,850
delegation so does prefix delegation

254
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,670
over and over again down through the

255
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,720
layers on hierarchical routing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> breed</font>

256
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,969
dead simple and doesn't require any

257
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,440
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> between routers and the</font>

258
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,550
bonus is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this supports not only</font>

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,380
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be 6 but also have it before</font>

260
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:33,569
without any additional work we did

261
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,300
demonstrate a working prototype at<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf</font>

262
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">86 so so they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually works as well</font>

263
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,349
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice starting with the</font>

264
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,390
directionless home routers idea today

265
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,560
routers have where<font color="#CCCCCC"> our basically home</font>

266
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,569
routers are directional right they have

267
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,939
a dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> way in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> port and dedicated</font>

268
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,260
land ports and you have to plug it in

269
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,910
correctly right and when you're talking

270
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know your grandfather or your</font>

271
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,089
cousin or somebody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has no idea what</font>

272
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,350
networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that's actually harder</font>

273
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,940
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds especially when you have</font>

274
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,650
multiple routers and cables running

275
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,779
around all over the place or through

276
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,800
walls<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things it's more and more</font>

277
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely these things I'm not going to get</font>

278
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,240
plugged in right so I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> make all</font>

279
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,040
ports equal and use an algorithm in the

280
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,270
router so that it can determine which

281
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,680
ones are<font color="#E5E5E5"> swam toward which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

282
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">land ports we're calling that up</font>

283
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,000
detection so in this case we install the

284
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,290
second router in the middle there it

285
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,150
basically goes through as normal process

286
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,219
of sending out router solicitations on

287
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,270
all of its interfaces and then any

288
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,070
interface that it receives<font color="#E5E5E5"> a router</font>

289
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,670
advertisement on becomes a candidate up

290
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,290
in

291
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,089
Faison up means towards the internet and

292
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,060
so any candidate interface is then going

293
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP it's going to ask for ID</font>

294
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,890
you know address and its prefix and then

295
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,780
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the response it's going to</font>

296
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,550
determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know</font>

297
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,890
determine which interface it wants to

298
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,689
use as its internet-facing interface in

299
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,160
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it gets it's going to take the</font>

300
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">first offer and choose that as a</font>

301
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,400
tiebreaker and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick that as its up route</font>

302
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,140
so what there is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an algorithm</font>

303
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,990
here to go through you're gonna prefer

304
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,460
valid global prefixes right and then

305
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,840
integer internal prefixes are going to

306
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,700
preferred over external prefixes and

307
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,980
that's for<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming backup which I</font>

308
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,480
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit later on and</font>

309
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,470
then largest prefix because again if

310
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,810
you're doing recursive prefix delegation

311
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,160
the closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the service writer you are</font>

312
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,689
the bigger prefix you're going to have

313
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,819
to hand out to a subtended router and

314
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,950
then after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes into basically</font>

315
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,510
tiebreakers which is the link type and

316
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,130
bandwidth the first response<font color="#CCCCCC"> louis</font>

317
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,000
numerical prefix just to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

318
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,980
it's deterministic but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of arbitrary</font>

319
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,690
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more complicated</font>

320
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,520
example with a few routers so route or

321
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">two there gets added in on the left hand</font>

322
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">side skipping over the neighbor</font>

323
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,430
discovery park he sees three routers so

324
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,740
he sends out his dhcp request and gets

325
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,790
back responses from all of them are one

326
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,170
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is connected to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

327
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,510
provider in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case let's say he got a</font>

328
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,890
/ 56 from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a service provider and he's</font>

329
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,960
breaking her down on nibble boundaries

330
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,150
so he offers a / 60 the other two

331
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,100
routers got a / 60 from our wand so they

332
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,439
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only offer a / 64 if they continue</font>

333
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,360
that nibble boundary breakdown so based

334
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,890
on that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two without knowing anything</font>

335
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,810
about the topology or where it's at just

336
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,730
based on those<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp offers it realizes</font>

337
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,800
that are one is the proper route to the

338
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet pics that is up and now that</font>

339
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,819
becomes<font color="#CCCCCC"> its the HTTP client interface</font>

340
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,740
the other interfaces become<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP servers</font>

341
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,320
and it just works as a regular home

342
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,020
router with open down ports land and

343
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,400
WHAM it also works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for rearranging the</font>

344
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,140
network so if we move our for up to the

345
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,209
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> again you go through the same</font>

346
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,699
process of sending out router

347
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,350
solicitations are one because he thinks

348
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,520
that's his internet interfacing

349
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,650
interface isn't going to respond

350
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,270
actually in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case so our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for then</font>

351
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,740
realizes there's the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> or one</font>

352
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,210
keeps the same up interface but is now

353
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,710
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know bumped down in the hierarchy</font>

354
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,120
he's going to pull new<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp and</font>

355
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,630
everything just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of keeps going</font>

356
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,630
keeps working

357
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,230
so what we've basically done here has

358
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken physically arbitrary topology</font>

359
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,810
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just kind of plug</font>

360
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,360
plug the routers together willy-nilly

361
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,550
and based on this up detection you've

362
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,410
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logical hierarchy and the nice</font>

363
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing about a logical hierarchy is then</font>

364
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,650
you can do this recursive prefix

365
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,140
delegation so the first router so you

366
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,880
get to / 56 from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a service provider he</font>

367
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,890
takes that breaks it up into chunks

368
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,150
hands chunks down so say you give /

369
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,189
sixties dem of the routers below him

370
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,449
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then break that up I kind out /</font>

371
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">mystic force the battery below them it</font>

372
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,110
just recurse is down through what

373
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,550
becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting here then is</font>

374
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,500
you have to decide how to break that

375
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,689
prefix up so i'm using nibble boundaries

376
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,060
as an example here which may work in

377
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,160
some scenarios but not in all and what I

378
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the best way to look at how to do</font>

379
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,089
the prefix delegation how to break up

380
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,230
the prefixes is based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're</font>

381
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,140
calling width and depth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home</font>

382
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,920
network don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that real quick</font>

383
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,360
the width of the home network is

384
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,120
basically how many routers are directly

385
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,110
attached to you so that's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> wit so in</font>

386
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,060
this case if there's three routers

387
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,310
connected to our one that's a width of 3

388
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,140
and if you were to add you know two more

389
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,780
routers you'd have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a width of five and</font>

390
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,810
then conversely the depth is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

391
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,790
routers are connected in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cereal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blowing</font>

392
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,339
so how many layers of routers below you

393
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,400
have so in this case you'd have a depth

394
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> four so based on width and depth you</font>

395
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,670
kind of get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea for how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many routers</font>

396
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:51,750
you have to serve and how many routers

397
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,670
they have to serve and so in order to

398
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,990
optimize the prefix delegation you have

399
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,520
to break<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the prefix based on those</font>

400
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,660
things so we fit the previous delegation

401
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the width and depth of the network</font>

402
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,360
and again we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to add any new</font>

403
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,920
protocols or any new communication

404
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,360
between routers so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually just use</font>

405
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,459
things that we know we're using physical

406
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,680
port count as a proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for wit so if you</font>

407
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,210
have for physical ports it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlikely</font>

408
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,069
that you can connect more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

409
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,570
routers directly right now you it's

410
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible you can add a switch and you</font>

411
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,200
can use Wi-Fi you can do other things

412
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,880
but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general case right the kind</font>

413
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of eighty percent rule most the time</font>

414
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,100
you're not going to go to connect more

415
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,229
than four routers directly to have

416
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,120
routed with four ports so you can use

417
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and then base your your bit</font>

418
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
boundaries on the width of the network

419
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,980
and optimize for the most amount of

420
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,870
depth so you basically say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font>

421
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,510
have you know with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four then I'm</font>

422
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to break up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefix into as big</font>

423
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,990
of chunks as possible to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

424
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,190
serve for routers with prefixes and then

425
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,630
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have the biggest prefix as</font>

426
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,180
possible so that it can

427
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearse through his deep of a depth as as</font>

428
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:50,579
we can at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this right when</font>

429
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,740
you've done this up detection created a

430
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,510
logical hierarchy and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> recruits the</font>

431
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,440
prefix delegation down through you end

432
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,689
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a really dead simple</font>

433
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,670
hierarchical<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table so you have a</font>

434
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,650
default router you you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes up</font>

435
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,329
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> out your you're when facing your</font>

436
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,040
internet facing interface and then the

437
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,750
down routes are all really easy because

438
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">you handed prefixes out to these address</font>

439
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,290
so these routers below you so you've

440
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,910
given them a lan interface IP address

441
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,349
and you've given them a prefix so if you

442
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,640
route that prefix to that IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

443
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,530
you're done the next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens</font>

444
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,600
it's really cool with this at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least in</font>

445
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,310
my opinion is what we're calling using

446
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,100
the link ID to do multiple address

447
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,859
family support so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at a global</font>

448
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,470
ipv6 address you've got 128 bits the

449
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,300
leftmost 48 bits are we don't think a

450
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,950
home's going to get more than 48 / 48

451
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so the leftmost 48 bits can kind</font>

452
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,600
of be ignored their the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP designator</font>

453
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,160
and the rightmost 64 bits obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

454
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,650
interface identifier<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that's the</font>

455
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,270
actual IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gets put on the port so</font>

456
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,829
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting that is these 16 bits</font>

457
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,439
in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're calling the</font>

458
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,520
link ID and the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

459
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,090
interesting is because then if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

460
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,370
a new 48 bits on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front so say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ula</font>

461
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,280
prefix for example and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use those</font>

462
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,720
same 16 bits you've now got a prefix

463
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that other routers in the home will know</font>

464
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,480
that you're using because you're using

465
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same 16 bits that were assigned to</font>

466
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,540
you by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router above you who's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

467
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,949
one routing to you and you know have a /

468
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,420
64 that you can use in euless<font color="#CCCCCC"> pace</font>

469
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,610
without any additional prefix delegation

470
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,189
without any routing protocol without any

471
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,840
other communication between the routers

472
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,370
and the other cool thing is 16 bits

473
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,030
works out really well if you put it

474
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:23,010
behind 10 dot right if you use 10 / 8

475
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:26,189
and you move those 16 bits down now I've

476
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,630
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an I 54 / 24 as well so I only have</font>

477
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,340
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT once in the house because I've</font>

478
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,689
got the 10 dot space being actually

479
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,110
intelligently routed through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

480
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:36,290
and a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet facing</font>

router

482
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,809
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this solution also has some</font>

483
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,860
basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming support we've kind of</font>

484
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,719
looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing in three ways</font>

485
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,850
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the special purpose IP</font>

486
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,529
connection so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a internet</font>

487
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,290
connection that's for data and then you

488
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,749
also have an IP screaming connection or

489
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:57,420
you have a video provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's doing</font>

490
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:58,620
IP directly or something like that in

491
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">those cases we think that's probably to</font>

492
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,139
be somewhat of a managed service well

493
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">gimme something that's installed and</font>

494
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,640
configured for you so it's kind of out

495
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,959
of scope what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at so you're</font>

496
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,390
left with the backup connection we have

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,189
two isps and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's active one standby</font>

498
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,689
and then true<font color="#E5E5E5"> multihoming we're doing</font>

499
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,480
active active like load balancing across

500
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:16,559
two links both of these can work with

501
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,630
this model and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an auto</font>

502
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,309
configuration method we focused on the

503
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,510
backup connection because we think

504
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:24,089
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most common case at least</font>

505
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">today we don't see a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know again looking outside of this room</font>

507
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,168
outside of the folks in the ITF to the

regular you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Joe Sixpack user there</font>

510
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,600
as probably just for backup is probably

511
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,460
don't care about actually doing load

512
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,270
balancing across the two and the back of

513
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,940
connection that's what we did the

514
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,770
internal versus external in the

515
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm for determining which ways up</font>

516
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,158
what that basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> does is if there's</font>

517
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">already an active internet connection in</font>

518
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:50,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">the home and a second router connects</font>

519
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and realizes that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L it also has an</font>

520
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,130
internet connection it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

521
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,820
the internet connection that was there

522
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,380
but beforehand and then if that one were

523
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,700
to fail then it'll take over and the

524
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:06,149
tree will rebuild and you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

525
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:07,409
backup connection so that's kind of the

526
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:09,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">hip that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solution which is which is the</font>

527
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:12,539
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> step and then phase three looks</font>

528
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,860
at the the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> step which is more</font>

529
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,740
efficient utilization of those links in

530
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,270
the home so you had this physical

531
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,710
connections you know kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of willy nilly</font>

532
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,730
this arbitrary topology well maybe it's

533
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,809
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so willy-nilly maybe you actually</font>

534
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,970
connected those together because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

535
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,549
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some closer links within</font>

536
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,470
the home so the hip net solution just

537
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing recursive prefix delegation and</font>

538
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,460
then the hierarchical routing you end up

539
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,320
losing some of those links right which

540
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,640
in most homes is probably ok but if you

541
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,168
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more efficient actually use</font>

542
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,140
the shortest paths you could add a

543
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:42,000
routing protocol potentially in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home</font>

rip or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> stripped-down version of ospf</font>

545
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,419
or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and actually be able to use all</font>

546
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,669
of your links and have a logical mesh

547
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,820
that's built on this hierarchical prefix

548
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,820
delegation

549
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,340
study that you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step beyond</font>

550
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,020
and then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go even further than</font>

551
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,669
that and there's work going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

552
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">IETF home networking group that looks at</font>

553
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,100
what i would consider some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

554
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,120
further out stuff some of these things

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are a little bit further out that</font>

556
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,159
can be some neat stuff so there's some

557
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,679
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP enhancements right so</font>

558
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,920
one of them is to use ospf to actually

559
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,020
assign the prefixes so if you obviously

560
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,760
the hierarchical model you end up

561
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,770
wasting a lot of addresses right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

562
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,210
you're building this big hierarchical

563
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,200
pyramid and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe chunks of it</font>

564
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,940
missing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there may not be routers</font>

565
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,400
and every one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those slots so you're</font>

566
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,200
using some addresses kind of for white

567
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,460
space that aren't actually being used

568
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,260
with this the ospf to assign prefixes

569
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,150
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically introduced two new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LSAs</font>

570

that it can advertise the aggregate

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,960
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know at the customer edge will</font>

576
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,190
actually able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this LSA to hand 64</font>

577
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,600
is directly two routers who need them

578
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,700
and you can use your addresses a lot

579
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,889
more efficiently whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that's</font>

580
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,630
something that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not one</font>

581
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,690
hundred percent convinced but it is

582
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,070
definitely an efficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition and</font>

583
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,809
there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft within the home</font>

584
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,879
networking group that's using<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

585
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:05,190
adjacencies to defined the borders of

586
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,679
the network and it basically uses again

587
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,330
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a routing protocol burning</font>

588
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,620
in the home you look for neighbors and

589
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,970
if you have a neighbor you realize

590
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,770
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal to your home and if you</font>

591
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,240
have a connection without a neighbor

592
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,980
that's probably external to the home

593
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,179
it's then you can find these edges of

594
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,260
the network which may not be just your

595
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,760
internet connection and maybe other

596
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,860
boundaries maybe I'll just you know

597
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,879
smart grids type stuff or maybe there's

598
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,668
another part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network that's not</font>

599
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,809
participating I could have held

600
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:30,740
community example we may have a home

601
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,740
office something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

602
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,479
and then beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> step the</font>

603
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,400
next thing within this kind of phase for

604
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,590
further out stuff is looking at better

605
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again there's a</font>

606
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,340
few drafts in the home networking group

607
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,280
a one is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seder work which is source</font>

608
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,530
address dependent routing which

609
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,580
basically looks at the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> address so</font>

610
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,020
if you have well if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're multihomed</font>

611
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,230
write a lot most residential service

612
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,490
writers today won't accept packets with

613
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,930
source addresses that they didn't give

614
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,760
you rights if you have two connections

615
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,890
and you have two prefixes from two

616
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,570
different providers and you send packets

617
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,430
out provider a their source from

618
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,720
provider brief space more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than likely</font>

619
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,590
they're going to be dropped and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

620
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropped if I'm not gonna</font>

621
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,970
make it back so this actually has the

622
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,440
routers look at the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> address to</font>

623
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,730
determine which router to send them out

624
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">of which internet connection to you so</font>

625
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,160
that that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you don't run</font>

626
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">into those reverse path forwarding</font>

627
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,520
problems there's another draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> or below</font>

628
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that thats basically uses a middle box</font>

629
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,060
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing service provider to</font>

630
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,399
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing so you basically</font>

631
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,629
have your internet gateways and then a

632
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,280
middle box behind them in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

633
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,220
that's the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

634
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,180
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which router to send it out</font>

635
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,860
of which internet connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it</font>

636
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,960
out of and then on the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

637
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,580
your multihomed ISPs you've got a

638
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing service provider that's</font>

639
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,919
choosing which service writer is

640
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:49,220
something that gets back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you kind</font>

641
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,090
of got middleboxes on both ends may or

642
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,010
may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you wanna look at</font>

643
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:56,090
and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also this</font>

644
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,400
two-dimensional routing protocol to d IP

645
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,020
which basically uses source and

646
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,370
destination it's kind of similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

647
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,080
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work but it's actually a whole</font>

648
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,000
new routing protocol rather than just

649
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,840
enhancement to existing router protocols

650
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,010
to do this enhance<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming and go</font>

651
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,330
beyond that so obviously that's kind of

652
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,890
a long time line of other things that

653
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen and again I think phase two is</font>

654
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:20,090
kinda the most important thing but again

655
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">why is this important so I think we'll</font>

656
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">we all have kind of in our hands the</font>

657
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,250
future of home networks and we have a

658
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,660
choice here<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first choice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not to</font>

659
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,550
do anything right that's always a choice

660
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,600
do nothing which in my opinion kind of

661
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,790
leaves us<font color="#E5E5E5"> at phase one right we've</font>

662
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,780
already got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basic 6204 biz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

663
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,879
standard published so there's ipv6

664
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,399
router standards out there ipv4 routers

665
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,220
kind of just worked but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

666
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">about an increasing number of service</font>

667
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,759
calls as things go on is things become

668
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">more complex broken service discovery</font>

669
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,839
home right so DLNA relies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PMP</font>

670
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:52,099
which relies on being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send</font>

671
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,479
multicast throughout the home and if

672
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:56,599
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these NAT boundaries that</font>

673
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:58,389
breaks again with ipv6 you only have a

674
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,539
single router today<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no mechanism</font>

675
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:04,248
it's not standardized are defined for

676
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,089
subtending routers off of it and then

677
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,469
again if you're selling these IP

678
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,849
services into the home you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an</font>

679
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:09,109
unknown environment right so there's a

680
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:10,639
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hacks and a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work around a</font>

681
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,689
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you have to guess at to</font>

682
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,488
decide what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that home network</font>

683
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,899
environment look like before I can you

684
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:17,389
know so into it I'm have a common

685
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:18,849
platform so the other choice right now

686
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:21,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward into Phase two which</font>

687
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:24,289
in my estimation would be the hip net

688
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:26,718
solution which itself configuring gives

689
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,339
you an actual whole home network where

690
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:30,019
you're actually routing across the

691
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,299
entire home and you know service

692
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:33,769
discovery works many other things kind

693
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,509
of just work because the routing in the

694
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:37,579
home is actually works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it provides</font>

695
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:39,079
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> common platform for IP services you</font>

696
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:41,269
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this known entity that's known</font>

697
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:45,678
quantity of what you're selling into in

698
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:47,869
the home so the reason I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving this</font>

699
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,219
talk is did I want you all to help you

700
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:51,439
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> support the hip net internet-draft</font>

701
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:53,149
there's a link to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we're also</font>

702
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,039
planning on<font color="#E5E5E5"> publishing open source code</font>

703
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:57,228
the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we demonstrated at the</font>

704
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,219
last IETF right now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite</font>

705
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:00,589
published yet so if you're interested

706
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:02,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email me directly and I can let</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you know when it's available and then of</font>

708
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,049
course building<font color="#CCCCCC"> if net solution if</font>

709
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,969
you're a vendor right building your next

710
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:09,139
home router based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> depth net so you</font>

711
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:11,179
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually works in</font>

712
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:14,359
the customer's home for x multiplied

00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:15,589
outer complex topologies within cable

714
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,208
<font color="#CCCCCC">ads we have the e</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router specification</font>

716
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:21,499

00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:24,769
the internet draft for kind of more just

718
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:26,359
off the shelf routers and what we really

719
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:27,919
need is industry alignment and vendor

720
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,839
engagement around this entire solution

721
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,199
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the best</font>

722
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible quality of what can come out of</font>

723
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is if everyone does the same thing</font>

724
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,429
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the civil point of standardization</font>

725
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,439
and so looking at you know having this

726
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:41,899
common home IP network that just works

727
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,579
and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only as a super spreader you</font>

728
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:45,228
have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> service calls but as a geek</font>

729
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:48,469
you know to take service calls right

730
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:51,519
from family members and friends with

731
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:51,519

732
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,620

questions or someone who wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> poke</font>

734
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">holes maybe not today</font>
