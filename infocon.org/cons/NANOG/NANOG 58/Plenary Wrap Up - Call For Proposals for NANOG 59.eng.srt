to pull all this together staff come

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:10,520
from ms vera lan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to piece some of</font>

38
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,860
the nanog 58 statistics that I thought

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,620
you all might be interested in in seeing

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,300
I'll not advance these so quickly

41
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,730
because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of data on there I</font>

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,880
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also post this information on our</font>

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,280
website so that you can refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:30,470
interesting point for me is we did reach

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:34,280
that 500 mark which is good but only 475

46
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:38,359
actually came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and got a</font>

47
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,300
and our on-site some statistics about

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,970
the countries that are here when you

49
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:46,730
register you we ask you to identify what

50
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,370
country you come from and pretty

51
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:53,269
standard data that we see meeting to

52
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:58,150
meeting top organizations that have 10

53
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:00,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">or more folks here at this meeting and</font>

54
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,810
some organization description talked

55
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the board a little earlier about</font>

56
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,670
changing some of these definitions

57
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:11,209
because they're sort of legacy

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,280
categories and folks can move in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and out</font>

59
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:16,280
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

60
