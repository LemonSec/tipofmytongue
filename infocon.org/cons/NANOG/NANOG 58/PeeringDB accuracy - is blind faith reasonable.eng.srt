okay next up you up Snyder's are you

here there is okay we've got you<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking about hearing DB accuracy hi I</font>

4
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:25,769
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit about how</font>

accurate the data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> empirically and</font>

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,419
what that might mean for you as a

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,670
that I became inspired to some research

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:49,440
in this area I also recently joined the

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:53,100
peering to be admin team and I do suffer

into a website based on PHP and on that

20
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:17,130

26
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:37,079
it made life so much easier than

men team that are truly dedicated and

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,250
they spent hours per day munching

33
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,149
through tickets and helping users to get

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,610
this running the data itself similar to

44
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:32,489
you can lie all you want nobody will

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,920
check this information and in the left

46
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,349
side you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see various nuggets of</font>

52
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,459

54
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,099
recommend using this because it tends to

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit slow also every night</font>

56
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:09,329
around one or 2am Standard Time dump of

57
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,750
the sequel database is published on an

58
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,900
HTTP URL and you can import that on your

59
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,030
own sequel server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hammer the hell</font>

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,980
out of that and then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

61
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,880
the web interface which I showed in the

62
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:27,179
previous slides in the future we hope to

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,299
offer restful api swith kinky keywords

64
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">such as jason or maybe even if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> xml</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

65
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:37,380
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the future we don't have</font>

66
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:43,350
that today now what we're going to

67
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:46,230
discuss is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big question how useful</font>

68
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,450
is to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the submitted data in peering</font>

69
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">leeby can i actually just import the</font>

70
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,358
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really run my tools against</font>

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:59,459
this and use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to semi automatically</font>

72
00:03:53,359 --> 00:04:03,480
turn up HP sessions to address this

73
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:06,209
problem we<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure there are two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

74
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,340
data sources out there one is the data

75
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,500
source or data set that we want to

76
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">validate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the beat the sequel</font>

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,060
dump and the other one that is very

78
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:21,120
useful as actual show bgp summary

79
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,130
outputs from real networks will throw

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,710
this all together in one giant cocktail

81
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:30,300
and then go over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> brazil</font>

82
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's to collect those show bgp summaries</font>

83
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">i created a small website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> research top</font>

84
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,770
hearing the be calm and last week i

85
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,319
emailed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to people i visit</font>

86
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:47,940
this website submit your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and help</font>

87
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:49,860
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> assessing the accuracy on the</font>

88
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,690
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a big input fields</font>

89
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,310
where you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy paste from</font>

90
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:59,099
your cisco brocade iOS XR and juniper

91
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,590
and a gigantic monstrous regular

92
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:05,039
expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input and</font>

93
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:07,770
figure out what the clearing sessions

94
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,110
look like so from this example you'll

95
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,299
see quite some established sessions and

96
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,539
those are of interest and there's also

97
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,520
one or two shutdown sessions and we

98
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:21,419
throw those away because they mean

99
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,609
nothing in this research you press

100
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,469
submit and the website would<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

101
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,090
feedback is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this what you want to submit</font>

102
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,150
and the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> would try and figure out</font>

103
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,520
which sessions are actually on IX piece

104
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,729
and which are not and discard everything

105
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,948
that is not relevant so information<font color="#E5E5E5"> such</font>

106
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:40,409
as how many prefixes you send or how

107
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">many you receive it doesn't matter the</font>

108
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:46,050
only thing that mattered was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remote</font>

109
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,000
IP and a remote ASM and by submitting

110
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,370
data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this website you would confirm</font>

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you have seen an established</font>

112
00:05:50,370 --> 00:06:01,860
session with this IP and asn quite some

113
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:05,340
networks contributed data to this small

114
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,860
work among some white some big networks

115
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,570
also a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small networks it came</font>

116
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,520
from all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the place in total 33,500</font>

117
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,820
bgp sessions were submitted through this

118
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,039
tool and a my opium it was quite a good

119
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,199
number it was spread over two hundred

120
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,530
fifty six individual submissions and

121
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,909
this is ran for like seven days so not

122
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:33,059
too shabby so data source one are

123
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">peering DB data set that we want to</font>

124
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,790
verify today in peering<font color="#CCCCCC"> the be there are</font>

125
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,560
roughly

126
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,600
4700 networks registered and that

127
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">represents about ten percent of the</font>

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:52,360

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,120
are connections are describes at the

130
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,460
bottom you see such an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is our</font>

132
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,840
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we list our IP for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address in a</font>

133
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,800
record and in a separate record we list

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,270
our ipv6 address there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15,000</font>

138
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:20,140
far char 128 it has to be unique but you

139
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,170
can essence put anything you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want there</font>

140
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,960
and I've noticed they're quite some

141
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:29,920
people use this freedom to describe

142
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,380
impossible garbage I especially like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

143
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,480
second IP in this list because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

144
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,510
the guy was trying to combine the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font>

145
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:41,670
of ipv4 and ipv6 and stick that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one</font>

146
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:44,920
string well but this a lot of this is

147
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,990

corresponding entries in the peering DB

204
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,360
number is that we validated forty-three

I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scientist this represents a</font>

extrapolations only 64 IP addresses

211
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,960
resulted in what I call a conflict where

212
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,320
what was seen in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wild deviated from</font>

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:31,720
what was registered in peering to be

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:34,040
alcione zoom in on those 64 IP addresses

215
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,790
fifty-seven of those were IP four

216
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,099
sessions and I I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through all 64 of</font>

217
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,110
them to try and figure out why what was

220
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:51,430
sixty percent of those entries that were

221
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,599
in conflict were actually IP addresses

222
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,060

227
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,600
you could kind of figure this out by

228
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at the dates of when the last</font>

231

232
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,060
something we as admins need to figure

they want to keep hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they'll</font>

242
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,240
just give up and use local ass to keep

that session up and running fourteen

244

<font color="#CCCCCC">clue why what I saw in the show bgp</font>

00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:47,099

261
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,709
this means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-nine percent of</font>

262
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:53,459
the data impairing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leiby is actually</font>

263
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:55,319
correct and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> flabbergasted because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

264
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:59,449
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be seventy-five percent</font>

265
00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:02,029
so that's why I included the next slide

266
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:04,920
ninety-nine percent guys it's awesome

267
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:09,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this means we can really use peering</font>

268
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:12,420
Libby and everybody should use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

269
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:15,599
fortune in essence is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

270
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,509
so if one out of every hundred peering

271
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,910
sessions that you set up go wrong that's

272
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:25,079
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good score it will lower the</font>

274
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,579
in mind that scrubbing the data that you

275
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,519
get from keyring to be is worth the

276
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:35,219
effort you'll easily yield a few hundred

277
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,860
extra IP addresses from appearing to be

278
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:42,329
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would optimize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scrubber a</font>

279
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:45,839

00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:48,239
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we salvaged seventy-five</font>

admins will talk about whether it is

284
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,050
acceptable to force a little bit of

scrubbing on this should it be well text

286
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,219
or not or should we make a separate

287
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:07,349
comment fields and a separate IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

288
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,019
which can never be anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> than an</font>

289
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:14,699
IP address we'll figure that out at some

and an ipv6 address on the same line

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:42,079
say like give me the most the entries

that were updated most recently and this

318
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,270
will be a nice feature because you can

319
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,949
have the old records from networks that

320
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,350
left internet exchanges you don't have

321
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:54,620
to touch their data but you allow new

322
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,690
commerce that got that recycled IP

323
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,839
address and they update it more recently

324
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,240
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably more accurate we could</font>

325
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,780
do stuff like that maybe it's worth

326
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,809
while maintaining this feedback loop

327
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,030

today so we looked at your dad I'm we

343
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,340
actually talked about this sorry

345
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,000
something we discussed but I think it's

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,770
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group we talked about</font>

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and you for instance notice that</font>

348
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,270
Akamai had some data that would

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">mismatched because we were locally</font>

asking some peers<font color="#E5E5E5"> do do legacy stuff</font>

351
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,630
where does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fit into your data and</font>

352
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,100
with if did you look at how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">were doing something like that did that</font>

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,280
make you a higher or doesn't matter

355
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:30,440
because the ninety-nine percent kind of

356
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,300
washed over that anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so for</font>

360

let others know that they are in the

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,960
somewhat like an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> there where no</font>

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">be good to have that option so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i am in</font>

390
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:15,840
I agree one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strong things about</font>

391
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,490
appearing to be is actually the fact

392
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can put in whatever data you</font>

393
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,730
want and I originally I was like no it

394
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,918
all must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be strict and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we must force</font>

395
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,500
people to enter IP addresses otherwise

396
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,779
my script doesn't work but others

397
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,809
pointed out well it's maybe your few but

398
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,130
other people like you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to list</font>

399
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:38,010
at their present and not necessarily

400
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,590
disclose more information than they deem

401
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,600
needed so in a new appearing to be

402
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,418
iteration I think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good to</font>

403
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,320
make all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data optional but that</font>

404
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:52,679
you could classify what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

405
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,710
means so instead of having a mixed IP /

406
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,870
commons / empty<font color="#E5E5E5"> field you could have</font>

407
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,450
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like don't publish my IP</font>

408

address or this is a comment regarding

409
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,240
the connection so it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier for</font>

410
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,620
parsers to figure out what the data

411
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,309
means yet keeping that freedom of what
