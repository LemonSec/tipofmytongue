hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I'm crispy I'm a network</font>

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,489
engineer at softlayer technologies

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,370
together with my boss when Tim Tim we

8
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,510
came up with an idea for ipv4

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:45,300
conservation method that we are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:49,230
employ in our networks so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue that</font>

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,650
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run into is that we have when we bind</font>

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,750
a subnet to an interface we waste three

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,550
IPS just naturally with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,670
gateway and broadcast addresses sorry

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,949
this is my first time if one or two

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,240
servers are assigned to subnet the most

17
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,020
common allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to give</font>

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,910
is a / 29 but when we do this we end up

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,830
wasting more IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact in</font>

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">this scenario we waste now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 addresses</font>

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,640
we have our three that we normally

22
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasted plus the three that are unused in</font>

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,520
the subnet and that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like that</font>

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,039
might not seem like a lot of addresses

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,340
are being wasted but whenever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

26
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:31,290
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this across multiple routers you</font>

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,689
see that you start exhausting addresses

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,990
quite quickly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in markets like a pack</font>

29
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,869
and Europe where the maximum allocation

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,289
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> / 20 to 80 subspace pretty quickly</font>

31
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,630
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see an example of what I'm</font>

32
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,780
discussing you have customer a which has

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,460
two servers and a subnet and you have

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,030
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> B which has two servers in the</font>

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,470
subnet they both<font color="#E5E5E5"> have / 29 s and so here</font>

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,850
we've we burnt the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 IPS and</font>

37
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,280
so what happens whenever one of the

38
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,320
customers grows and adds more servers

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,640
well most likely they won't do it

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,229
immediately they'll do it after a few

41
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,440
months which means we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

42
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,900
contiguous block to assign them so what

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,090
happens is now we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this issue we</font>

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,070
have to give them a whole other / 29 and

45
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,870
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same customer and</font>

46
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,940
depending on what how many servers they

47
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,260
actually add we end up burning even more

48
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:28,049
IPS from unused space and then what

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,920
happens if you need a a first top of

50
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">redundancy protocol such as hsrp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RV RRP</font>

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,970
more justice get used and even though

52
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might not seem like a big deal now</font>

53
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,120
what happened in a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years</font>

54
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,650
whenever

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,739
you go to broker to receive more<font color="#CCCCCC"> IVs so</font>

56
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,599
the solution move to ipv6 we've been

57
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,920
dual stack for a while and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

58
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">is you just can't make everybody else</font>

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,179
move to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and so you have a</font>

60
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:59,310
dependency<font color="#E5E5E5"> still on before is there a</font>

61
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,489
more efficient way why does it have to

62
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,840
be a publicly routable IP the only place

63
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,120
where the gateway address is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,340
used is as a link-local address for

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,930
servers to get the mac address and the

66
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,819
source IP for the router directly

67
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected for host communication the</font>

68
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual forwarding of packets destined</font>

69
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,958
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the remote networks don't actually</font>

70
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,819
reference the before address so here we

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
looked at which ones we could use none

72
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,450
Rob non-routable space we could use RFC

73
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,459
1918 space we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use RFC 3927 space</font>

74
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:35,790
but we believe the best choice would be

75
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:37,799
RFC 65 98 why not RFC 1918 well it was

76
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,358
published<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while ago in 96 you're</font>

77
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,440
probably already using it elsewhere in

78
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,200
your network for out-of-band management

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,660
or whatnot and it can potentially

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,319
confuse up staff and customers to see

81
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:54,720
that on there publicly facing interface

82
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:57,060
also why not RFC night 3927 well if you

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,709
do try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it a lot of systems with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dhcp clients will automatically</font>

85
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,370
configure themselves into this space and

86
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,488
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of runs into a problem of</font>

87
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:09,180
manageability you lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> control of what</font>

88
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:13,739
addresses are being used where so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

89
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:16,709
okay to use RFC 65 98 it's actually

90
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,180
reserved for carrier-grade NAT but we

91
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,310
believe in our scenario that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font>

92
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,660
this if it's configured properly you

93
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,639
shouldn't interfere with other uses in

94
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,410
your network and in fact provisioning

95
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,419
system should allow it and you can

96
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,310
design small part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this block just for</font>

97
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,240
this purpose and reuse it on other

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,490
because you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do one-to-one nat</font>

107
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,159
a lot of our obviously ports that are

to a broker and buy some ip's going to a

twenty-five cents an IP if all the hours

116

are out of ip's the price of ips will be

117
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:20,410
a lot higher obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> three IPS just for network</font>

basically wasting 67,500 dollars on just

<font color="#E5E5E5">network it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting more expensive so</font>

128
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,020
how does our concept work well adding

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,539
one of the subnets will cause unicast

130
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,240
RPF to allow traffic source from the

131
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,699
subnet so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an ECL that</font>

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,130
prevents<font color="#E5E5E5"> this do not advertise the space</font>

255
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,740
converting this to a first hop

256
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,750
redundancy protocol or hsrp is that most

257
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,270
vendor implementations require you use

258
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,890
IPS within the subnet that you're using

259
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,300
so now what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do is you have</font>

260
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to your customer and ask for them</font>

261
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:02,589
to give you back IPS so here we can see

262
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,390
our attempted configuration on a cisco

263
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,190
you can see it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take it and</font>

264
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:10,300
it will complain but then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

265
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,370
at the actual hsrp state it'll show you

266
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,630
in an interface down and it will tell

267
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,680
you it's the wrong subnet for the

268
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:20,470
interface here we tried it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again with a</font>

269
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,569
juniper and again all the way up<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

270
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,890
you try to commit it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> take it and then</font>

271
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,600
as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you commit it will complain</font>

272
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,880
about the IP not being in the same

273
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,910
subnet now here's the virtual example we

274
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,670
arista z/os you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

275
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,280
statically configure a mac address and

276
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:42,689
so and in fact this example can work if

277
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,970
you'd like and then you can add your 164

278
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,640
space like you normally do and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

279
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,400
have your virtual router address and

280
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:54,449
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can also static route your / 29</font>

281
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:56,730
or whatever subnet to the interface so

282
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,470
we've discussed this with a couple of

283
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,690
different vendors and it couldn't get

284
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,040
additional support from the community so

285
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,220
if it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an interesting option</font>

286
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,870
bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> account team and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">scott lebreton light white so it sounds</font>

290
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,410
like this requires some unusual

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,670
configuration on behalf of your

292
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,110
customers and configuring their servers

293
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,189
in that they have to configure a gateway

294
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,050
that's not in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal subnet have you</font>

295
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,690
gave an example of CentOS<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it works</font>

296
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,800
fine there have you seen any examples of

297
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,839
customer equipment that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

298
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is it an additional support</font>

299
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,010
headache to get customers to explain it

300
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,500
to them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get them to configure it and</font>

301
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,120
all that so at softlayer we have an

302
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,250
automated provisioning system so

303
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,860
whenever we provision the server it will

304
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,399
be set up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway and</font>

305
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,420
the static route for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway already</font>

306
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,829
so far we haven't run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> any problems</font>

307
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,219
with the different os's that we've

308
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:12,290
tested as i mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows 2003</font>

309
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,510
requires a net SH but two thousand eight

310
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,910
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty twelve will both allow you to</font>

311
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,420
do it through the GUI and then we've

312
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,860
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> Debian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sandoz red hat even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FreeBSD</font>

313
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,229
they all seem take configuration just

314
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine ok I miss the part that you guys</font>

315
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,399
were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration for the</font>

316
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:33,529
customers that make sense sorry yes

317
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,160
hello i Donna Royce min with a soft

318
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:38,839
layer did a great job I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

319
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,670
also point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the reasons</font>

320
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,350
that we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is</font>

321
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,899
still kind of an experimental phase

322
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,730
we've proven it works we haven't used it

323
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,010
very widely but we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> eager to hear</font>

324
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,170
back from anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else who may have tried</font>

325
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">this who is trying this who's already</font>

326
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,290
run into some problems or pitfalls

327
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,939
people who think this is interesting

328
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,319
sexy exciting and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

329
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,269
themselves and want more information etc

330
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:01,729
so if you've done anything like this

331
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:03,709
before you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> eliminated this as</font>

332
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,569
an option please you know that we have a

333
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:09,459
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes now and be nice to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

334
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:09,459

335
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,480
okay you talked a little bit about how

336
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,980
your duels dr. v6 but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the</font>

337
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,370
greatest uptake do you have any

338
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,420
strategies for browbeating customers and

339
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,430
you know take it was interesting

340
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,050
compared to that John Kearns a slide

341
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,870
about number of ISPs who don't yet

342
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:32,170
appear to have v6 well imitations yeah

343
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,190
in the hosting environment our customers

344
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,290
customers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the end users</font>

345
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,509
the eyeballs and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really as the</font>

346
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,290
eyeballs networks start to adopt v6

347
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:44,509
would probably see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a greater yep a</font>

348
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,819
greater uptake on v6 utilization but

349
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:49,339
until pretty much all the eyeballs are

350
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:59,300
updated to v6 we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

00:14:49,339 --> 00:15:03,350
dependency on before Lee Howard Time

tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's afternoon and again again</font>

356
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:15,319
tomorrow morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> iball networks have</font>

357
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:19,310
more motivation to deploy v6 if there's

358
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:20,660
content available or v6 we should be

359
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,630
able to walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> and chew gum at the same</font>

360
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,130
time sure it's not wait for each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

361
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,300
actually like<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

362
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is you know that this was pretty</font>

363
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,769
clever my first response when you said

364
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,990
164 was to say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> come on that's a wheel</font>

365
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:35,300
and I looked at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said yeah you</font>

366
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,100
know what as long as you're using

367
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,569
internally and I never see that route I

368
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,730
don't care what<font color="#E5E5E5"> address block you use</font>

369
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:43,490
you can use any address block internally

370
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,620
and that just finds your network so no

371
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,949
this is good stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks excellent</font>

372
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,949
thanks

373
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,350
