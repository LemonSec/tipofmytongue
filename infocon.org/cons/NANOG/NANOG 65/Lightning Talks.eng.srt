1
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:15,650
so next up<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three lightning talks</font>

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,520
talk will be a Chris Moreau are

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,520
ki operations

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hey hi I'm Chris I work with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google this</font>

5
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,230
isn't really google talk but there's

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,430
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google stuff in it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great read</font>

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine print I'm not going to talk</font>

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">about any legal crap who decide what to</font>

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,440
sign I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right now</font>

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,699
some point in time hopefully people will

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,739
see value in the RPG I system in we can

12
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:54,309
operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> one as opposed to discussing all</font>

13
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:56,379
the politics if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the</font>

14
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">rpi system is the the quick and dirty is</font>

15
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:02,680
it's basically a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki system to manage</font>

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,770
authorization for access authorization

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,229
to call it at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the day you</font>

00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign some stuff this is I should step</font>

21
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:18,190
back there's two kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prevailing</font>

22
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:21,119
versions for this process<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's talk</font>

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:25,300
to your rir<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron or ripe or whoever and</font>

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,100
have them be you the CA you talk to them

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,210
and they publish stuff for you and they

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,470
manage all the publication for you

27
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,539
that's actually pretty easy so if you're

28
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,369
a small place so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really care a</font>

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,439
lot about running this infrastructure

30
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:39,460
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great option for you if you're</font>

31
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,350
larger like you're an AT&T or Google is

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,279
going to probably do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you want to</font>

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,720
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more control of your</font>

service the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rer will sign stuff down</font>

36
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:49,900
toward you you'll publish stuff out you

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain all this stuff been</font>

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,290
right you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to maintain</font>

39
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,829
servers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not some other stuff that's</font>

40
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this talk is about so at the end of</font>

41
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:59,079
the day after you do all some signing

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,240
with certificates in this and that and

43
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,149
keys you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> an arcing server</font>

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,140
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not magic so how do you run</font>

45
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,060
an arcing server and you make it

46
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">available across more than just your</font>

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,350
local enterprise network hopefully this

48
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,140
is what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about there's a couple</font>

49
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,670
other presentations that talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPG</font>

50
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,109
I and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more detail if you don't</font>

51
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,480
know what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest you look</font>

52
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,709
at those two links hopefully the PDF

53
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,018
shows up someplace and the links are

54
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:26,500
usable if not mail me and i'll send<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

55
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:29,890
links or you could search on patch com

56
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,480
which is what I did so you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

57
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,940
arcing server you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage them</font>

58
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,410
keys and stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep those private if</font>

59
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,879
coming to get your keys they can assign

60
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,900
resources if so they were used so you

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,250
probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want that so you want to</font>

62
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep those relatively secure</font>

63
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,670
and then you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> which data you</font>

64
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,480
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the world probably</font>

65
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,859
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to do this all in one</font>

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,220
server out on the public internet that's

67
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the best idea maybe and maybe not</font>

68
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,040
all of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is accessible to everybody in</font>

69
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world just the stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually</font>

70
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,100
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish not your keys so in</font>

71
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,450
looking at this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google I said well I</font>

72
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,590
can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on all of our production</font>

73
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,910
stuff which would make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy and not</font>

74
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,110
my problem we have to do build it

75
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,460
somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't really run an</font>

76
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:12,590
arsenic service for some reason it's a

77
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:15,650
it's a web company so complicated so in

78
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,090
any case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided to use our cloud</font>

79
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,250
infrastructure to deploy a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

80
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and at the end of the day I you</font>

81
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,330
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> followed the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process that is</font>

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,270
outlined<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one page install that</font>

83
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:31,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">rpi not publishers that's Randy's not</font>

84
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:33,260
site but it's Randy's work and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

85
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,120
currently not publishing public stuff

86
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,320
for publishing stuff through Randy's

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,450
things so we're not the greatest example

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,890
here but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day we just</font>

89
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">have area and sign all my stuff in</font>

90
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,109
follow the same process<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm doing here</font>

91
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,670
so follow the if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font>

92
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,770
you take one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reference platforms</font>

93
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:52,700
there's only really two available sorry

94
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,900
there's only one available if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

95
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,429
gonna if you're going to be your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> CI</font>

96
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,890
and that's the art<font color="#CCCCCC"> Poquette annette</font>

97
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:02,780
reference platform you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I chose to make</font>

98
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,339
one server private and keep all of my

99
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,780
keys and whatnot on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm probably</font>

100
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do that for the long term as</font>

101
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,950
well and then whatever it gets created

102
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,510
for my publication point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just rsync</font>

103
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,890
out to the world up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my set of servers</font>

104
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,170
that are available to everybody to talk

105
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,459
to I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together some puppet stuff</font>

106
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,039
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not completely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and not</font>

107
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:22,729
published<font color="#E5E5E5"> here because our open source</font>

108
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,770
process is longer than I thought but

109
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,300
eventually it'll you'll see the

110
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,030
management framework that I put together

111
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,410
here it's puppet<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we could build</font>

112
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,460
ansible or something else if people are

113
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,740
interested in something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

114
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:38,630
puppet I just happen to learn puppet so

115
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,130
I got stuck the key point with all of

116
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,570
the publication stuff is if you're a

117
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,070
large organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you change your</font>

118
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,800
data on a regular basis there some fear

119
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,760
that as you change your manifest which

120
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,110
tells everybody what's in your

121
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,490
repository you change parts of the

122
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,750
repository that as people come through

123
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,870
and gather you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know when</font>

124
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,010
the

125
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,330
going to do this they may get half the

126
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:57,830
data part the data missing things I

127
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,539
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I realized is if I just</font>

128
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,070
publish a brand new copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

129
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a new place in point our sink at the</font>

130
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,380
new place every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I finish publishing</font>

131
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,000
everyone always gets the current when

132
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,430
they start form of data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,490
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it underneath them so the the</font>

134
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,750
management framework does that for you I

135
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,580
think that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that slide there's</font>

136
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,080
any questions people should speak up but

137
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,219
so after you get all this stuff

138
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,620
published then what would I do with it

139
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,940
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would if I was an ISP I would be</font>

140
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,970
filtering my customers because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

141
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">my last job if you're not like really</font>

142
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:36,950
seriously people it's not hard we should

143
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,270
do this but presuming that you you know

144
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you find it complicated for some reason</font>

145
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can take the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> irr</font>

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,560
there's lots of documentation how to do

147
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,659
that there's two presentations about I

148
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,650
are our tools and another one somebody

149
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,390
can jump on them i can tell me who it

150
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,270
was earlier this week which is a good

151
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,560
presentation you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those things</font>

152
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the data and say wow</font>

153
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,970
this is really cruddy data<font color="#E5E5E5"> missed and</font>

154
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">write both kind of agree that it's not</font>

155
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best in the world but with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rpi</font>

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,599
data if the if the customer of yours

157
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,460
signs there prefixes or you sign

158
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,830
prefixes for them you could at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

159
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,109
take that data and bounce it against the

160
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">irr data and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well instead of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

161
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,230
prefixes con Edison is no longer a

162
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:21,440
customer of NTT so will you know not let

163
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:22,640
them send that route to us so some

164
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,230
examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that you can use</font>

165
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,479
the who is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are poquette at net</font>

166
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,730
service to kind of ask it for for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rohit</font>

167
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,130
data so you could get the RR data and

168
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,540
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpi dotnet for the right thing you</font>

169
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">could build and who is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> version of that</font>

170
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,620
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probably bug Randy about</font>

171
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to get that code up and running</font>

172
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,020
somewhere else and put it into the same

173
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,760
management package and at the very least

174
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,349
you could stand up a server or sorry a

175
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,390
router off path you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it with</font>

176
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,370
quagga bird you do with a real router

177
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,310
junipers and Cisco's both support the

178
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,510
validation code you can take all the

179
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,860
road in EU gather from the rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

180
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,719
world you can shovel it into this box

181
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,290
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can look at the prefixes that you</font>

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,270
see mark them good bad or whatever and

183
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,100
then take some metrics on what the world

184
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,580
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you and then if you have</font>

185
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,259
customer

186
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,789
or your own data that's a problem you

187
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,780
can go fix that hopefully and know

188
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,400
what's going to happen if you have to

189
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,859
end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the data later in the</font>

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,580
production<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network sorry that was that</font>

191
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:30,620
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick because any</font>

192

questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> three two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

193
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,509
thanks a lot Chris next up we have jose

194
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,129
santos he'll be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a talk on training</font>

195
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:40,090
the next generation of network engineers

196
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,090
or plumbers

197
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,120
thank you

198
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:58,360
sorry I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to no need to get my</font>

199
00:07:53,529 --> 00:08:00,069
glasses um the message on I'm bringing

200
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">today salut be less traditional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

201
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:03,759
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about protocols but rather</font>

202
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:07,059
about the people who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very likely to</font>

203
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,159
replace you in the near future my

204
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:10,300
perspective is from the academic

205
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,819
environment and trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address the</font>

206
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,349
challenges of the industry as they show

207
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:18,039
up today and that's it going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show up</font>

208
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,539
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next few years if I ask some of</font>

209
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">you what's the definition of the perfect</font>

210
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,979
never engineers I mean having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

211
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:25,360
never-ending list you know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only you</font>

212
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:28,119
meet you know protocols you need to know

213
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,009
the limitations of protocols we need to

214
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:31,889
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to touch equipment but also be</font>

215
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to automate some of the processes</font>

216
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:39,549
be able to develop code custom I mean

217
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:43,328
the list is endless and but keeps<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

218
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:45,189
out I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of white hair or no hair</font>

219
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:48,008
on this room well guess what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

220
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,149
aging pretty fast and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace</font>

221
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:53,740
talent as quickly as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can so not only</font>

222
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,759
that you have to be an engineer but also

223
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,850
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to communicate</font>

224
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:03,360
socialize be professional I'll be honest

225
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,360
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that person doesn't exist today</font>

226
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,250
they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few very handful of them so</font>

227
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,139
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to even just expand any one</font>

228
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,970
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> dimensions well you know basic</font>

229
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:13,959
networking tool kids we have like 20

230
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,579
different protocols but also

231
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,050
intersection between these protocols you

232
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:19,719
know Bishop is no longer the purest

233
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,969
protocol now it's integrative mpls with

234
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,839
layer two tunneling layer 3 tunneling

235
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,339
and so on so how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer this set</font>

236
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:34,930
of knowledge or<font color="#CCCCCC"> these knowledge base</font>

237
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:36,610
into our students today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think based on</font>

238
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,959
my personal experience and perhaps some

239
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,230
share experience with some of the

240
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,329
members I discussing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past education</font>

241
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,790
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the only dimension education is</font>

242
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:47,859
not the only way we can solve the demand

243
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,750
of our industry it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> combinational</font>

244
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,490
skills but also<font color="#CCCCCC"> combination of training</font>

245
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that training has to be offering</font>

246
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:57,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">very particular environments experience</font>

247
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:59,768
over time making mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a necessity</font>

248

master's program a two-year degree plan

257
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,890
that can be achievable with the

prevailing random professional from any

at this age and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gave me the</font>

visibility to understand the logic

network consolidation blah blah blah I

333
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:30,429
mean if you can share that<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

with us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be great other ways</font>

337
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,459
mean we were able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring a lot more</font>

students this particular year and

340
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:47,589

of that model is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that only works with</font>

earlier time the new generation of not

anything that is going to be IT related

351
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:16,660
needs to understand the complexity of

one particular experiment our generation

should build on data center

427
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,520
architectures to have you should be able

428
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,840
to amend your scripting skills and they

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,290
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a much better results by</font>

us as much feedback as you can I mean it

433
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,930
will take probably five to ten minutes

434
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,820
of your time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just give us up the</font>

these internship programs having

guidance on how to interview how to

452
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,070
write a resume because I wouldn't want

453
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:45,259
any of these valuable skills to get lost

454
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,549
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can't find a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job at a</font>

their ideas concisely we do help them

460
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,678
with resume presentations but remember a

00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,929
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours we've not did not get that</font>

462
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,149
help you know we are engineers we're

463
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,970
isolated we just care about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer</font>

464
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:10,549
and we don't socialize I think this I

465
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,359
mean it's something has to be built on

466
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:16,039
top we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular effort will</font>

467
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,269
do that particular effort on the side we

<font color="#CCCCCC">soft skills that also are desirable by</font>

473
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,210
the market and it boils down to

474
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">communication writing skills and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

get people influence quickly early in

their career another point to make also

493
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:13,190
about internships is that we actually

494
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">have college students work in very</font>

critical parts of the product so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

are actually organizations who've

<font color="#CCCCCC">the extensive documentation so well for</font>

anchor management and negative trust

shows themselves in the foot<font color="#CCCCCC"> with not</font>

542
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:34,190
resigning their zones so some

<font color="#CCCCCC">technically details it's written in c</font>

544
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> legit so it's it's very fast and</font>

545
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,490
it's scriptable and it has dynamic

546
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,500
configuration in lua so you can write

547
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,080
programs in the configuration which is

548
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,650
just very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and i would show you but</font>

549
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,290
we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough time for that it is</font>

550
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,050
very simple core just<font color="#E5E5E5"> free modules</font>

551
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:59,920
iterator cash validator but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

552
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:03,020
extensible the modules in ceylon go and

553
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,780
we even ship some of them or use like

554
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,180
well policies views response policy

555
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:12,500
zones and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will talk about</font>

556
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:16,130
them we also support ipv6 from the start

557
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:20,450
with well some tweaks to to make the

558
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:22,820
eyeballs happy and it well<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Declan</font>

559
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,770
perspective it doesn't do treading but

560
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,540
it scales by self reputation you just

561
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:31,460
fire up<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instance on the same</font>

562
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:34,280
port and it works um so who is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

563
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:38,470
well visit for everybody for large

564
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:41,030
recursive DNS farms it's very scalable

565
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:45,920
it's very flexible because you can write

566
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:49,010
your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> strips into that well we have</font>

567
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,350
statistic metrics and well you can expel

568
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">are those into graphite involved with</font>

569
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:57,230
some fancy new web stuff we have

570
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,930
negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> trances trust anchors and it's</font>

571
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,570
also cluster ever you can have a etcd

572
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,960
module<font color="#E5E5E5"> for replicated configuration</font>

573
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:08,929
across across the cluster it's also well

574
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,360
well sweetie for small recursos in

575
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:14,480
private networks it does qname

576
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,010
minimization which is the new stuff in

577
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:24,020
the DNS privacy well again<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the DNS</font>

578
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:26,510
SEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and key management automatically it</font>

579
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,150
has slow memory consumption you can even

580
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,160
Bob downscale the cash and it's also

581
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,650
good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your personal resolver in your</font>

582
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,700
laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact I am running it in for</font>

583
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:39,560
Paul several weeks now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and well we</font>

584
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,860
aren't some but bugs out and but it

585
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,980
works very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and it's very simple you</font>

586
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:49,570
just well give it a rich key and the

587
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,580
interface is to listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and that's it</font>

588
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:57,620
the cash is persistent across three

589
00:24:52,580 --> 00:25:00,110
starts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an reboot and we also plan</font>

590
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:03,560
for the future well do some stuff to

591
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:06,979
circumvent the horrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> well hotel wifis</font>

592
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:11,840
like the pheromone days which intercepts

593
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,370
all dns queries to all addresses this

594
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,540
this is the example of the graphite

595
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:22,310
module so it could draw all fancy graphs

596
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:26,000
if you are into that so what's the

597
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:27,980
current status of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project we are</font>

598
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,600
currently entering a better phase of the

599
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,330
project so it's it's ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

600
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,310
external testing but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said i'm</font>

601
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,560
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> running it on my laptop for</font>

602
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:41,120
several weeks and without any any

603
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:43,370
problems and so give it a try the

604
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,959
sources are available we also have a

605
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:50,989
docker scraped it that can install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

606
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,000
for you we have linux packages currently

607
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two but we will extend</font>

608
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,930
that shortly and for a strange stuff

609
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:01,880
well people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do in dms em and we</font>

610
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,640
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you about well</font>

611
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,970
any failure

612
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:10,220
sore or strange behavior or even success

613
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:14,400
story so so please give it a try and

614
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:17,040
well uh that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing we the</font>

cool thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you in season</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight we</font>

616
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,409
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have tourists omnia which is open</font>

617
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:28,680
hardware with the designs available open

618
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:31,380
source home router well check it out we

619
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,080
have no dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> alterative part of the dns</font>

620
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,180
server and you probably might know<font color="#E5E5E5"> birds</font>

621
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:41,850
the routine<font color="#E5E5E5"> demon this also comes from</font>

622
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:43,500
our stable so to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so i was faster</font>

623
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,320
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> i expected so we have time for</font>

624
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,470
questions if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all interested in</font>

625
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:55,409
asking something or throwing eggs or

626
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:58,380
tomatoes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> dogma Camarena's do you have</font>

627
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:00,440
a heuristics or built into the queue

628
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">name minimization to deal with</font>

629
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,200
authoritative<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah basically well</font>

630
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,500
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call best effort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

631
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">know minimization and it stops the zone</font>

632
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,620
cuts too well exactly sir commandos

633
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:19,290
strange stuff that CD ends for

634
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,929
procedural resolvers so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the</font>

635
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:26,850
strict<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hyun a minimization but it's</font>

636
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:29,910
tries to well answer you so too it is

637
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">much whatever techniques you use well</font>

638
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,970
documented somewhere either in the code

639
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:40,370
or um already after well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

640
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:42,780
now it's in the code basically but well

641
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:50,209
should be an email and we can talk about

642
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:50,210

<font color="#CCCCCC">dodgy so for large-scale</font>

651
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,870
recursive farms do you sell like

652

<font color="#E5E5E5">software support maintenance and all</font>

could you said it again so for

00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:28,929
large-scale recursive farms are you

656
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,470
planning to sell software maintenance to

657

sustainable so so we will well once<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

stabilized then we will offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a support</font>

662
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:55,390

<font color="#CCCCCC">and there's also going to be a talk on</font>

668
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,820
strategies for packet buffering inside

669
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,250
of routers and I believe that's in the
