in Canada ever so 912 people registered

4
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:29,950
so far the numbers probably going to be

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,540
a revised upward it wouldn't be

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,449
surprised if we see a thousand by the

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,980
end of the meeting which is crazy our

8
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:38,890

almost a thousand people so welcome and

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,309

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,050
understand that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,610
things is our membership and community
