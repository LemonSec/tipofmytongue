talk a little bit about that the in this

00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:24,788
talk I'm going to focus a little bit as

27
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:26,619
a review on net flow and the flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> alike</font>

28
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:28,990
protocols some of the functionality you

can do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also talk about some of</font>

30
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other data sources that you might</font>

31
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:33,729
have from the infrastructure from the

00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,589
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> end especially some of the</font>

33
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:37,959
people now<font color="#CCCCCC"> nods increasingly grown</font>

34
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,549
people that run servers run web

35
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,469
properties and so the infrastructure

36
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:42,759
becomes joined with the kind of

37
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:45,130
operational tools that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

38
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,920
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use things like web logs load</font>

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,590

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,469
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get from the</font>

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,029
infrastructure when I was running

43
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:00,158
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> at abovenet we had this</font>

44
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:03,700
customer called Akamai turned on anyone

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,289
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of akamai and they called me</font>

46
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,909
complaining that my unit connectivity

47
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:09,580
was borked which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could see you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know by</font>

48
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the standard you know Mount Sinai you</font>

49
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,870

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,160
all the sudden I realized here's a

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,780
customer has better data than our

52
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,069
network about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do and from then it's</font>

53
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,420
from then on it's always been

54
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting challenges how do we figure</font>

55
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,500
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just what the network's doing</font>

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,329
but what's the performance what's the

57
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,610
impact of it

58
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:32,910
so sounds like people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

59
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:35,130
flow anyone ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> run up 7206 vxr so some</font>

60
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,660
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early flow based routing awesome</font>

61
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,280
let's do flow routing that'll work fine

62
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,100
until you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have Ford source address</font>

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,660
packets and then you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so the early</font>

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,820
Smurfs and things like that that caused

65
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,280
issues but people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said way we could get</font>

66
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,040
this data out and actually see behind

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,430
the SNMP see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on after that</font>

68
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,100
came s flow which instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actually</font>

69
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,920
putting packets together into flows or

70
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,930
sort of sessions is just packet sampling

71
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,820
and actually something interesting to

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,280
think about s flow a lot of router

73
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,870
people's all usually a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the router world look at</font>

75
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,410
s flow is a switch type thing a lot of

76
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,899
routers can do it and if you're actually

77
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,299
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing DDoS detection real</font>

78
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,310
time looking at effects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your changes</font>

79
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,260
s lo is actually an interesting protocol

80
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,209
because you can see pretty accurately

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,459
the effects of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on just a</font>

82
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,230
couple seconds later was with flow you

83
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,300
need to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

84
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,429
aggregates to come through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's also</font>

85
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,769
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the routers so if you</font>

86
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,140
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at kinds of flow to enable I would</font>

87
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,310
encourage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to test s flow because</font>

88
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,018
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a lot easier to implement</font>

89
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just grabbing samples there's no</font>

90
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,540
hash tables and things that needs to

91
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:45,120
associate so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow v5 IP fix</font>

92
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">netflow v9 extensible flow protocols</font>

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,959
came about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk a little bit about</font>

94
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,309
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can do with</font>

95
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">templated export in IP fix and v9 that</font>

96
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,820
can be interesting for operators but

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,530
also at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk a little bit</font>

98
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,940
about sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lifetime and whether</font>

99
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,310
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right protocols going</font>

100
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,630
forward for carrying some of this some

101
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,310
of the NetFlow data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some of</font>

102
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">them were adamant to data so will say</font>

103
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,560
flow we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mean all of this stuff</font>

104
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the way that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,750
there's the basic flow which is the five

106
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:20,279
topple port ports and IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

107
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,810
protocol MAC address VLAN tag mpls all

108
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,789
those things that routers and switches

109
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,100
can export and then talk a little bit

110
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,260
about augmented flow which is URL

111
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,120
application performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> network latency</font>

112
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,580
some of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of the</font>

113
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,490
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices can get most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> devices</font>

114
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,080
support flow how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have blown</font>

115
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,039
up a device with flow

116
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,979
export related issues in the last year

117
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:46,110
ok so my assertion is it's gotten a lot

118
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,628
better a lot better than five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font>

119
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,490
certainly right in line<font color="#E5E5E5"> jay phlo it was</font>

120
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,199
out it didn't work then knew about it

121
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,120
now it sort of works now you need sampla

122
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,969
cater you know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't only sent</font>

123
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,229
it one place but basically the devices

124
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:00,210
can export flow you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get a pretty</font>

125
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:02,188
accurate view of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

126
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,900
save for beer discussion whether you

127
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,150
should ever bill based on flow like data

128
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,310
but from an engineering perspective it

129
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,039
works pretty well and there's a lot of

130
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,509
basic functionality that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can that</font>

131
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,789
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with flow which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just do</font>

132
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,919
a quick review on sounds like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

133
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:20,310
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so again the</font>

134
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,799
lace export i would say s flow where

135
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,659
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for traffic engineering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS</font>

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,879
detection but pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much all of the</font>

137
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,590
flow vendors are familiar with it you

138
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">can make it work on Cisco juniper</font>

139
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:36,029
brocade<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arista all the broadcom white</font>

140
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:39,779
box chips it works so state of the flow

141
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:43,830
tools they all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say pretty much</font>

142
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:45,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">sucked to some extent more or less in</font>

143
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,340

154
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,940
being a scaling challenge for people

155
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:15,210
also some things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp integration</font>

156
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:19,169
geo a lot of build it yourself you have

commercial software if you google net

159
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,779
flow is windows software that also runs

160
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,789
on one machine some of them have great

161
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,069
visualization visibility but also

162
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,469
similarly not really designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people</font>

00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:34,469
that run scalable infrastructure a lot

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:36,180
of the appliances mostly either take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,909
data aggregate it and throw it away or

166
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,979
are more security focus some of the

167
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,199
things that do full forensic store

everything or don't really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell</font>

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,919
to operators and then we see a lot of

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,139
tools groups working with it used to be

<font color="#CCCCCC">hadoop now it's more elastic search but</font>

172
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,800
this needs bigness

173
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,169
it's tens of servers and you still have

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,539
to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of a integration like BGP</font>

175
00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:01,049
and SNMP and net flow correlation up

176
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,729
front so the the key thing is we talked

177
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,250
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the other sources of data</font>

179
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,280
you look at flow tools try not to choose

180
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,960
a flow package or a flow processing

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,698
method or at least when you do think

182
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,919
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other kinds of data</font>

183
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,620
you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time and I'll point</font>

184
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,698
to some of the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco's doing</font>

185
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,590
there's other vendors that are looking

186
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it too which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what if you had</font>

187
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,830
templates coming from flow that can give

188
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,629
you network or application layer

189
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,699
performance information how would you

190
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:32,430
float tool store that so something

191
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,500
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about so the</font>

192
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,659
classic flow use cases are mostly around

193
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,259
traffic engineering a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS</font>

194
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,699
attacks sometimes revenue who should I

196
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:48,689
to it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at congestion who should</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the politics the the network</font>

200
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,349
engineering driven by politics and

201
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:02,150
revenue you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some visibility with</font>

202
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:05,069
flow trending planning and forecasting

203
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,318
again there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even some security use</font>

204
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,669
cases of it not<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably as popular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

205
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,629
the now nod crowd that used in the

206
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:15,479
enterprise modeling how should i adjust

207
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,069
the network and then even customer cost

208
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,080
analysis if you can take communities

209
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,539
suddenly you can look at a packet model

210
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,909
costs on your network and look at

211
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:26,610
profitability analysis from customers so

212
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,860
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover these in great detail</font>

213
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,469
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to give you an idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

214
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,820
take flow and again you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

215
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,010
if you've never used<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow done</font>

216
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,899
processing it's looking behind the SNMP

217
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,458
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something is full but</font>

218
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,469
why is it full where's the traffic going

219
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,559
to and coming from looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by</font>

220
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,860
source network or interface to interface

221
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,060
again in a data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a backbone</font>

222
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,060
really many different slices of the

223
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can look at for those</font>

224
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,449
looking at you may pick a network and

225
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,540
say what interface is it coming in on

226
00:08:54,449 --> 00:09:00,510
what have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp paths been to for that</font>

227
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,760
so very<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep operational tool and even</font>

228
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,459
some business applications of this kind

229
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,500
of data

230
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:10,018
looking by a s path seeing a s path

231
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,329
change over time on a router on a

232
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,550
customer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer comes to you and</font>

233
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:16,199
says hey I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade my 10 gig you</font>

234
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">can at least get an idea of where</font>

235
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,339
they're sending traffic to how much it

236
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,140
costs you again it might instead of a s

237
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,200
path it might be communities that you

238
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,269
might pull that report on<font color="#E5E5E5"> d das</font>

239
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,750
detection very common to be looking at

240
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:33,899
flow s flow again better because with

241
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:37,500
net flow the router will be trunking for

242
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,079
10 to 60 seconds typically and a lot of

243
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers are looking to get detected</font>

244
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:45,300
pretty quickly we've all probably been

245
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,670
in the case where<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer you know in</font>

246
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,959
the provider world it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even as much</font>

247
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,060
the customer being attacked but all

248
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,560
their neighbors so a lot of providers

249
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to be in the position of knowing</font>

250
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,949
before customers called a knock that

251
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:57,450
there's an issue in a pop and again s

252
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,230
flow can give you that his<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability a</font>

253
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:04,649
little bit better a little bit faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

we've been struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> with getting non</font>

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,699
can be carried over IP fix and net flow

v9 templates they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are flow but</font>

272
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:51,660
the kinds of analytics you're doing with

273
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:54,240
it instead of grouping by geography or

00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:37,149

how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the network and you</font>

293
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,649
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take some of those sources</font>

294
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,420
of data and put them into flow tools and

295
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:49,689
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about that so</font>

296
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,389
what kind of data would you like to get

297
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:54,810
well you know the baseline I always come

298
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:58,569
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is how is the network performing</font>

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:09,040
struggling with for a long time so sort

304
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:11,529
of think of it as semantics which is

305
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,449
what is the traffic more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just port</font>

316
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,689
then you can aggregate it the same way

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're used to thinking about</font>

usually those things run on taps where

there's high value traffic or for

357
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:30,529
vendors are looking at maybe doing some

00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:34,759
of this augmented flow some of the

359
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:36,350
issues with them are that right now some

360
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,139
of those vendors only export unsampled

361
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,639
flow so that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very stressful for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

everything and can't do rate limiting to

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,889
many people run bro suricata snorts

somewhere in their enterprise for

368
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:01,549
customers so those are already looking

369
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:05,179
at packets and grabbing IP addresses

373
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:13,610
semantics so if you already have parts

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the network that are instrumented you</font>

375
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:19,129
can get visibility by taking that data

00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:21,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and making it look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like flow web servers</font>

377
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:24,410
so we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a lot working with CD</font>

378
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,319
ends web companies imagine you've got a

server<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to monitor flow on</font>

380
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:31,368
well you could start looking at things

381
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:33,108
like retransmits by running in provo

382
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:35,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Argus but that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at the pcap</font>

383
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:37,939
all the way up to reconstruct what the

384
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,379
state was but if you have a web server

385
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:40,699
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can reach into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

390
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:55,040
running as a proxy you've got basically

391
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,510
all the flow data plus a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll show you from engine X</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Citrix does export a-10s working on this</font>

395
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,979
so different vendors can generate flow

396
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,240
that's got some of these templates in it

397
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,640
that let you look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> performance</font>

398
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,880
layer and cisco has a big push with the

399
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,400
AVC which actually could run on a srs

400
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,830
and you can grab traffic and say now I

401
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,260
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to instrument this and generate</font>

420
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,680
a lot of tools do let you say here are

<font color="#E5E5E5">some templates and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll show you what</font>

that looks like in some configs and now

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,640
take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the tool call it this and</font>

you some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the templates they've got</font>

432
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,280
round trip<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you know these are</font>

433
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:44,540
additional templates that would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

434
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:49,550
top of the normal flow record they'll

435
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:51,539
often have<font color="#CCCCCC"> QSR tags jitter various</font>

436
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,090
counters that you can set

437
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:55,259
and so you'll get the normal flow and

438
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,549
you'll get these templates so normally

439
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,529
what would happen is the device could be

440
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:59,970
exporting these and the flow tool won't

441
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,739
know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to map it so it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just drop it</font>

442
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,139
so actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually it won't cause any</font>

443
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:06,119
harm to configure this but to actually

444
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:07,469
take these and map them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something as</font>

445
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,840
something you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at in the</font>

446
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,119
specific flow tool and so imagine you've

447
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,340
got a backbone running how many people

448
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:22,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">use a srs for data center gateway for</font>

449
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:24,238
backbone customer aggregation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

450
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:26,039
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a srs and you configure this</font>

451
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:27,419
and of course the big wild card with any

452
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,070
new feature and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't crash your</font>

453
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,379
network or your device or whatever right

454
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,989
so then you could actually potentially

455
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:35,609
be getting live instrumentation rather

456
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:38,099
than just pinging or in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

457
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:41,149
bricks type setup you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

458
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:43,439
what the router thinks the performances

459
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:46,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">Citrix if you've ever used a netscaler</font>

460
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,409
has something called app flow again some

461
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:54,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">URLs in the presentation and have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT</font>

462
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:58,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">and HTTP data that you can get from it n</font>

463
00:18:54,599 --> 00:19:02,059
top which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a again a has n probe has</font>

464
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,499
templates and you can see they've got

465
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:07,229
enterprise they've basically got<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

466
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:08,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">known in IP fix they've gotten an ID for</font>

467
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:12,210
n top and then different identifiers

468
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:15,720
that you can grab for what retransmitted

469
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:18,929
packets is geography application latency

470
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,190
and again map that into your system and

471
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,739
now you can do some interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

472
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">so for example n probe can be used on a</font>

473
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:29,359
server watching pcap on a hypervisor

474
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:34,769
attached to bridges or again on a sensor

475
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:36,539
cisco has a product or a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

476
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:38,099
open source called open sock where

477
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,799
they've actually integrated into in

478
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,869
probe with the HTTP decoder and it's

479
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,629
free so<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally is a commercial license</font>

480
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:48,478
but it's a big data stack but it also

481
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:50,299
has n probe so again if you tap span put

482
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:55,789
it on you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of that data</font>

483
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:57,629
engine X logs bro logs there's

484
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:00,450
configurable that you can do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

485
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:03,178
engine X tuning to actually export<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

486
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">round-trip time and congestion windows</font>

487
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,090
and again if you can

488
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,520
map that into flow now you've got more

489
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:13,600
instrumentation about the actual health

490
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,570
or performance of the network so how do

491
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,100
you store this the data back end needs

492
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,230
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand it and build</font>

493
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">some mapping by default you're not going</font>

494
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,710
to hurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything generally turning</font>

495
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,160
things on<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow tools will just drop</font>

496
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,680
templates they don't understand but you

497
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,240
do need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a little mapping often</font>

498
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,850
people will put this into the back end

499
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,010
do some back-end CLI or API scripting

500
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,360
then work on getting it into the portal

501
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,040
once they establish<font color="#CCCCCC"> these interesting</font>

502
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,060
use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are interesting for</font>

503
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,320
debugging or detecting issues and you

504
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,590
know what we see working with people

505
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,260
again less on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider side but more</font>

506
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,290
on the one the web enterprise is the

507
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">holy grail is what's the application</font>

508
00:20:53,290 --> 00:21:00,250
performance is there something that's

509
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:01,770
affecting you and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> so where is it what</font>

510
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:06,130
is the cause between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network layer</font>

513
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,860

<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe even with instrumentation and New</font>

515
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,770
Relic type thing and we've seen a lot of

516
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,780
your customers that actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">very constructive and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them have</font>

rum they've got better data than we do

519
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,169
as operators about JavaScript

520
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:30,120
instrumentation of what the performance

521
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:32,800
is from here there but the tools to date

522
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,389
haven't really helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that</font>

523
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">run the websites to see what the network</font>

524
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,070
is doing and so a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this comes down</font>

525
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,139
to not only monitoring but also just

526
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,939
reducing time when there's a user

527
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,920
problem and people have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point say is</font>

528
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,900
it a network issue so that's where we

529
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,940
see things going we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> even seen some</font>

530
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,620
providers that are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get data from</font>

531
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,810
their customers that can do this

532
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,489
instrumentation but of course then the

533
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,899
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the promises that you'll be a</font>

534
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,150
little bit responsive to that which is

535
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">always dangerous because explaining the</font>

536

538
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,500
tricky so one back-end storage system

539
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,750
I'll point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to which actually there's a</font>

flow tool code is anyone using IP fix

call comes out of the checklist of

akhiyan Nick they did a and a fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit</font>

netflow tool there's a fast fit is an

545
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:25,989
indexing library<font color="#CCCCCC"> luca 4n probe had used</font>

546

this a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years back which is where we</font>

547
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:30,489
had seen it and he's got CLI and some

548
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:33,039
tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use that actually</font>

549
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:35,950
wind up turning the flow storage into

550
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,809
sequel queria bowl or in some of these

551
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,450
tools sequel like variability so you can

552
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,369
be very flexible slice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dice and it's</font>

553
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,349
a column store format that lets you

554
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:45,849
store the attributes in just separate

555
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:48,820
columns and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a sequel</font>

556
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:51,549
mapping<font color="#E5E5E5"> upfront so very easy to expand</font>

557
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,619
you'll have IP v4 address ipv6 address

558
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:55,658
geography but if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> map a</font>

559
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:57,399
template and create app latency then

560
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:59,109
that becomes something you can you can

561
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:00,998
query and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other tools</font>

your own in big data platforms it's

00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,720
generally even easier you'll need to if

00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:32,529
measure that tcp be transmitted which is

576
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:38,619
a what a lot of the web operators look

577
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:40,269
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT and add that to your flow</font>

578
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:42,070
reporting so that you can do the same

579
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:44,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of slicing and dicing that we</font>

580
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,439
talked about before but organized by

581
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:50,049
percent retransmit one thing I'll say is

582
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,289
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're doing retransmits</font>

583
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:54,729
packet loss you don't necessarily want

584
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:56,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to have a little bit of waiting</font>

585
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:59,139
because you may have a really long

586
00:23:56,349 --> 00:24:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">session that had as an absolute number</font>

587
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:04,389
the most retransmits especially as TCP

588
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,489
is ramping you'll have things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

589
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:08,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">like retransmits and you really won't do</font>

590
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:12,249
want to wait when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do this kind of</font>

reporting in systems based on fast bit

00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:15,909
if you're already building sequel

593
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:19,119
queries you just add a column and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

594
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:22,019
you do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just change the query a</font>

595
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:25,749
little bit and before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we looked at</font>

596
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:27,309
traffic by destination is instead if

597
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:29,499
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the data in a tool you can</font>

598
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:30,370
look at percent we transmitted by

00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:33,940
destination

600
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,620
or a common one is second hop a s so not

601
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,700
necessarily my transit provider but the

602
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:42,399
one right beyond or the entire AF path

603
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,809
so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do a and I'll go</font>

data to drive that well rather than

609

looking at the user behavior to see what

problem but if there is try to do some

correlation and show me where to look

640
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,030
and again if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the data in there</font>

641
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,649
you can start building the queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example API performance debugging</font>

00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:11,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">blast bought detection and you've heard</font>

on some of the same data

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,610
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be putting out some</font>

661
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,700
tools on our github that actually let

662
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,409
you take web logs bro logs some of these

663
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,710
other augmented sources will break down

664
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:03,020
the break down those templates so we're

665
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the homework and turn it into a</font>

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,129
flow export type that we're creating

667
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,110
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> K flow which how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next movie 5 specification</font>

669
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,540
ever just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> see struct so think of a</font>

670
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,580
modern see struct something called

671
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,710
captain proto ever heard of proto buffs

672
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,050
anybody so it's the the guy that did

673
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:26,340
protobuf said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want something really</font>

674
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:28,940
fast so created captain proto and it's

675
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:33,360
just a way to serialize or put into a

676
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:35,640
transport format different different

677
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,889
protocols and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it's a</font>

678
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,720
superset<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all of these augments that</font>

679
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,070
map in and then we're going to have some

680
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,050
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can take some of this</font>

681
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,590
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then put it into this format</font>

682
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,840
and put it out into IP fix v9 and put it

683
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,179
into your standard flow tools and so

684
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,090
what it looks like it's there's go

685
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:56,550
binding see bind<font color="#E5E5E5"> c++ bindings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pro</font>

686
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:59,879
bindings and then it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

687
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,860
write code around it so I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

688
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,450
in 30 minutes with 32 slides I just

689
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,429
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tease you a little bit getting</font>

690
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,580
thinking about talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vendors about</font>

691
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:11,010
this we've talked to some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other vendors</font>

692
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,050
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have said yeah we're</font>

693
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,940
sort of hearing buzz there's things we

694
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,590
could do on the a sex would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

695
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,570
interesting but we don't hear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

696
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,879
community saying oh yeah we loved their

697
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,550
performance information implementation

698
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,490
at the flow layer so I would encourage

699
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:27,750
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your vendors about it and</font>

700
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:36,110
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have two minutes for</font>

701
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:36,110
questions flames or comments mr. Dobbins

702
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay got it right I can project or is it</font>

703
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,120
working out okay great yeah great

704
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation lots of good information</font>

705
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,219
just wanted to clarify a couple of

706
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,930
points the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute thing about</font>

707
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,270
floatzel<font color="#CCCCCC"> in treas is implemented in</font>

708
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,280
those platforms is actually a myth the

709
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,860
speed of detection classification<font color="#E5E5E5"> traced</font>

710
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,899
back via flow telemetry is actually

711
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:08,090
affected by combination of the active

712
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,070
flow timer setting the inactive flow

713
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,699
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're sitting as well as the actual</font>

714
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:15,800
state size and state of the flow cash

715
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,990
and to give an exporter there's a high

716
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,740
degree of variability there the one

717
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,780
minute thing is people talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,860
that an operator would set for the

720
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,680
active flow timer would be a 60 seconds

721
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,080
that's actually a maximal value not a

722
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,370
minimal value so the active flow timer

723

is the ultimate arbitrator<font color="#E5E5E5"> are of the</font>

brought attention to one of the problems

has been until very recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> while you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sis is first of all a cisco</font>

flexible net flow which you can blame me

733

for the CLI for that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

worked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when i was at cisco the</font>

735
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,379
problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a lot of</font>

736
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">different additional fields that could</font>

737
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,900
be exported but the vendors didn't

738
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:14,720
provide a<font color="#E5E5E5"> standardized control plane</font>

interface for dynamically building and

these different<font color="#CCCCCC"> nokian on key fields and</font>

finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually providing some</font>

744

standardized interfaces for that and so

745
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open source tool</font>

746
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,870
vendors as well as commercial tool

747
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,969
vendors will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finally start</font>

748
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,530
taking advantage of some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these richer</font>

749
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,500
flow formats that you did a great job of

750
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,450
explaining you know quite some time

751
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,120
after they've been introduced but better

752
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:48,350
late than<font color="#CCCCCC"> never thank you we are in</font>

753
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:51,379
violent agreement I've said we're in

agreement we weep yeah at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

755
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,260
we'll probably do a fluid tutorial and

756
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,090
get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

757
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,790
inner ickiness of configuring all the

758
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,949
flow timers but and probably have a

<font color="#E5E5E5">subsection on how to make your 3b</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XL's</font>
