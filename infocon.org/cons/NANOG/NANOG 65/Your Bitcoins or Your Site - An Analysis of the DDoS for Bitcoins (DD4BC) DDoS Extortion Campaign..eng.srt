00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,759
with us basically since the days of the

the early days of IRC and bitnet

people's bitcoins and things of that

66
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,768
nature and we've also seen a lot of ddos

activity around<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin for example</font>

68
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:14,099
we've seen attempts to manipulate the

value of Bitcoin where we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

actors who are launching<font color="#CCCCCC"> geass attacks</font>

against Bitcoin mining farms and

exchanges and things of that nature one

73
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,399
of the most important things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

74
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,440
understand about bitcoin is that this

audience you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably know what bitcoin</font>

76
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,940
is raise your hands you know what

77
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,069
bitcoin is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right so if you go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

79
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,600
haven't heard of Bitcoin or they vaguely

80
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,310
heard of it but they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,840
what it is so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic internet money</font>

82
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,819
as far as they're concerned um why would

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,459
an attacker want to use Bitcoin to

84
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,920
receive extortion payouts well it's an

85
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,989
international you know fiat currency

86
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,030
right so you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and move it</font>

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">around anywhere on the global internet</font>

it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for at least pseudo</font>

can longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin you can run it</font>

91
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,370
through several<font color="#CCCCCC"> different transactions</font>

92

very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rapidly to try and launder it</font>

93
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,370
very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cash until recently</font>

94
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin had a very high exchange rate</font>

95
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,039
when compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> most other fiat</font>

96
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,950
currencies and it's completely set apart

97
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:28,260
from governments and regulatory entities

98
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,889
which means that is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to avoid</font>

99
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,860
paying tax on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin transactions and</font>

100
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:38,940
the pool of bitcoins can be expanded to

101
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,810
an ultimate finite limit what is the

102
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,600
disadvantage to an attacker

103
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,810
using Bitcoin well it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

untraceable cash is not untraceable cash

106
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,950
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> are fit i'm assuming these days</font>

107
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,950
everything else so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to</font>

108
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,560
trace cache there are also ways if

109
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:03,190
you're persistent to try to trace

110
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,700
bitcoin payouts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the flow of</font>

111

currency through the Bitcoin system it's

112
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,889
actually potentially easier to trace

113
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">bitcoin then cash because you're not</font>

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,600
dealing with physicality here you can

115
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,240
automate<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of it it's easier in many</font>

123
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,330
more volatile than other currencies that

124
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,620

125
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,700
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that unlike us right this</font>

most ordinary people have either never

heard of Bitcoin or if they've heard of

129

back in the early the Bitcoin ecosystem

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,419
can be viewed by many in the mainstream

160
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,680
it's kind of a fringe sort of thing it's

<font color="#CCCCCC">not really viewed as being in the</font>

attacked a few very large financial

258

after mid tier or regional financial

260
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:05,080
for this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D for VC is calculated</font>

261
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,110
that these organizations are less likely

00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,320
to have the technical skills and the

263

264
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,950
serious DDoS attacks and so they are

265
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:20,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">more likely in DD for bc's estimation to</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to pay an extortion payout</font>

267
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:28,899

ratio<font color="#CCCCCC"> between extortion threats that</font>

271
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:40,839
ratio that ratio has gotten much lower

272
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,270
since DD for BC has expanded its

send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out more extortion demands and they</font>

275
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:51,819
launch attacks but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> much lower</font>

gross overkill it's like trying to swat

322
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,769
a fly with a nuclear weapon and so we've

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,620
the targets did at least initially

326
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:07,959
suffer some some some downtime but tens

00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,849
they'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they will send an email</font>

they provide enough information so that

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,760
the recipient has a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea</font>

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:45,570
and target someone someone else we have

381
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:48,780
seen them come back to target the same

organizations from time to time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

383
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,290

organizations that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> little or no</font>

availability loss

389
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:04,470
and these attacks because they are

390
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-prepared they've already been</font>

391
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,119
through this they know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and so</font>

00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:10,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">DD for BC gets frustrated and wants to</font>

394
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,480

395
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,539
going on there so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a typical DD</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for BCE extortion demand and you'll note</font>

00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:23,489
here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 4 BC are actually</font>

398
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:26,429
referencing their own press right you're

399
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:28,049
saying okay well we're DD<font color="#E5E5E5"> for BC and you</font>

400
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:31,139
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard of us but if you haven't</font>

401
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:35,100
here's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of links and we want you</font>

402
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:37,799
to pay us and we're running attack right

403
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:41,279
now a demonstration attack against your

404
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,929
server will stop in an hour and so we

405
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,609
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to go and get some bitcoins and</font>

406
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,710
we know that you may not have some

407
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,809
bitcoins on hand or may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know</font>

408
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,690
what they are and so will give will

409
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,100
generously give you 48 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

410
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,429
bitcoins and you don't even have to

411
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,259
reply this message just send the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin</font>

412
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,119
extortion payment to this particular

413
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,009
Bitcoin address and we'll know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

414
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:07,799
paid and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't hear from us again</font>

415
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:09,359
and so here is a follow-on extortion to

416
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:12,179
me and so they initially made an initial

417
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:15,869
demand this organization did not give in

418
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:18,480
and so they attack some more and they

419
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">said you've got six hours or we're going</font>

420
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start the attack again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and went to up</font>

421
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:26,879
the demanded pay up and this is one

422
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,919
where the attacker was frustrated

423
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:31,559
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said well I see that you</font>

426

keep doubling it every day of the attack

432
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:52,889
until you finally pass in terms of the

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,320
actual DDoS attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DD for BC</font>

435
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,928
with a mixture of ntp and ssdp

00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,509
reflection amplifications sometimes some

437
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:06,779
dns reflection amplification and send

438
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:09,299
flooding and so after TV for pc games

439
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:12,919
them operational experience they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lead with ssdp or ntp</font>

441
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,220
sometimes we'll go

442
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,770
to syn floods or another methodology as

443
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:24,330
well they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very very focused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

444
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,850
monitoring the efficacy of their attack

445
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,590
and if they see that the targeted

446
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,449
organization is successfully defending

447
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,060
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack they will shift</font>

448

449
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,710
defenses and then you know the second

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">vector they go to is mitigated and they</font>

451
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,090
will shift to a third vector they would

452
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,850
do them in combination so they're very

453
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:49,439
very focused on monitoring the efficacy

454
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:53,189
of the attack they always at least so

455
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,830
far have gone specifically after<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

456
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:59,130

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:02,280
any other type of server service or

460
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:12,449
don't attack in parallel they go after

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:15,389
one target at a time and they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

462
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,370
concentrate in one geography so like

this week at Switzerland's turned or

464
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:22,229
this week it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States turn or</font>

466
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:27,240
what they'll do is they will leap around

467
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,070
in terms of geography but they will do

468
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,110
they have a launch a spate of attacks

469
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,350
against organization space<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

470
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,780
particular geography and do them all

471
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:39,870
serially and then jump somewhere else

472
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:43,110
that's what we've observed so far the

473
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:46,729
the DD for<font color="#CCCCCC"> BC attackers are not using as</font>

475
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,570
new DDoS attack methodologies that are

476
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,060
radically new they're difficult to

of the booter and stressor operators

methodologies for example we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

505
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,309

capability to launch a wordpress<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML</font>

508
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,260
and shortly thereafter DD for<font color="#CCCCCC"> BC added</font>

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,830
that attack mythology methodology to

510
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:20,340
their repertoire so they are keeping up

511
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:23,879
with the publicly available tools and

512
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,918
adopting new attack methodologies ask

513
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,030
the Butera stressor service operators

514
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,760
add those to their services d 4 BC are

515
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,470
very disciplined they have a methodology

516
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,059
the methodology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just described to</font>

517
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,160
you with the initial attack and the

518
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,500
initial distortion demand the

519
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,660
escalations for non-communication the

520
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,540
installations for attempted defense

521
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,690
these are all standard and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see</font>

522
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:51,510
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of variation in those</font>

523
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,510
behaviors so DD for<font color="#CCCCCC"> BC have kind of a</font>

524
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:57,350
cookie cutter<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach and again they</font>

525
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:00,929
will react to successful the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense</font>

526
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,639
within the repertoire that they have

527
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:04,679
they will start<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with one methodology</font>

528
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,299
if that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work they'll switch to</font>

529
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,130
another methodology they'll switch to a

530
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,710
third methodology then they'll try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

531
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:14,700
once three at once for it once never<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

532
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:16,020
really radical shifts and these are how

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> booter stressor service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

539
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:34,110

almost too strong a word<font color="#E5E5E5"> a variation I</font>

541
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:40,010
guess you would say of an attack

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,580
methodology in DD for bc's repertoire so

543

ssdp

544
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:48,480

545
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:50,459
actually making use of a feature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> upnp</font>

547
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:57,030
implemented unfortunately on a lot of

and in some cases on host directly as

551
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,040
well and so the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a normal</font>

all of these CPE devices that have ssdp

running on their internet connected

562

and pummel them with all these

unsolicited in search responses that's

565
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,690
how a typical ssdp reflection

566
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,440
amplification attack works what we've

seen be four bc do in some circumstances

of a little bit different we've seen

when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't work they'll switch</font>

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:32,190
are sitting behind those CPE devices

580
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,179
which have registered with ephemeral

582
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:44,040
interface of the CPE device and they're

583
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:47,070
sending HTTP / you get requests to those

584
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,409
ports that show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up as having a upnp</font>

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:56,780
doing this is that by definition all<font color="#CCCCCC"> unp</font>

587
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,930
pnp compliant devices that register

themselves with a upnp control point

589
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:08,090
like a home router they have a very

590
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">brief HTML Status page that lists some</font>

593
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,840
that's sitting inside the home like a

594
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,720
game console like some embedded linux

595

device that's a media player things of

596
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,820

601

launch the attacks to send a spoof HTTP

/ you get to the ephemeral port that on

these various cpe devices millions of

00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:10,129
always matted and they pummel the target

611
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:12,800
the attack profile looks a little bit

612
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:15,320
different because instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as with a</font>

normal ssdp reflection amplification

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:27,170
UDP 1900 on the cpe devices they're

617
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,990
useless reflectors amplifiers it's

618
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:33,760
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from some pseudo random ephemeral</font>

400-500 bytes in size the attacker does

621
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,190
yield multiple packets for a single

622
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,650

around eight to one ten to one something

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,960
in that nature so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal ssdp</font>

like we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have our initiator over there on</font>

635
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:27,470
see the attackers uses UDP 80 does

<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody know why the reason is that a</font>

637
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,990
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of non-specialists don't really know</font>

638

the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between tcp and UDP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

639
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,000
or if they have an instrumentation at

640
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:42,678
all all they see is poor dating so it's

641
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,389
kind of a form of obfuscation and so the

642
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:50,269
the attacker will source the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EM search</font>

643
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:53,479
requests from the IP address the spoofed

00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:56,120
IP address this is why bcp 84 is so

645
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,580
important he will spoof the IP address

646
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,789
of the victim say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:13,759
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them are home Soho cpe devices</font>

651
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,730
some of them are windows boxes that have

652
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,860
a upnp toolkit enabled and things like

653
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,110
that the request is about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

654
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:24,258
nineteen bytes in size so the request

655
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:27,459
goes out and so what happens is all of

656
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:30,620
these ssdp reflectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> amp and amplifiers</font>

657
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,730
dutifully respond to the victim with

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:38,268
these unsolicited SSD p.m. search

reflectors amplifiers to the port that

661
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:46,490

typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic stream distinct</font>

666
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,389

667
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:02,529

non initial fragments which of course

671
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:13,070
don't have source and destination ports

672
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:15,529
and the important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to note about</font>

673
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:19,250
any reflection and amplification attack

about works a little bit differently you

about this one does circling rad its rad

752
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,820
amor right it's a rattle IP address so

753
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not an RFC 1918 address this is</font>

767
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,770
what's different about this IP address

768
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,650
set right self assign that's right so

769
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:37,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a device that try to get you a</font>

thats related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

774
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,859
this protection system right and we see

775
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,570
here sure enough if we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upnp</font>

776
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:55,150
registration information we see that

777
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,340
this is apparently a Wi-Fi access point

778
00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:01,240
that's sitting behind some kind of home

779

router so who is DD for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC what a CD for</font>

781
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,440
extortion emails that we've seen we

782
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,350
believe that the DBC is relatively

783
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,960
fluent in English but it's not a native

784

sending out and financial organization a

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,009
bunch of extortion demands and was very

789
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,300
upset we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a response and so</font>

790
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,340
started launching you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack the</font>

culture DD for BC is cereal in nature

802
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,850
not in parallel attacks a single target

803
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:00,310
at a time this plus some other factors

804
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,069
leads one to the conclusion that DD for

805
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,690
BC may well be an individual this is my

806
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,630
personal theory i think is probably a

807
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:11,170
single person<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um DD for</font>

811
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,680
is and uses them somewhat effectively

812
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:24,400
but it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> innovator we</font>

813
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:28,149
don't see exotic attacks from BB 4 BC

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are difficult to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mitigate and we</font>

815
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:35,260
also see that 84 bc maybe a little bit

816
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:38,319
naive because one of the worst kinds of

817
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:40,990
targets you can go again up against if

818
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,390
you're trying to stay free and avoid law

819
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:45,160
enforcement involvement is financial

820
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:48,670
institutions and that that is right

821
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:53,170
where DD for<font color="#E5E5E5"> bc has expanded so not very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">smart in that regard basically VV for bc</font>

00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:38,690
microphone number two again Matt<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTAC</font>

1010
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:41,360
yahoo so you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've got</font>

1011
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,060
this upnp vector where they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1012
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,730
enumerate capture the response and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1013
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,560
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the sources behind it this</font>

1014
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,930
would imply that instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it being a</font>

1015
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,880
spoofed source at some point the command

1016
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:56,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control system is actually using a</font>

1017
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,810
real reachable node to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N search</font>

1018
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,339
enumerate and capture those responses do

1019
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:04,370
you know if people are doing honey pots

1020
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:06,170
to look for non spooked sources right so

1021
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:09,980
that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> insightful question so so</font>

1022
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:11,900
the questioners point is that whoever is

1023
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,360
launching reflector reflection

1024
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,580
application attack has to go through an

1025
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,830
enumeration stage to discover and

1026
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,450
enumerate these various types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1027
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,330
reflectors amplifiers out here on the

1028
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:26,180
internet and the question is is anyone

1029
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:28,819
looking at the skins to see if they tend

1030
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,279
to triangulate somewhere the problem

1031
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:34,340
with the internet is<font color="#E5E5E5"> background</font>

1032
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,440

1033
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,500

1037

you're a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher everybody</font>

1040
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,410
and the attackers are scanning in many

<font color="#E5E5E5">cases from there also get there's</font>

1043
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:02,190
many cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're scanning from systems</font>

1044
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:04,680
that have different IP addresses from

1045
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:06,750
the botnets or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> booter stress or</font>

1046
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,190
services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're actually using to</font>

1047
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,830
launch the attacks from and so they

1048
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:15,000
engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that kind of offset another</font>

1049
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:16,830
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they do is they identify IP</font>

1050
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,990
blocks that are not masqueraded very

1051
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:21,660
well that obviously are part of security

1052
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:25,439
research organizations and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1053
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:28,350
allow those you know to scan them that

1054
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,910
they do a lot of obfuscation and so

1055
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why it's a good question but</font>

1056
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,950
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so much noise that's very</font>

1057
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:38,940
difficult but thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> micro number one</font>

1058
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:40,230
Phil Rosenthal from is prime so about

1059
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,570
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> booter and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stress through</font>

1060
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:44,010
services you know you said they they

1061
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertised it as like oh this is a</font>

1062
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:48,930
stress test and I mean real ously

1063
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,880
speaking people here may actually choose

1064
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:53,690
to buy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a stress test from them</font>

1065
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:58,050
I'm sure that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primary business</font>

1066
00:47:53,690 --> 00:48:00,150
but that said if they were a<font color="#CCCCCC"> legitimate</font>

1067
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:02,340
business selling the service they would

1068
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,330
be buying transit and actually launching

1069
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,400
it from their own networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they're</font>

1070
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:07,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">not doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are bouncing it off</font>

1071
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,780
of things on the public internet that

1072
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:12,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">therefore it is trespassing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's theft</font>

1073
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,190
of services why doesn't law enforcement

1074
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,680
look at it that way what you and I and

1075
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone else in this room knows versus</font>

1076
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,990
what lawmakers and regulators and law

1077
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,270
enforcement agencies in different

1078
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,740
jurisdictions around the world now are

1079
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:29,310
sometimes very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things</font>

1080
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:32,220
right and to your point the nature of a

1081
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:34,740
reflection amplification<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack tends to</font>

1082
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,230
militate against the excuse that this is

1083
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,939
just a traffic generator this used for

1084
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate stress testing right and</font>

1085
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:44,910
you're absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> right unfortunately</font>

1086
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,770
the law hasn't caught up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's so</font>

1087
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,870
many jurisdictions worldwide there are

1088
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:51,270
jurisdictions where the rule of law does

1089
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:53,339
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold sway and by the way that's</font>

1090
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:56,880
where most of the SS the pot the current

1091
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,800
floating population of ssdp reflective

1092
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,150
amplifiers lives is in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

1093
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,460
jurisdictions where the rule of law

1094
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,430
doesn't tend to hold sway and so that's

1095
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,079
part of the prob

1096
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:10,990
as well if you look at human history

1097
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:13,329
crime has always been with us ok we have

1098
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,759
skulls right from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police to Sierra</font>

1099
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:18,880
you know in 60 50 60 thousand years ago

1100
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,369
of human predecessors that were

1101
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,930
obviously murdered because we can tell

1102
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:25,119
you know forensically look at the holes

1103
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,520
and their skulls that they were attacked

1104
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,710
with a blunt or sharp instrument crime

1105
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,819
is part of the human condition the

1106
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is part of the human condition</font>

1107
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:34,869
therefore crime is part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

1108
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:39,099
condition right it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1109
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:41,859
an issue the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that folks</font>

1110
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:44,410
can do of course is to implement anti

1111
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:47,759
spoofing ingress policing at their edges

1112
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:50,348
for anti spoofing<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCT 84 we also</font>

1113
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,859
strongly strongly urge broadband

1114
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:55,720
operators to proactively scan your

which are reflectors amplifiers and

1118
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,480
encourage your customers to remediate

1119
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:12,160
those devices or and fire those

1120
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:15,430
customers if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to great any other</font>
