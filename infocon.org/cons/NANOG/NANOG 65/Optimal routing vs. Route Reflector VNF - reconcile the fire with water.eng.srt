1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,530
all right next up we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> raffle</font>

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,240
tee hee

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:25,979
water good morning everybody it's nice

6
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:29,539
to be here it's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn a knock and feel</font>

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,619
at home yeah still good<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning</font>

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,220
especially for those from west coast

9
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:41,160
it's a time to start work so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:44,970
I would talk today on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> session about</font>

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,760
some implication of and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of use the</font>

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,570
virtual refractor especially in the

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:56,159
context of the routing optimality so we

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,220
start with as like a definition why we

15
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,510
are doing vnf why we are virtualized

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,299
network function which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,679
reflection function what are the

18
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:11,549
benefits we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after and then</font>

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,470
we examine the challenges with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the route</font>

20
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,960
reflector implementation in the

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,490
traditional environment and how we

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,259
address it today typically and then try

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to correct and seal these two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

24
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:31,640
see how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hui hui achieve the current</font>

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,590
optimality or current behavior while

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:40,799
benefiting from the death of virtual

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:43,829
function virtualization so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

28
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,420
reflection is a function right we tend

29
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,089
to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> route reflector as a</font>

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,799
device as a note but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,729
day it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> functionally needed in the</font>

32
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,350
network that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can instantiate it as a</font>

33
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,158
virtual instance as a software running

34
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,639
in visual environment and the natural

35
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,850
place for the virtual machine is a data

36
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:08,669
center and data center is where it is

37
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,318
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not where we want to be to have a</font>

38
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,119
data center from the route reflector

39
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,319
perspective it's where is it where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,480
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to believe with that and</font>

41
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,000
that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important point for my</font>

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,590
stock because this is what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will fight</font>

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,830
against the night at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time for</font>

44
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,620
why we visualize the

reflektor where we move it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

46
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:37,280
virtual environment we want to ensure

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it behaves in a way from the</font>

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,700
routing perspective in a way we expect

49
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,820
from with<font color="#CCCCCC"> reflectors so it selects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

51
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:50,450
and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have more problems</font>

52

with this session scale in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

53
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:57,470
scaling that's a second secondary order

54
00:02:52,490 --> 00:03:00,550
issue but just keep in mind very very

55
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,810
traditional approaches to use the router

56
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:08,600
whatever the rotaries use it use them to

57
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:13,370
make to run a route reflector on top of

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:17,510
the on top of this platform but the

59
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,070
point is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rooter by design is</font>

60
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,100
optimized to do packet forwarding

61
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,930
otherwise it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a Rooter not for the</font>

62
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">data storage for processing code that</font>

63
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,260
that overhead that's a cost of doing

64
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,790
business for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the for this kind of device</font>

65
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,489
however the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route reflection function is</font>

66
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,980
is critical is very important it takes a

67
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:40,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of resources but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> noted forwarding</font>

68

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:47,299
other end right we have which we have

70
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed for compute data and it will be</font>

71
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,660
good to use it because especially that

72
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:56,930
if we could consider efficiency like

73
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:00,799
cost of processing the prefix or cost of

74
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:03,920
keeping the rib it's much lower on the

75
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,739
x86 server platform and that's even

76
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,440
lower if we consider the<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual</font>

77
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:13,489
machines located in the data center

environment we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can easy eight and the vm</font>

79
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:19,250
so brings other<font color="#E5E5E5"> values as well we can</font>

80
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:26,289
easier scale it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up we can easier migrate</font>

81
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:29,080
from one to one<font color="#E5E5E5"> VM to another etc so</font>

82
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,729
because route reflector by his nature

83
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,340
it's a cost of doing business right

84
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paying all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your customer is</font>

85
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,049
paying for better or worse route

86
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,810
reflector you need it to run your

87
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,940
network but you need

88
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,620
efficient powerful but at the same time

89
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,410
the optimization point for route

90
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,380
reflector is always to find the cheapest

91
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,750
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we visual</font>

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you route reflectors works in the</font>

96
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:14,450
sorry for that works in the traditional

97
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,130
network right we take to the very very

98
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,280
traditional approach route reflector

99
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,889
function is a deported or running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on</font>

102
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:37,460
of the path and due to optimization path

103
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:41,300
optimization the slightly bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

104
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:44,599
try to distribute the reflection on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

105
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,380
original basis in order to promote

regional local exit regional local exit

107
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:55,510
from the network some again some

108
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,609
traditional approach is to use the

109
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">retired router which is not able to keep</font>

110
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:05,390
with the traffic we need to switch to

111
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,930
move them out of the data path and use

112
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,639
the master reflector platform but that's

113
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,100
it doesn't actually help smart because

114
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,120
it's all true<font color="#CCCCCC"> tirso it's already dated</font>

115
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:20,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">cpu limited memory that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that short</font>

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,880
short time optimization so the first

117
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,130
optimization for the route reflector

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,430
platform would be change the platform

119
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:31,550
right move from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rooter hardware</font>

123
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:47,210
absolutely possible especially nowadays

124
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,030
when all vendors provides the software

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,569
right it's a physical block from

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:19,610
somewhere in the network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to</font>

137

go there we have to upgrade it we have

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:28,849
to maintain it even worse this is this

139
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:31,039
requires new skills to manage the the

140
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:33,830

149
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,370
is shorter than in return it's good

150
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,590
because you always has the best of the

151
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,330
bread and faster platform but at the

152
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,210
same time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to manage upgrades</font>

153
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,318
and moving the moving this software from

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:20,419
one platform to another the other

of rotary rotary in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route reflection</font>

157
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:26,349
infrastructure is just centralized we

158
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:31,099
need the number of route reflectors and

159
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:34,189
that's not ideal in a new idea and in

160
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:36,679
context of virtual function or

161
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,279
virtualization<font color="#CCCCCC"> of route reflector it's a</font>

162
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,140
feeling right because hey let's move all

163
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,910
route reflectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the data center one</font>

164
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:49,399
or maybe two for redundancy but then

165
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:52,219
simple centralization to onenote exposed

166
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,790
some challenges it's quite possible to

167
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:58,970
do for VPNs and many provider are doing

168
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,730
this for VPN families but it's not that

169
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,940
popular for internet even in the past

170
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,190
and there are two fundamental issues

171
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,290
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very centralized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a single</font>

the

174

network it's a scaling challenge for

175
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,920
session and for path and we will examine

176
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,930
it in a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other even more</font>

177
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,680
important is suboptimal routing as

178
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:26,410
effect of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so first look closer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,970
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger capacity but it also has</font>

182
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,040
more and more loads so if we go extreme

183
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:41,470
and say how what hey one route reflector

184
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,819
will sell all my<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge shooters then we</font>

185
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,440
can end up with the thousands of

186
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,779
sessions and that's a pressure on memory

187
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,399
the big legal arrays but also on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu</font>

188
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,130
and on communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> path we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

193
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,390
in today's network especially in

194
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,020
internet route reflection infrastructure

195
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,490
is kind of distributed or regionalized

196
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,610
because it mitigates the problem they

197
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,520
compile you can look all you can see on

198
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,610
the on the right side that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of</font>

202
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:42,240
and there is no black magic here very

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:45,880
similar is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path scaling right the</font>

204
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,430
interesting observation is that from VPN

209
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:06,610
however in a internet context the big

224
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:46,510
and again the regularization of route

the hierarchy solves the problem it's

exactly the same math behind the debt

230
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:08,670
and end the session scaling and then

231
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:13,660
finally the routing optimality problem

232
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:16,930
the route reflector as a it falls<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp so</font>

if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the ad path aside we'll come</font>

free VPN sir l2vpn vpls this problem is

250
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,350
somehow somehow solved by use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pua</font>

251
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:13,660
of the bayous of route distinguisher

252
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:17,280
part of address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on based</font>

253
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:22,000
on the lib originator<font color="#E5E5E5"> loopback address</font>

254
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:24,130
this creates the unique prefix / unique

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,610
prefix from the route reflector point of

256
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:30,250
view and of course if every prefix is

257
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:34,150
unique there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to nothing to</font>

258
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:38,350
select every prefix is the best one

259
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:40,480
however for internet doesn't happen

260
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,840
there is no route distinguisher is that

261
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:48,460
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad path but a puff is not really</font>

268

269
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,300
have a again the scanning problem and

270
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:16,840
it's very it this killing grows very

fast with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route reflection and add</font>

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,030
birth Path would be the optimal from

276
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,700
from route reflector perspective from

277
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,670
the client perspective so again the

278
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,040
traditional answer to this problem is go

279
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,349
regional route reflectors that mitigates

the problem of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> route reflector</font>

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,640
a semi optimal but that's good enough

285
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,830
that's what we are doing today that's a

the visual environment indeed in the

296
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,390
located and there is an important

297
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,910
assumption I did during the preparation

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:13,840
of selection we have very important step

309
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,569
and this step is that the it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

which will do the our design and put

in our group at this picture you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

the problem of lack of layer free

354
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:36,330
connectivity to the route reflector and

355
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:41,259
we want to keep the we want to keep the

356
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:44,519
south region or north region to select

357
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:53,259
the local exit point in the region as a

358
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:56,919
big best bgp path so the proposal or the

359
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:58,690
approach to do that is yes we we have

360
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,899
the visual route reflector it runs the

361
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:06,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp as usual it has the same set of</font>

362
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:09,399
clients as the route reflector in before

363
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,990
scenario so the let's say south south

364
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,719
region clients are peering with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

use the south<font color="#E5E5E5"> as example when during</font>

375
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:51,189
this explanation because that's what the

376
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:54,070

387
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:31,290
right so we open the jury tunnel which

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:34,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">is which payload is terminated in these</font>

we will build the proper rib the at the

392
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,300
other end of the tunnel is somewhere

393
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,690
deep in the network in this example it's

394
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:56,409
a one of the core router in the south

395

region from video from<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP perspective</font>

396
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:02,620
there is a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of policies with ever</font>

397
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,660
we don't want the these shadow instance

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,560
to be a on the shortest path for

399
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:14,530

404
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,100
purpose of this instance is to have a

for the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we want to avoid</font>

417
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:18,700
the transit traffic entering this

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:20,709
distant last part is global instance of

419
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,320
the visual so the in the global things

420
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,980
as we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> vgp running and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

421

first of all the global instance is the

423
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,450
one which has the routing toward the

424
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,540

425
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,150
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what is the data center</font>

enough it could be defaulted to be

could happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this or other reason</font>

so it doesn't have another security

499
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,490
concerning these kind of things is hey I

500
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:39,230
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is no traffic</font>

502
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:45,020
the compute nodes are good for the bgp

503
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:50,230
but that's not the best quarter ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

504
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:54,680
would say the request ever so

we had at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time the shadow</font>

508
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:06,080
part of the network part of igp we have

509
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,720
to prevent the passing traffic through

510
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,760
so yes we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on the control</font>

511
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,760
line put the high metrics on them to

512
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:18,680
know set the overall bit if we can if it

513
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,360
is is that's good but that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> granted</font>

514
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,720
that their window there would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

515
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,570
traffic traffic so the warranty could be

516
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,790
achieved through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the filters and not and</font>

517
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:31,280
the filters applied on the shadow host

518
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,649
so are the ingress of the tunnel in the

519
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,480
network on the network side some event

520
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:39,860
or implementation may make it easier

521
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:42,410
than other but in generally that's

522
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:45,740
that's the general solution we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font>

523
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:49,940
filter which allows only only<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

524
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:53,960
traffic and maybe BFD and the concept

525
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:56,950
could be extended we may have no more

526
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">than one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shadow instance right if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

527
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:04,640
instruct bgp to use some a context trip

for our other contexts other instance

529
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,460
read to resolve the next up we can say

530
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:13,280
hey but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the rip one for the</font>

533
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,870
the next up resolution for the MV GP so

534
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:26,389
you are the RPF roots for the for

535
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,429
multicast why not and each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

536
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:31,760
instance may have different tune us

different point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a remote remote</font>

538
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,390
points of the two now and because of

539
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:41,060
that different topology view we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can even</font>

540
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:44,300
create different regions for the

internet different for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a VPN different</font>

542
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:53,740
for the multicast it's quite flexible so

543
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:56,389
in summary

544
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:59,050
instantiate route reflector as a virtual

545
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:02,260

00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:03,129
is the support of particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

582
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:06,010
the visual route reflector except bgp is

583
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:08,170
a is a vendor specific answer so i can

584
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:13,060
answer from my company but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's better</font>

585
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:14,890
do I offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um but usually you</font>

586
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,700
need the label that route if you want to

587
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:21,970
resolve labeled prefix bgp prefixes

588
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:25,230
again it's a vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> dependent or</font>

589
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">software the Bandit but there is nothing</font>

590
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:33,030
which stops you from the standard

591
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:35,409
perspective to punch to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> d put the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

592
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:39,580
prefixes you learn in the context into

593
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:41,890
the into the label a trip and tragedy

594
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,850
it's a fooling of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rooter factor</font>

595
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:48,400
right but you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did you not</font>

596
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,949
losing anything you still have the you

597
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,680
still the trace the reach ability of the

598
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:56,410
next stop exactly and for the

599
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,660
reachability validation and we can use

600
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">rip group and to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to work and so</font>

601
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,980
far it's a for the interior option C he

602
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:07,210
need to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other route reflector</font>

603
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,980
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass the label</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the coach who's</font>

604
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,680
the ESP are to go to the other side is a

605
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,810
label switch path and which required rdp

606
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,690
and the physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> are can do that and so</font>

607
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:18,460
far we are and the function is there but

608
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,530
I heard like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rdp it's going to be</font>

609
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,500
removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> from support from the we are and</font>
