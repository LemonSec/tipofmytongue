15
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:52,419
be a lot about data so let's get started

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,850
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be talking about forecasting</font>

17

<font color="#E5E5E5">the work i'm presenting here really was</font>

20
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,530
led by some fine folks at both the

00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,369
this what was the problem and where<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

25
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem come from the the underlying</font>

26
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:20,230
premise of this work was that reputation

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,810
matters your reputation on the internet

28
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:26,170
does matter and security posture of your

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,490
organization or somebody else's is or

30
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,220
should be an important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a</font>

business<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship ask this to just</font>

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,890
t-mobile and Experian last week when

33
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,149
they reported the the data breach

34
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,830
perhaps t-mobile could have made a

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,600
different choice with a vendor if they

36
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,760
had known the risk probability of

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,190
experience they had a choice of vendors

38
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,540
and they chose one and we had the data

39
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,950
to show that they could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a</font>

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,580
different choice of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike which might</font>

41
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,490
have had a better better result for them

42
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,590
finally the issue with with doing this

43
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,690
though is that security posture is is a

44
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,420
sum total of many many factors it

45
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,610
includes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> training it includes</font>

46
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,130
technology deploy how will you deploy as

47
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,080
well as processes what mechanisms do you

48
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,780
have in place to to manage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor</font>

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,370
and fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

50
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,799
measuring these things is really hard

51
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,959
and you need metrics to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

52
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:18,849
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can be structured and thoughtful</font>

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,580
about how you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it so it's not</font>

54

apples to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to oranges comparisons it's</font>

55
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:28,480
apples to apples repetitive over time so

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,290
that you have consistency so<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally you</font>

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,518
need and you need

58
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,959
to be able to do this at scale because

59
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,569
you need this information not just about

60
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,890
yourself needed about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all organizations</font>

61
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:40,780
that you might potentially deal with and

62
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,089
finally who has who has these kinds of

63
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,170
problems well for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the Department</font>

64
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,879
of Homeland Security which was the

65
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,920
initial funding behind this research

66
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,659
effort has this problem of being able to

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,280
assess critical infrastructure they

68
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:53,950
can't go on site they can't deploy

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,560
packet taps everywhere they have to have

70
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,238
some reports some independent way of

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,379
generating risk aggregation information

72
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,120
companies have need for this as well

73
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're talking about measuring</font>

75
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,730
relationships and they have a need for

76
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:12,669
this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand their own</font>

their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> security posture not just</font>

00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:16,329
their current status but how<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

79
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,030
making changes that are making<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

80
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,569
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> or worse over time and finally</font>

81
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the important one we see the cyber</font>

cyber security insurance marketplace

00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:28,870
stepping into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this area as well</font>

84
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,939
they're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write policies and</font>

85
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,280
they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to base those</font>

86
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:37,418
policies on actuarial information and

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,659
sound sound statistics and we all know

88
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,579
that 2014 breaches that were there were

89
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:45,608
top headlines including target home

90
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,379
depot JP<font color="#E5E5E5"> Morgan on and on and on and in</font>

91
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:50,010
some of the work that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

92
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:52,298
about those were actually case studies

93
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,448
so the one slight summary of what this

94
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk is really about is is this we use</font>

95
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:59,379
internet scale data measurements and

96
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:01,449
machine learning to do predictive cyber

97
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:03,328
security risk analysis of organizations

98
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,620
and the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> is useful for</font>

99
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,419
underwriters to set premiums for cyber

100
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,760
insurance there are several other things

101
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,169
you can do there as well several

102
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,939
innovations you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when it</font>

103
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes to doing cyber security insurance</font>

104
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,690
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is a little bit of a</font>

105
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,668
bit different beast than normal

106
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,668
insurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> policies that they're used to</font>

107
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:24,880
and finally network managers or

108
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:26,799
administrators can use this information

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,259
to measure the security posture of their

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,229
own enterprise and as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the risk</font>

111
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,880
of their partners so let's let's get

112
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:37,389
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nitty-gritty detail of how we</font>

113
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,150
do this so largely it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">data it starts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and ends with the data we</font>

what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we measure</font>

117
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,919
everything we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about measuring</font>

118
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,690
active risks we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

119
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,930
measuring late and risks as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font>

120
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,670
mismanagement indicators we do modeling

121
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,910
and feature extraction based on the data

122
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,830
data that we do collect we have to do

123
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,990
aggregation of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data up to an</font>

124
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,510
organization level that is it just by

125
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,860
itself a challenging task we have to

126
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,390
develop features what are we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

127
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,100
model what are the characteristics that

128
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,289
are potentially interesting that should

129
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,110
be fed into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the models and finally</font>

130
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,760
cleaning the data for the labels is an

131
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,440
extremely challenging task remember data

132
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,390
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to collect historical</font>

133
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,130
information as well and most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

134
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,800
reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> by organization not IP</font>

135
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,290
addresses so you sort of have to do this

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,750
manual process of matching breach

137
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,300
information into aggregation but more

138
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that in a little bit finally once</font>

139
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,140
you have clean your aggregate data

140
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,880
you've cleaned this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

141
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,710
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply standard machine learning</font>

142
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,469
techniques we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use a random forest</font>

144
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,540

145

scores based on on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> models and you</font>

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,600
the more interesting features that we

235
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,370
also look at are not just first order

236
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,920
statistics not just the raw counts or

237
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,930
ratios but also how these are changing

238
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,630
over time so we look at two to

<font color="#E5E5E5">three-month trending of this data and we</font>

240

frequency or duration of different

also fed into our models finally and

244
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,340
this actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the easier</font>

245

looking at the prediction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of events</font>

294
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,010
across all of our data breach sources

295
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,149
remember the fifty percent set that I

296
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,189
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use for</font>

297
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:58,510
our testing what we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at on the</font>

298
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">y-axis is a true positive percentage and</font>

299
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,350
on the on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-axis the false positive</font>

300
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,560
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at where those two</font>

301
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:09,070
horizontal dashed lines cross you will

302
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,479
see that's about the ninety percent mark

303
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,730
for true positive and the ten percent

304
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,920
mark for false positive what this means

305
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,269
is for the fifty percent of our data set

306
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,610
that we pretended we knew nothing about

307
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,769
our models were able to predict with a

308
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,230
ninety percent accuracy that those

309
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,480
incidents were for organizations that

310
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a high risk in other words their</font>

311
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,070
data indicated that those organizations

312
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,740
were doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were more likely</font>

313
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:38,470
to lead to breaches than not in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> features that we test for</font>

315
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,730
there was a clear differentiation

316
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,589
between the kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of features that were</font>

317
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,910
more important relatively more important

318
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:50,209
than others remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were measuring</font>

319
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,610
for a wide variety of characteristics

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,529
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it turned out our hunch that</font>

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">mismanagement features would be the most</font>

322
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:58,899
predictive was actually correct with

323
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:02,350
what you're looking at in this chart is

324

333

344
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,720

management features by themselves have

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:57,949
an extremely low true positive false

348
00:13:55,189 --> 00:14:00,559
positive ratio what works well is the

349
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:02,300
combination or the red line where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

350
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,759
look once again at the ninety percent

is once again displaying a true positive

00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:10,430
of about ninety percent in the false

354
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:12,138
positive of ten percent so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns</font>

355
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,290
out the most interesting result of the

356
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:16,939
study is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or two</font>

357
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,399
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure about an</font>

359
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,829
cybersecurity prediction model you need

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:26,089
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all of them and and the</font>

361
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:28,339
intuition behind this is actually very

362
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:31,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting so remember cybersecurity at</font>

363
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:33,709
an organization is not just a matter of

364
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:35,719
securing the routing path it's not a

365
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:38,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter of securing just the DNS servers</font>

366
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,470
it spans the whole organization so

367
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,709
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at securing everything</font>

368
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,540
from the web applications to the DNS

369
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:46,459
servers to the workstations to the

370
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,679
servers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the switches in the closet</font>

371
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:50,359
that people forgot oh and also there's a

polycom units in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conference</font>

373
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,129
room that need to be secured as well and

374
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:57,110
that is sort of the intuition intuitive

375
00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:00,110
understanding behind why you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

376
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,420
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect as diverse a set of data</font>

377
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,980
as you can about an organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:41,559
numbers are really percentages so point

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,240
patterns that may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for</font>

440
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,190
data breach it's the equivalent of

441
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,080
asking people how often do you work out

442
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">or half and you go to the gym and then</font>

443
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:46,250
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop their life insurance</font>

444
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:48,170
policy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them security posture an</font>

445
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization is a many dimensional</font>

446
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,490
problem and it requires data from many

447
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,100
parts of that organization and finally

448
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,240
protecting against data breaches

449
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,449
requires finding a battle on many fronts

450
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,610
you need to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro policy that is</font>

451
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,940
that applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole organization</font>

452
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:09,469
and that spans across all different sub

453
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:11,890
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't accompany lots of</font>

454
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">time for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

455
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:34,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">said Sandy Murphy Parsons so your graph</font>

456
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:36,620
that said here's all the measurements

457
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:41,210
against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have had</font>

458
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,610
break-ins so I could invent a measure

459
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,070
that just said everybody has a ninety

460
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,290
percent chance of being broken into

461
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,120
absolutely and then everybody who had an

462
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,510
incident I could say look see it's a

463
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,179
wonderful predictor have you looked at

464
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,980
yes benign examples people who are

465
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">really strong and say oh look our</font>

466
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,600
measure shows they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> there really</font>

467
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so both is a population and and for</font>

468
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,439
specifics the blue line<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this chart</font>

469
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,210
talks about the distribution for the

470
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,680
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> population which did not have</font>

471
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,290
security breaches and you can clearly

472
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">tended the distribution of scores is</font>

473
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,430
different for those but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

474
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,260
you're asking specifically for is is

475
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,360
there a distribution is there mean in

476
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,950
terms of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does an average</font>

477
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,870
organization on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet look like</font>

478
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,260
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data reported in the paper</font>

479
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,780
there was a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice 22 ha bell curve</font>

480
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,570
which focused on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

481
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,600
probability so sorry the score of point

482
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,909
five was actually where most of the

483
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,770
organization's existed and only about

484
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten percent of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations had</font>

485
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,420
scores greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty-five percent</font>

486
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,880
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> only ten percent of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations</font>

487
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,710
on that on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has scores</font>

488
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,730
greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty-five percent okay</font>

489
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:54,950
and another question is I wondered in

490
00:19:52,730 --> 00:20:01,490
your case of mismanagement if you

491
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:03,410
considered things like the release level

492
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,370
for the various pieces of software that

493
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are using and their ability to</font>

494
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:12,669
accept out-of-date crypto algorithms and

495
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,960
how fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing patches and stuff</font>

496
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,870
yes that so that's that's one of our

497
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,000
ongoing efforts right now we're looking

498
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,010
at many<font color="#CCCCCC"> many different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects of</font>

499
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,070
aggregating mismanagement information

500
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,629
both version levels patch levels so we

501
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,730
are continuing to expand that but not

502
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:32,529
for that for the results in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that paper</font>

503
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:36,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you thank you</font>

504
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:40,009
Matt<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTAC yahoo so here you have a nice</font>

505
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:43,070
chart that shows data that reinforces

506
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:44,989
your hypothesis it's the good chart that

507
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:48,739
the stuff that says look my model was

508
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:51,049
right do you have cases of companies

509
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:53,059
where breaches were reported but<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

510
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:56,239
model predicted them as having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a low</font>

511
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:59,210
probability of breach would be the first

512
00:20:56,239 --> 00:21:01,759
question and if you did have cases of

513
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,619
company breaches where your model did

514
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,869
not predict that they were likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

515
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:08,449
have a breach does that indicate that

516
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:11,539
there are additional dimensions of data

517
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:14,389
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we perhaps should be factoring in</font>

518
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:16,399
that aren't is obvious that maybe we

519
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:18,379
need to take out even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> comprehensive</font>

520
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,718
view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that's an excellent</font>

521
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:22,399
question so yes one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

522
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:23,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-profile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about high-profile</font>

523
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:25,428
hits I didn't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

524
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,080
high-profile mrs. right now one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

525
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:29,389
most important high-profile mrs. was

526
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,460
Ashley Madison for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example huge breach</font>

527
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:33,289
and according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our models they were in</font>

528
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,909
extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> low probability of reach they</font>

529
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:38,059
were they were well below the fifty

530
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:39,710
percent mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

531
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:42,489
understand why that is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if you</font>

532
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:45,109
look at their their the underlying data

533
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:48,499
from the models it also is extremely

534
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:50,658
clean yet they had a breach and we can't

535
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:53,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">really know for sure but the hypothesis</font>

536
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:56,059
there is perhaps we are unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to detect</font>

537
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:58,759
the insider threat where there is some

538
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:00,320
activity on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inside that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a</font>

539
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,529
true representation of cyber security

540
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:07,189
policy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is purely human element</font>

541
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:08,899
malicious lead<font color="#E5E5E5"> gained so if you could</font>

542
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:13,719
just find a way of measuring human

543
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:13,718
dishonesty ahead of time with this out

544
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:22,379
thank you hi this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yannick in a strike</font>

545
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:24,690
from comcast excellent talk I have a

546
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">question does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it make sense to have</font>

547
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,210
among predictors or maybe you already

548
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:34,110
didn't I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't catch it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also in</font>

549
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,600
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense how um I don't know how</font>

550
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,949
sensitive a target something is because

551
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:44,070
I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all else being equal</font>

552
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:47,970
one type of companies may be more of a

553
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:50,340
target as opposed you know like sort of

554
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,680
sighs I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you did have size of</font>

555
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:56,520
company but maybe some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of measure</font>

556
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:58,080
of prominence number of mentions you

557
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the press or something like that</font>

558
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,980
like some entities may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more prone to</font>

559
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:07,590
being attacked than others absolutely so

560
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,570
you're right the the output of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

561
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,939
is only going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as accurate or as</font>

562
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,860
useful as the input data that went into

563
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,720
training it so we're hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font>

564
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the factors that you're talking about</font>

565
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,310
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> target ability or target</font>

566
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,350
preference is also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show up in</font>

567
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:25,050
the historical data that we're using to

568
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:29,219
build our labels so if circumspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

569
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:31,260
is off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of if a certain sector like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

570
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,030
financial sector or the energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> sector is</font>

571
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,340
more likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be targeted our</font>

572
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:38,850
expectation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that that will it show up</font>

573
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:41,250
in the historical reports data breach

574
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:50,030
reports as well and that bias will then

575
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:50,030
drive the Train models as well good

576
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:58,809
this one I was just asking but you don't

577
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,779
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it explicitly as a feature you</font>

578
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:04,029
think that just that financial companies

579
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:06,789
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some sense described by</font>

580
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever features you using rather than</font>

581
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:14,080
having a categorical you know future

582
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,720
financial vs that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we did try</font>

583
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">to include sector level information this</font>

584
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,980
is something we're working on right now

585
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:23,320
but as it turns out mapping

586
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,149
organizations to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sectors is by is in</font>

587
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,950
itself a challenging task and in a lot

588
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:29,699
of cases it has to be done manually by

589
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:32,020
scrubbing through the data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hear you</font>

590
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:40,990
if you know if a good data source please

591
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:42,908
let's talk hi Jay Galle infinera I was

592
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:46,690
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask questions very similar to</font>

593
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:49,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of these about how you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

594
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:52,059
confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had enough data</font>

595
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:55,330
sources to cover the range of different

596
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:57,850
risk factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things like being on</font>

597
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,639
outdated software loads and stuff like

598
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,080
that you we could probably do a poll<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

599
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,750
people in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and come up with a</font>

602
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:14,110
I'm of the same mind that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

603
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:16,179
commenters were that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> model is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

604
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:19,090
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very incomplete for a very long</font>

605
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:20,529
time precisely<font color="#E5E5E5"> because people don't know</font>

606
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,490
where the risks are and they don't

607
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:27,909
reveal what their own internal risk

608
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,500
profile is in a way that is obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

609
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:31,000
the outside world but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

610
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,270
follow up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different question</font>

611
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,760
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as anybody from Wall Street ask</font>

you for your data<font color="#CCCCCC"> sets so they can short</font>

613
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,179
companies that have the highest risk

614
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:49,149
scores<font color="#E5E5E5"> I yes let's talk about that</font>

615
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:51,250
offline and in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the expanding or</font>

620
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:05,470
we've been since included a much broader

621
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,150
set of policy indicators for examples

622
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,929
things like whether you have a policy

623
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:12,880
for managing development web servers

624
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:14,380
people in a lot of organizations people
