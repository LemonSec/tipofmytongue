at nanog is in charge of the actual

109
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,489
structure and content of the program and

110
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:03,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is pretty much all it does pay</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things like budgets we do not do things</font>

114
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,329
like you know hotel contracts that's why

115
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:13,369
we have a board that's why we have an

116
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,809
executive director so if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on</font>

00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,739
program committees for other conferences

118
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,029
where you end up being kind of the

119
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:18,529
jack-of-all-trades this is good you get

120
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:19,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">the focus on content you get the folks</font>

121
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:21,769
on the ideas that people are putting

122
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:24,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward and how well they fit with this</font>

audience the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time commitment</font>

124
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,999
are going to have basically what we do

125
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:31,998
is about six sometimes seven one hour

126
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:34,309
meetings that run up towards the nanog

127
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:36,229
cycle each cycle that's every four

128
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:38,089
months plus you're going to need to

129
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend about I would say four to six</font>

130
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,610
hours but roughly the same amount of

131

<font color="#CCCCCC">time that you would spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

people are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to submit material</font>

136
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:53,299
reviewing abstracts doing things like

137

that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not a lot of time when</font>

138
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,719
you consider that spread out over the

<font color="#CCCCCC">course of four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months when you get here</font>

00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:02,388
maybe three<font color="#CCCCCC"> to four hours doing things</font>

142
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:03,529
like participating in meetings<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

the bottom the female attendants is

236
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,670
growing but it's still a very

237
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,860
underrepresented number so we have

238
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:39,550
scholarships and fellowships and if

239
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:43,330

<font color="#CCCCCC">some comparison just to see how we've</font>

247
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:14,439
changed there we go by org this is a

248
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,650
little interesting to me today in terms

249
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,640
of seeing how some of the percentages

250
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:26,709
have changed not much but it's still

251
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:30,160
different and the future meeting dates

252
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:33,250

254
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,980
