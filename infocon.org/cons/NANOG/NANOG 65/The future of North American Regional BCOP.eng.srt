00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:38,449
the best current operational practices

10
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:40,339
both regionally and globally normally we

11
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:43,940
do a best current operational practices

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,970
track at nanog but enough is evolving

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,489
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the with the track and efforts for</font>

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,530
coordination globally we figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a</font>

15
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:56,510
submit a request for presentation in

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:01:00,219
general session so first how many how

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,219
many first timers are still in the room

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:07,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay then I'll give a brief</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> history of</font>

19
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:09,640
what be cop is so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind best</font>

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,580
current operational practices is that

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,220
there is a one or multiple searchable

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,710
repositories for best current

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,340
operational practices that is you know

24
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:25,039
how do I subnet a v6 subnet or what is

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,810
the best standard for knobs that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,240
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interface facing and internet</font>

27
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,220
exchange things that you would normally

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,320
go out and search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for to find what is</font>

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,619
the best solution that is considered

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,639
vetted and accurate and and and a good

31
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:42,259
operational practice to do a period so

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,200
we identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem some time ago</font>

33
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:47,869
to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know most people will find a</font>

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,420
qualified search engine or ask a

35
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:53,060
colleague or go to your local

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,939
operational forum and search through

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,320
archive presentations the challenge of

38
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">course with those is that they're not</font>

39
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really vetted and certainly not current</font>

40
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,100
right if you pull up an old presentation

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,369
it's really hard to tell if a practice

42
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,320
has changed or<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolved since then so the</font>

43
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea behind these repositories is not</font>

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">only to have best current operational</font>

45
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:15,078
practices documented but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to regularly</font>

46
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,079
check up on them to say is this still a

47
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:20,120
valid method for doing this still the

48
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:21,889
current and best way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font>

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,750
groups of subject matter experts to

50
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,290
regularly review and discuss and update

51
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,290
these documents

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,379
historically this has lived at in this

53
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:38,129
region has lived at BK org but we've

54
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:41,609
migrated this off to a separate site due

55
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,440
to the board suggesting that it's not

56
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,819
really a standards body and separating

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,390
some of these things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them on</font>

58
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:51,420
their own entity it turns out that

59
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,298
effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is good timing as we've</font>

60
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,798
really done a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on global</font>

61
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,640
coordination and trying to put this into

62
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:02,370
a single place but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for now we have a</font>

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,238
regional site called<font color="#E5E5E5"> nab cop org where</font>

64
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,370
you can find current ratified best

current operational practices things

66
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,769
that are in progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a list of</font>

67
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:19,440
things that are to be picked up by

68
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:21,540
subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter experts and documented so</font>

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,790
due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these some changes basically</font>

70
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,400
what's happened is that banana board

71
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,950
delegated track decisions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program</font>

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,930
committee and there are now taking on

73
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,108
more responsibility and evaluating all

74
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,030
the tracks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally between nanos</font>

75
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:39,630
what we do is concentrate heavily on

76
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,609
working on the evolution of of documents

77
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,950
and at the tracks we present what's

78
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:45,599
happened since the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last one find more</font>

79
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,060
subject matter exports get more feedback

80
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,578
get more vetting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and either move forward</font>

81
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">towards ratification or push back out to</font>

82
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:58,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">the community for more changes and</font>

83
00:03:52,019 --> 00:04:00,030

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">know will it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to to meet at</font>

rooms or you know pubs afterward is not

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,139
really important but we intend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

88
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">continue to have meetings at operational</font>

89
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,299
forums but going forward tracks will

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,769
actually be proposed to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC at each</font>

91
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:21,510
meeting we're also certainly evaluating

92
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,970
other forums in the region<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,550
outreach<font color="#E5E5E5"> for PC LPS whether that's like</font>

94
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,340
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> canadian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isp summits or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carib</font>

95
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,900
nog but other operator forums where we

96
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,250
know that there are subject matter

97
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,859
experts and there are people certainly

98
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,419
looking for information on best friend

99
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,430
operational practices or how to actually

100
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,969
solve you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> various problems that we</font>

101
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,079
may not know

102
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:45,529
about we're currently in search of a

103
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,929
regional home for for this repository

104
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:50,759
right now I've got these hosted<font color="#E5E5E5"> off-site</font>

105
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:53,669
that probably should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be at an</font>

106
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,829
organization so we're evaluating various

107
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,169
organizations to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense as</font>

108
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:02,399
a standards body in this region to help

109
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:03,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">host this as an organization the</font>

110
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,149
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the work that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens we</font>

112
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,989
out discussions and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> even places</font>

113
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,479
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll pull someone to</font>

114
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:13,948
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side and ask for help vetting</font>

115
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,769
something or asked for help authoring

116
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:19,319
something and usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> these operator</font>

117
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:20,849
operator forums are just used for you

118
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">know updating the community as to what's</font>

119
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:28,049
happened since the last time it's been

120
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,459
discussed so best current operational

121
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:33,149
practices have actually been growing

122
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:35,879
globally we've seen these pop up in

123
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,379
regions all over the world and they are

124
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,409
growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at various rates and have</font>

125
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:42,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">different levels of participation but</font>

126
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,289
it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting evolution</font>

127
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,849
where we're finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font>

128
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:49,159
certainly interest all over the world

129
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:49,159
and that's that's quite fantastic

130
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:52,708
because there are so many popping up and

131
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">we found that there have been some</font>

132
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:56,909
duplicated efforts in various different

133
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:59,249
places and we realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

134
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:00,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">several different repositories we've</font>

135
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:02,489
been working heavily on global

136
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:07,619
coordination for the last several months

137
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:09,119
Oh while we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that and trying to</font>

138
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:11,159
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the best method is for</font>

putting this in a global repository that

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:20,009
makes sense work has continued on every

single regional bc o P as well we're

143

seeing regular new submissions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> since</font>

the last nanog just regionally we've

145
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:33,059
ratified a couple of B Cup oh sorry

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,529
of these i know and i'll move forward

168
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,479
very quickly this is about establishing

169
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:47,870
conventions for formatting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

170

standards this is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know purpose</font>

171
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,620
of preserving existing human facing

173
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:58,669
formatted information that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy</font>

174
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:02,539
for machines to parse them and yet still

175
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:04,448
easily human readable the conventions

176
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,500
for supporting tooling and automation

177
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,939
the idea here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it should be</font>

178
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,889
general enough and useful for any

179
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:12,710
service and not just network services

180
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:17,539
and create libraries and example scripts

181
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:19,430
to support implementation so this has

182
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,919
got a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been started the</font>

individually to their own methodologies

00:09:50,610 --> 00:10:01,259
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really following a standard so</font>

219
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:04,980
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us got together in Prague at</font>

IETF 93 and had the first meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

all of whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to call the P</font>

are just running lists people just

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,370
volunteering your time to coordinate

226
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:23,610
efforts and we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was</font>

227
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:25,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a very useful useful path to to</font>

228
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,250
coordinate efforts so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not stepping</font>

229
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:32,160
on each other's toes or duplicating

230
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,459
efforts in regions and have a single

231
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,649
searchable repository and we had a very

232
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:41,160
useful discussion you know it was we

233
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:49,680
determined that the IETF made sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

234
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:52,949
a good home excuse me<font color="#CCCCCC"> good water let the</font>

235
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,138
IETF was probably the best home for for

236
00:10:52,949 --> 00:11:00,240
global coordination and that as we

237
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,269
reviewed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list of documents being</font>

238
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,769
worked on throughout the regions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

239
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,589
the majority of things being worked on

240
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:09,720
were considered global practices right

241
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,639
so you know if we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about subnetting</font>

242
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,709
or standards on exchanges or interfaces

243
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,680
on routers or practices that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally</font>

244
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,699
do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> overwhelming majority fall under</font>

245
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,150
a global category

246
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,190
you know a regional example might be

247
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,939
what is the best practice for

248
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,040
interacting with my local law

249
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,300
enforcement I'm clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not a</font>

250
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,319
document that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered</font>

251
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:36,849
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a global</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DCOP but the</font>

252
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,220
overwhelming majority are so you know we

253
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,230
had a fairly detailed discussion about

254
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,260
what a plan would be to go forward to

255
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:47,440
have some global coordination had a

256
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,360
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the RFC editors and talk</font>

257
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,620
through the options for interacting with

258
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,890
the IETF and the outcome of that was

259
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,760
that you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got support from the</font>

260
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:03,550
ITF that this makes sense it didn't have

261
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,130
a particular area that was clear based

262
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">on our conversation but that we could</font>

263
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:12,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the independent submission stream</font>

264
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,589
starting with some low-hanging flute to

265
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,690
determine where that actually should

266
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:19,089
live you know should<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be the ops ad</font>

267
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,430
should it be some other AD should we

268
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,200
create a new ad but the way going

269
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:28,739
forward was to start with something that

270
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">was common easy to work with easy to get</font>

271
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:36,070
a agreement that they are a global

272
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:40,540
document and submit through the

273
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,370
independent submission stream as we're

274
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,140
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're going to take the time</font>

275
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:50,800
to template eyes how to operate a<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cop</font>

276
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,420
track or be cop group in a region so we

277
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,959
know that we've all had some successes

278
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and failures and that some areas some</font>

279
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,550
regions are moving along faster than

280
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,529
others so we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd be a good idea</font>

281
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,150
to actually template eyes this process

282
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,189
and document it somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a common</font>

283
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,140
place so anybody can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up and say</font>

284
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,580
you know here's what worked in these

285
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,230
regions here's what didn't work in these

286
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:16,900
regions and don't make the same mistakes

287
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:21,760
wherever you're trying it so going

288
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:23,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward we did register gbk org for a</font>

289
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,750
global repository there's currently

going there

292
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,310
we've started some lists to combine all

293
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,520
of the regional efforts for both a

participant lists into a single list on

progress working with the RFC editors on

301
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,970
on how we streamlined process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to be a learning experience</font>

303
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,279
for all of us but it was really pleasant

304
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,260
to work with the editors and hear how

305

345
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:08,630
intersection with the ITF because I also

346
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,829
play there occasionally and I'll be

347
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:15,310
watching I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how this fits</font>

348
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:20,930
logically the ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> has stayed away from</font>

349
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:23,779
this edge and working with RFC it and

350
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,859
the obstetric will be interesting I'm

351
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:29,120
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I don't mean that</font>

352
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,279
sarcastically yeah no I hear you could

353
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the IETF and it could change the</font>

354
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,240
way we do operational documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

355
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,040
might not be all bad exactly you know

356
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,990
the hope is exactly that that we get

357
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,120
actually close this loop and have real

358
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,890
operators have feedback into the IETF

359
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,870
and you know the long-term lovely

360
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:50,660
outcome would be that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have</font>

361
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:52,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a full loop hi Kathy Aronson</font>

362
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,850
just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on what Randy was saying</font>

363
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,190
there are a couple ways that we've

364
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,490
talked about to go within the ITF one

365
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,589
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opts working group that</font>

366
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,959
doesn't necessarily meet at an ietf is

367
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,579
one way to go but another way to go is

368
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,020
some independence and missions and then

369
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually having a separate document</font>

370
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,869
stream like the IRT<font color="#E5E5E5"> eft has that would</font>

371
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,689
just be for these kind of documents so

372
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:19,510
it sort of depends on how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolves</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

373
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:24,880
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of options</font>

374
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:27,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are potential I think how documents</font>

375
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,850
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents are reviewable will be</font>

376
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,530
critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 IETF</font>

377
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:38,310
weenies each at wanting to add value

378
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll go crazy that that's true and the</font>

379
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:43,750
the independent submissions are just

380
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,879
reviewed to see whether they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can flicked</font>

381
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,560
with existing ITF work and since there's

382
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,550
not much operationally going on at the

383
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">IDF it's probably ok but if we had an</font>

386
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,500
community would be quite a bit more so

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:05,320
yep back microphone sure Phil Roberts

388
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,660
Internet Society one thing I didn't hear

389
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,110
you mention when I hear regional I don't

390
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:15,490
anticipate a lot of actual operational

391
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:18,729
practice differences but maybe language

392
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,320
differences right<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you had any kind</font>

393
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">of input about getting these things</font>

394
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,230
documented in languages other than

395
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:29,020
English yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the items that</font>

396
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">we discussed actually at great length</font>

397
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,780
was how do we actually make best current

398
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,810
operational practices documented for

399
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,910
global availability we certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font>

400
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:43,330
with some folks who were happy to help

401
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">with translation and you know Heather</font>

402
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:49,360
Flanagan specifically was talking about

403
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:53,800
implementing a new richer format at the

404
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,659
IETF to allow for this kind of standard

405
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,780
and this kind of translation going

406
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,760
forward so those are certainly

407
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,800
considerations and of great<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern</font>

408
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,800
right there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example some</font>

409
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,470
fantastic operational documents written

412
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely a consideration point I know</font>

413
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,290
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working on trying to make</font>

414
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,620
that easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to translate and I think</font>

415
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:24,070
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see progress on that very shortly</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">temkin Netflix so I'm heartened to see</font>

418
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,559
the progress that you've made here

419
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:34,918
think that I personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> am in agreement</font>

420
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,529
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> direction one of the biggest</font>

421
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,499
things that that concerned me in the

422
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:42,539
past with this was the idea that you

423
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:43,979
know it's a regional effort that makes a

424
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,229
ton of sense however<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a global</font>

425
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:47,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet and at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the day the</font>

426
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:49,829
reason why the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet works is because</font>

427
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:53,219
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a global network and so obviously</font>

428
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:56,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">having standards or be cops in conflict</font>

429
00:19:53,219 --> 00:20:01,469
between regions just doesn't work and so

430
00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:03,269
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you know</font>

431
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:06,059
you're not directly standards or you're

432
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,919
not an enforcement org but how do we and

433
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,329
this is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a meta question because</font>

434
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,579
you know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got three minutes to</font>

435
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:13,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">filter the lunch how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we get teeth on</font>

436
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,839
any of these how do we make sure that

437
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,789
again if these are for the good and the

438
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,009
stability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the internet that people</font>

439
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:22,289
actually abide by them how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

440
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:24,509
have we heard bcp 38 you know and every

441
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:27,509
other for the good of the internet

442
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:30,239
standard that yet you know the bad

443
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:32,279
actors don't use the good actors do the

444
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:35,159
end of the day it's the bad actors that

445
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:39,179
screw everything up yeah wholeheartedly

446
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:40,709
agreed and in particular with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp 38</font>

447
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,409
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a long discussion with</font>

448
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:46,739
Medicaid about this and and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

449
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:48,749
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hopefully these have real</font>

450
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:51,690
useful simple to follow how to

451
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,820
guidelines as well and you know for

452
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,559
whatever it may sound like an RFC is

453
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,149
sometimes hard to read for people who

454
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,219
are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at an operational practice</font>

455
00:20:57,149 --> 00:21:01,859
document and hopefully we can make these

456
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:04,889
in clean simple language that people can

457
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:07,228
follow and you know and the hope of

458
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,939
course is that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually execute you</font>

459
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:11,129
know enforcement is a really funny word

460
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,839
and and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's always a</font>

461
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:17,458
collaborative community thing you know

462
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:19,079
we can say as a community you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

463
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:21,089
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way we accept routing objects</font>

464
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,289
these are the requirements for joining

465
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:24,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">in exchange</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you're going to be in</font>

466
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,549
quarantine until you follow them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

467
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:27,899
here's a document you can read to follow

468
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:30,179
those rather than having to get them

469
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:34,258
from every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single exchanged you know and</font>

470
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:37,409
I think the more we start to use them in

471
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:38,729
that that that method will see that

472
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:41,470
enforcement comes from the community

473
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:43,799
naturally yeah

474
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,909
just to close out that thought really

475
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,010
that's what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is more</font>

476
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:50,350
outreach from that aspect which is that

477
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,960
getting people to buy off on you know if

478
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,030
you could get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> network the size of</font>

479
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,100
level 3 to buy off on you need to follow

480
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,629
this B Cup in order to turn up a bgp

481
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:10,389
session with us that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be phenomenal</font>

482
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:11,799
yep can let me talk this time yep excuse

483
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,630
me hang on hang on hang on for a second

484
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,150
um I want to make it very clear that

485
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,710
lunch is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> next the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lightning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talks</font>

486
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">for next it might start by the way yes</font>

487
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,039
no lightning talks our next lunch is not

488
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,030
let next and I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I</font>

489
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,030
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take the next two questions</font>

490
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay Brandon Brandon Ross network</font>

491
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:33,820
utility force so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to register my</font>

492
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,440
disagreement actually with with Dave we

493
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,149
work with a large number of very small

494
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,580
providers many of them very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well at</font>

495
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,370
North America especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the US and</font>

496
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,918
its it while I definitely understand the

497
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,590
dichotomy between international and

498
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,480
global standards and not the bottom line

499
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">is if we want small service providers to</font>

500
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,900
follow be cops which is often where a

501
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,280
lot of the problems are they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not</font>

502
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen to a document that says</font>

503
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,389
ripe on it they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just they're just not</font>

504
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,919
they they they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify with that</font>

505
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,169
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey this was created here in</font>

506
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,120
North America it makes a big difference

507
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,740
and and I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's not</font>

508
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,899
logical and it should not be that way

509
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it simply is that way and i work</font>

510
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,559
with large number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys and they</font>

511
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,219
just they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen to a</font>

512
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:18,280
document that comes from outside the US

513
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,559
and its it's sad that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

514
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,789
think having multiple sources of those

515
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,789
kind of documents makes it more likely

516
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:29,110
that we'll be able to get work surface

517
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:31,929
waters to follow Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> bhushan i J first</font>

518
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,330
of all half the things they do or came

519
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,669
from ripe documents you want bc p38

520
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,780
maybe you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the IRR look</font>

521
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:43,840
for right document 81 um but well I care

522
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,789
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin is we're making structures of</font>

523
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,459
where to publish and who to publish and

524
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:50,370
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enforce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it look for me right</font>

525
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,390
a dozen

526
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:57,419
good documents physics will see that

527
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:01,380
they find homes yeah that's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

528
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:04,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">ality of the protein is what matters not</font>

529
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,540
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lettuce tomato and wrappings</font>

530
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,100
wholeheartedly agree and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

531
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,899
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happened is now we have</font>

532
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,689
you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple dozen documents spread</font>

533
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,540
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> six or seven different operator</font>

534
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">operator forums and and this idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

535
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,440
aggregate them you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if people</font>

536
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,210
review them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide that it's garbage</font>

537
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,890
then I'm sure it'll get shut down on the

538
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,330
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> will end and if people review</font>

539
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,220
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start actually utilizing them</font>

540
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:33,500
and find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually useful it</font>

541
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:33,500
will grow thank you very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>
