00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,150
generally a review of things you've

for those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you who haven't I wanted to</font>

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,089
go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,619
run into at my current job over over the

00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:53,750
years so let's go to the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so</font>

16
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:57,019
there are multiple issues that cause

00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:01,030
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic engineering policies to</font>

basically impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns our impact those</font>

20
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:10,100
that basically supply an application

over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet some of those te</font>

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,408
policies are applied due to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

23
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:18,229
whether the issue is a link being

24
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,630
congested and traffic need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be shifted</font>

25
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:22,670
off it whether it's an end customer of

26
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,310
the ISP complaining about their current

27
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,909
traffic paths and wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shift</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:32,140
to a better one poor baby you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could just</font>

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,720
but really it's the issue ones are

31
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,080
temporary hopefully and are ones that

32
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,060
I'll go into a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more but its</font>

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,220
more common one<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i have found</font>

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,670
we're looking at you and looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

35
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,620
issues on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the second one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,090
engineer policy is applied in response

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,040
to a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement and this is</font>

38
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,020
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a little bit trickier we'll</font>

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,880
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little bit more this</font>

40
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,619
essentially is where you start getting

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,420
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the settlement free interconnect</font>

42
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,549
agreements or the peering agreements and

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,590
you start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about links being out</font>

44
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,720
of ratio or you have companies fighting

45
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,330
over the settlement freak interconnects

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,299
either by not shifting traffic off and

47
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,980
leaving congested or you know shifting

48
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:18,080
it off completely in order to get back

49
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,950
in the ratio and not be in violation and

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,959
that sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two and</font>

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,510
three and three being a change in formal

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,160
relationship basically they're they're

53
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,299
kind of linked because there are times

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,880
where a company is small and

55
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a transit customer but when they</font>

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,200
grow bigger or their acquired and they

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,810
go into under their parent company they

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,359
transition from a transit customer into

59
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,360
a pure right a settlement free customer

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,420
and dude it a lot of default<font color="#E5E5E5"> policies</font>

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,980
ISPs do that also has an impact right if

62
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,040
it becomes a de facto traffic

63
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,170
engineering shift we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">present and they're always going to be</font>

65
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,390
there miss configuration problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,000
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy that is misapplied or not</font>

67
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,549
applied at all ends up doing a route

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,250
leak that Charles traffic away from

69
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,790
where it's supposed to go or cuts off

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:16,080
route announcement making that link not

71
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,880
a great path that can be taken the last

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,130
point added here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

73
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,280
it's a problem that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely ran</font>

74
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,950
into when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went from na s per region</font>

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,720
to a single global yes I know others

76
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,040
have done that transition may have run

77
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,060
into similar problems and that is when

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you're around announcements</font>

79
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,610
are coming out of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific region with</font>

80
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:41,280
a specific source a s you could

81
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,280
generally avoid mostly these problems

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,780
not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and not all the time but</font>

83
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you go to the single global</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ass and</font>

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,709
you have all your announcements coming

85
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,090
out every point these problems become a

86
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:55,080
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more prevalent and they hit</font>

87
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,180
you a little bit hard so let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

88
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first one and I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you</font>

89
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">now up front I'm not great at drawing so</font>

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,609
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the same drawing</font>

91
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,100
multiple times because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kept</font>

92
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,480
reusing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would prefer a whiteboard</font>

93
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,130
that I could draw on and you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

94
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,209
look at that and someone could come up

95
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a race and we can have good</font>

96
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,310
discussion so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best one</font>

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,488
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get out of me apologize</font>

98
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,620
but essentially what we have here is a

99
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:22,469
issue response right the ideal path is

100
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,770
is BA 2 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC getting to the CDN right</font>

101
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,419
and by a deal I mean either distance

102
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,490
wise or speed of light comes into play

103
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,969
or congestion wise where buffering comes

104
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,460
into play it is the least delayed path

105
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:38,789
right it is the fastest path between the

106
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,700
end customer and the CDN now when the

107
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:44,139
traffic shift occurs right either a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV</font>

108
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,628
policy or the link between is VA and

109
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,180
CC goes down or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

110
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:52,240
where the shift moves to I the path

111
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,849
through is PB we get to a scenario where

112
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,189
it is what we would call inefficient as

113
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:00,219
far as we're concerned right it's not

114
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:02,199
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet doesn't get there it's</font>

115
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:05,498
the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that packet is</font>

116
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,150
taking is detrimental to the metrics

117
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:12,610
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to measure against for</font>

118
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:14,529
our service right this scenario what it

119
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,620
from state issue also is when in

120
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:19,419
customer a as I say here obviously on

121
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,639
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide I want to read it to you I</font>

122
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:24,549
reports an issue whether it's an attack

123
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether it's a issue with the link that</font>

124
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,949
they're noticing and someone calls in it

125
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,590
does a shift in general shifts done due

126
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:34,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to issues when we contact the ISPs and</font>

127
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,068
talk to them are generally temporary

128
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:42,159
nature or at least we hope the temporary

129
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:43,870
nature and it usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just back the</font>

130
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,580
second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want to talk about is</font>

131
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,339
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> a business requirement all right</font>

132
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,710
te policy applied due to a business

133
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:52,900
requirement so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we start</font>

134
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,549
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that great subject that I</font>

135
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,138
<font color="#CCCCCC">know not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all gets discussed before and</font>

136
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,729
all the papers have discussed before

137
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,399
right settlement free interconnect

138
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,789
fights between companies between ISPs

139
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,759
because links have gone on a ratio this

140
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:09,909
is a particular fight that impacts us we

141
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:13,870
are the splash damage right of the sites

142
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:16,149
between ISPs they're having a fight due

143
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,879
to their management or do whatever the

144
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:21,159
cause is but even though we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

145
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,830
party to that fight the traffic shift

146
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:25,330
that occurs or the traffic loss of the

287
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">back right every two way is it 200</font>

288
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:28,000
millisecond hit so what's the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

289
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,920
our millisecond well for us we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,230
thing most of you may be familiar what's

291
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,630
called time to first byte that is

292
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically describing when we've gotten</font>

293
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,010
the handshakes done for<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP when we've</font>

294
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,810
gotten a hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 done for TLS and we're</font>

295
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,550
able to start handing the first byte

296
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,329
actually related to the web page we're

297
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,859
trying to load right for our<font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font>

298
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,330
for us we have a metric we called end

299
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,220
user page time but it's all more

300
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,840
commonly known as average<font color="#E5E5E5"> page time and</font>

301
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,320
that's how long it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes us to load the</font>

302
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,260
entire page so between<font color="#E5E5E5"> those two metrics</font>

303
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,680
the increase in delay in the inefficient

304
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,200
path would essentially increase the time

305
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,180
until we get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bite of our</font>

307
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,560
handshakes to have to occur between us

308
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,420
and the end customer for the end user

309
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,780
page time that's how long it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes us to</font>

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,640
render<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire thing the UI the user</font>

311
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,689
picks the actual customer data they're

312
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,030
pulling up and each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those because of</font>

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,640
the mechanisms of the underlying

protocols and mechanisms involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

315
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,260
get the additional delay hit all this of

316
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,888
course leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the third one which is</font>

317
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,869
customer complaints customers do notice

318
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,519
and when they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working all</font>

319
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:41,199
morning and they go to lunch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

320
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,749
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of a sudden that page</font>

321
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,639
is seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's going twice as slow</font>

322
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:47,859
or three times as slow as it was when

323
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,759
they came in they're absolutely going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

324
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:53,949
pick up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they get me and</font>

325
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,689
because we're a global company like most

326
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:58,269
CD ends it's not like we have a good

329
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,209
working that America is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the office</font>

330
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,009

working<font color="#CCCCCC"> asia-pac is in the office</font>

332
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:11,160
working so customer complaints are all

333
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,970
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there customer perception on</font>

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:19,389
how long it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to load that page or</font>

335
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,059
is often not it's a perception issue

336
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:24,189
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the exact time that actually</font>

337
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,629
took the load but to the customer is

338
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:28,358
taking longer and that's all they know

339
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:29,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">so they call and complain in our case</font>

340
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:31,869
it's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more difficult in a</font>

341
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,779
month in the quarter and two fiscal are

342
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:36,339
big deals for sales so<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time during</font>

343
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,649
those periods where we have a page slow

344
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:41,499
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> even as little as a 200 millisecond</font>

345
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,149
shift in a path that leads to a

346
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">tremendous amount of complaints and it</font>

347
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,629
has our ops groups and site reliability

348
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,959
groups scrambling to figure out what

349
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:53,379
happened so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that a</font>

350
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:55,268
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit one of the difficulties we</font>

351
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:58,119
have is trying to divine dinner

352
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:02,230
intentions of why what occurred occurred

353
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:04,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right why did that shift occur why</font>

354
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,819
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it taking a different path no we</font>

355
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:08,379
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's malicious at least for</font>

356
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:13,059
the vast majority of the time it's not

357
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:15,339
malicious but we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we're</font>

358
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint this is the internet for</font>

359
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,139
a lot of our customers that are crossing

360
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:21,819
multiple isps get to us so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

361
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:23,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">start looking at our monitoring tools to</font>

362
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:26,618
try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what are in the path</font>

363
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:29,019
that it shifts why did it shift so the

364
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:32,169
other difficulty is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the times</font>

365
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,970
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our company and if I'm sure</font>

366
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:35,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">for silver others we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a formal</font>

367
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,959
relationship with<font color="#CCCCCC"> dyess peas in the</font>

368
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:40,169
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> right they're not our upstream</font>

369
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,238
they're not our end customers upstream

370
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:44,949
so with these difficulties in mind you

371
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:49,569
have to be careful about how you

372
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:49,760
approach and how you basically contact

373
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:51,110
them

374
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:57,050
in order to try to resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> these issues</font>

375
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:59,330
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is nanog this is for ops</font>

376
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,640
generally all of us have either at one

377
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,190
time worked in operations or still

378
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,080
currently work in operations the first

379
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,080
point is basically the biggest point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

380
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,240
like to make no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoys someone</font>

381
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,010
calling them up screaming right you've

382
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,320
all had to deal with customers that

383
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,240
called in stark raving mad cursing up a

384
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,100
storm yelling about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you the cost in</font>

385
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,740
the millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars in revenue etc</font>

386
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,900
etc you've all had to do take the time

387
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,190
to try to calm them down while trying to

388
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">get information out of them so you can</font>

389
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:31,210
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the problem is and</font>

390
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:33,650
resolving right keeping that in mind

391
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,660
basically and going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my previous</font>

392
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,319
slide if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have no formal relationship</font>

393
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,270
and you call in a confrontational manner

394
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,910
that is P engineering group with ops<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

395
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,890
end whoever has no compunction to work

396
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,510
with you right and there's no

397
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">repercussions for them not working with</font>

398
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,780
you you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a paying customer their</font>

399
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,820
management is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to hold you</font>

400
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,420
accountable<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold them accountable</font>

401
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,670
rather so you're basically asking for a

402
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,579
favor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help engineer to engineer to</font>

403
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,959
resolve an issue and the best way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

404
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,300
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the approach should approach it</font>

405
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,579
professionally talk engineer the

406
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,589
engineer and you'd be surprised how many

407
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,240
isps are willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with you and</font>

408
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,440
figure out the problem even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

409
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not a paying customer right it's</font>

410
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,970
a key point the second point add you

411
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,250
here is an option I added<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here I</font>

412
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,380
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily agree with it every</font>

413
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,690
time when I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ops when I thought</font>

414
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a multi-party call to troubleshoot</font>

415
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,960
an issue it made me shudder because it

416
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:35,149
really is generally not a good idea but

417
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,250
sometimes you can get if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP you're</font>

418
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,800
having a problem with is the upstream

419
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,420
for your end customer it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an option if</font>

420
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,550
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer is having that much for</font>

421
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,290
problem but doesn't have the technical

422
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,290
expertise to actually talk to the ISP

423
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,600
about what it is however this is going

424
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,520
to be rare the end customers sometimes

425
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,669
will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> look it's your problem not mine</font>

426
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,370
you need to fix it now to the CDN or

427
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,320
will tell the ISP to contact or if this

428
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">refused to just won't know how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

429
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,070
when don't want to do it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

430
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,529
really a courtesy if they really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

431
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,389
do it and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time you have to</font>

432
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:11,250
hope the ISP team really wants to work

433
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you right for the reasons I even</font>

434
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,049
personally sometimes hesitate on getting

435
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,090
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi company calls to try to</font>

436
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:21,210
troubleshoot something let's be honest

437
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,799
they're not always awesome so I put it

438
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,419
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is an option I don't</font>

439
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,399
really recommend that option unless you

440
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:31,590
have no other you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know no other approach</font>

441
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:33,149
that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we were to</font>

442
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,889
some solutions these are kind of generic

443
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:37,469
but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them you can</font>

444
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:39,928
as a CD and you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

445
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,840
engineering or to mitigate the problem

446
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:45,630
you just ran into this dough really

447
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,570
turns into whack Amole routing so you

448
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,309
have one of the scenarios out my before

449
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,200
you decide to go ahead and say ok for

450
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,639
this provider i'm going to prepend it

451
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,139
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that provider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to add this</font>

453
00:18:55,139 --> 00:19:00,689
go out over there great perfect you just

454
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,070
solve that problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately what</font>

455
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also did is probably create five</font>

456
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,480
more problems because there's a bunch of

457
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISPs in the world and you just shifted</font>

458

459
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:14,850
fixing that one you are actually shifted

460
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,309
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for four so it while it is an option</font>

461
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,918
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your ops team ragged</font>

462
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:23,460
chasing down problem after problem more

463
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,990
importantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't believe I have it up</font>

464
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,919
here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is an option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

465
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,210
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term it's not sustainable</font>

466
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,399
hopefully your ops team somewhere has a

467
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,399
documentation repository that they keep

468
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:37,018
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all the snowflake policies</font>

reference that for window staff that you

<font color="#E5E5E5">have dealing with this leaves and the</font>

473
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,230
new guys two years later come in and

474
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,409
they're wondering why those policies are

475
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,539
their long-term sustainment<font color="#E5E5E5"> there hurts</font>

476
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:54,510
it's not great it also breaks

477
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:56,370
standardization the few times that we've

478
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,720
had to do it we've actually had to do it

479
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,340
in a way where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the standardized</font>

480
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,519
across our environment in order to keep

481
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:05,730
standardization and to keep the load of

482
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:08,669
snow flakes off our operations team but

483
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:11,159
it really is a last<font color="#E5E5E5"> resort to try to</font>

484
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:13,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">address it and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't highly recommend</font>

485
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,720
it the second is you can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

486
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,010
ISP to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to undo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what happened four</font>

487

cases of the Audi

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,920
or miss configuration that's probably

489
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,080
already happening anyways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">people's happy to work with you do let</font>

491
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,949
you know maybe give you updates you know

492
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,890
long as it doesn't you know impact their

493
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,960
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem but I</font>

494
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,300
mean working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the ISPs is still the</font>

495
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,480
IDS ideal scenario try to come up with a

496
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,850
fix that doesn't require you or they to

497
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,930
deploy snowflake policies that are

498
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically going to break their</font>

499
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:45,900
sanitation right and finally you could

500
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,000
do this we did it with a few ISPs which

501
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,040
is you can ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for or create bgp</font>

502
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,660
communities to do a certain te function

503
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,750
the problem with this one as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well is</font>

504
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,740
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is trying to handle a single</font>

505
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:04,470
specific problem and while isp specific

506
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,880
communities can work within that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> p as</font>

507
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:11,370
a CDN it makes the middle ISP or even

508
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,040
your upstream slightly less valuable as

509
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transit right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to go</font>

510
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,980
everywhere in the world without needing

511
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,410
to tell you but don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send to him</font>

512
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,040
because when you send to him you screw

513
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,900
up my traffic and I can't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is though an option that's there it</font>

516
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,620
a couple of ISPs either with communities

517
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,620
they already had that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,320
try to revert what was done that cannot

524

change of formal relationship where its

contractual based while engineer the

527
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,770
engineer you can agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe those</font>

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,450
te policies don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be there when</font>

paid customers out priority over

533
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,320
non-paid when you talk about a

settlement free interconnect fight

535
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,060
either due to ratio<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems or</font>

contractual problems or<font color="#E5E5E5"> just plain legal</font>

537
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:26,820
problems you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to one of</font>

538
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,490
these solutions because that fights not

539
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,750
going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> done very quickly and as a</font>

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,520
third party

541
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,710
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody's company's going</font>

542
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,180
to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to cert themselves into a</font>

there's there's no return<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that right</font>

545
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:47,580
basically that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all I have for this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

but for fruit based on it was a hit on

me I didn't get out the word in time in

<font color="#E5E5E5">order to grab people up here to have</font>

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,280
questions about what I've covered

553
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:20,809
hi Jay Galle from Newton era I'm curious

554
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:25,450
whether you think of taking out the

555
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:27,830
middleman and trying to locate your

556
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,720
points of<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence closer to your</font>

557
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,928
customers and have fewer of those

558
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:36,590
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP paths between you and the</font>

559
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:39,289
end customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh yes although there's a</font>

560
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:42,678
scale problem with that correct and a

561
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:44,240
deployment problem so as unlike an ISP I

562
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,220
can't deploy a couple routers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

563
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">known data center</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and bring up a pop and</font>

564
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:52,490
I'm right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's a lot more</font>

565
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:55,428
things involved with the CD inside the

566
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,190
house<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if even if we did that</font>

567
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,509
deployment just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you when</font>

568
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,789
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to our company you connect to</font>

569
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,019
our routers and we haul you back you're

00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:05,840
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of capital</font>

571
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:07,190
expenditure and getting into a side of

572
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,320
the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my company doesn't</font>

573
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,860
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into right we're not an ISP</font>

574
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,559
at heart so that specific type of

575
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:20,629
deployment we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it for</font>

576
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:24,668
certain areas especially but yeah that's

577
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:27,590
resistance I've gotten on that thanks

578
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:29,659
Matt p-tech yahoo so one interesting

579
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,939
case that you you didn't mention which

580
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:34,580
sometimes comes into play is whenever

581
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,990
there are disputes between other parties

582
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,049
that may take a long time to resolve

583
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,419
where you are collateral damage as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

584
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:43,100
were saying it can sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

585
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:44,929
create interesting business

586
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,840
opportunities where you can go to a

587
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:49,789
fourth player in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketplace often a</font>

588
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,299
tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> two or somebody that hadn't been</font>

589
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:55,610
considered interesting previously and if

590
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:58,220
they are in a party to have connectivity

591
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,769
to the players in the dispute you can

592
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">often end up shifting your business</font>

593
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:06,110
arrangements around in a way that now

594
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:09,908
leverages their dispute in your favor<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

595
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:14,029
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can start off as an initial</font>

596
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:15,769
challenge for you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

597
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:19,070
in a position where you can leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

598
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:21,529
relationships to offset that by making a

599
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,360
win situation for that new isp so

600
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:24,950
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this with</font>

601
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,799
a

602
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,710
an interesting open mind for it's a

603
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,149
challenge now it's a problem what other

604
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,309
players are there in the marketplace

605
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:36,469
that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can approach that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be also</font>

606
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:38,090
impacted by this where we can gain a

607
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,860
mutual benefit so that's something for

608
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to think about just because it's</font>

609
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,949
a problem now doesn't mean that there

610
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,240
aren't other people affected who may now

611
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:49,279
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with you because of it</font>

612
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,720
right yeah absolutely and as CDN you

613
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,330
also want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking around to see</font>

614
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,539
which ones which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bees are at better</font>

615
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,730
policies better reach there should be a

616
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:00,590
constant RFP process to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

617
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're getting the service you want and</font>

618
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,059
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two companies are constantly</font>

619
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:08,330
having a fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it makes them a</font>

620
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:11,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit less attractive yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes swim</font>

621
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:14,960
wolf oh no scope<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightwave I think you</font>

622
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,230
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix is PC or you need to get</font>

623
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,690
better connectivity to it because

624
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:24,110
traffic engineering is as you said most

625
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:28,039
of the time not<font color="#CCCCCC"> malicious it's needed</font>

626
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:30,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">for some technical reasons and most of</font>

627
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time you can decide where you send</font>

628
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,370
your traffic but how your traffic comes

629
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:38,690
back to you you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> little control over</font>

630
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,889
that that's kind of the point I was

631
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,389
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make traffic engineering</font>

632
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:46,149
absolutely sometimes it's done for a

633
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:48,408
reason some the reason impacts us though

634
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:51,049
we have tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> different different ways</font>

635
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:53,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">of addressing and I'm trying please</font>

636
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:54,440
don't take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as I'm accused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nicepeter</font>

637
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,909
doing something to try to personally

638
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,860
screw me or my company or anything like

639
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:00,470
that that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm getting</font>

640
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,209
at it's just more making aware from a

641
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:05,090
CDN perspective these little shifts

642
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:07,789
which are just day-to-day business for

643
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:11,928
an ISP but that what impact they have on

644
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:15,408
us and some of it is the how quick we're

645
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:19,370
trying to deliver our service if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

646
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:21,289
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not want or did</font>

647
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:24,168
not care quite as much and delivering as

648
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:26,419
quick right for the entire page render

649
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:27,679
then it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

650
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:29,990
leeway we'd be a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more relaxed</font>

651
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,220
about it but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to take the I</font>

652
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,840
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to give the impression this</font>

653
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:36,230
is a confrontational thing between us

654
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,820
and ISPs it absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not that a lot</font>

655
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,850
of the guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I work with coming from</font>

656
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,280
isp so we under

657
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:44,010
what's going on that's why we we call to

658
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,629
try to find out and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a real</font>

659
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,200
reason right there dealing with an issue

660
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:52,350
or they're dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a relationship</font>

661
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,430
change or they're dealing with even they

662
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,219
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in because they're at a ratio</font>

663
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,900
they have shifted over we just want to

664
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,520
get the band reason and then we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

665
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">work with them on what we can do for our</font>

666
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,350
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the deal right yeah I just</font>

667
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:08,219
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the poor customer that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

668
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:11,490
only connected to is bc and it has no

669
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,130
other path to you so I thought your

670
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,740
solution will be s previous said

671
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:23,310
probably to expand more and get closer

672
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:25,470
to your end customers right hi it's andy

673
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">davidson from la nap and i enjoyed the</font>

674
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,880
presentation thank you the one of the I

675
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,760
think I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away messages that I</font>

676
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,920
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that some ISPs do really</font>

677
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,840
care it if you approach them and say we

678
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a mutual customer who and this</font>

679
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,970
needs to be fixed that's something they

680
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:43,409
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear but if those ISPs come by</font>

681
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,500
different ways of reaching your service

682
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,210
from there from from the facility

683
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,630
wherever they're doing their aggregation

684
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:54,420
then then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can they do about it so</font>

685
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,160
my question would be is your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing DB</font>

686
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,920
record up to date and are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning</font>

687
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,570
to build<font color="#CCCCCC"> two more places because if if</font>

688
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,490
you're trying to improve connectivity to

689
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,040
isps that's a really really good way of

690
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,710
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just doing more public</font>

691
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,780
hearing right our pdb records are<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

692
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">date yes I help maintain them and I</font>

693
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,080
handed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off to another engineer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

694
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">now maintaining them we cleaned them up</font>

695
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,840
a little over a year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a half</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and</font>

696
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">got them got them back under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control we</font>

697
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,830
are unfortunately not at a lot of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> exes</font>

698
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,280
right now but as because of the choices

699
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:29,220
of where<font color="#CCCCCC"> our data centers are deployed</font>

700
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,350
but we we do explore and look at them we

701
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,300
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like every other company we have to</font>

702
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,280
show an roi even for an IX connection

703
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,820
because they're all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be either a</font>

704
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,280
metro or long-haul connection but yes we

705
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,590
try to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with ISPs we've announced a</font>

706
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,690
few partnerships to that effect to try

707
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:49,860
to get connections into larger eyes bees

708
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,450
that are essentially settlement free in

709
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,510
order to try to expand our

710
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,760
each but yeah we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing we can</font>

711
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,679
a camel not can't afford but don't want

712
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,059
to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> is buying a transit with</font>
