4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:34,070
that's about as much French as I have so

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:37,270
so this is my second<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog in a row yeah</font>

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,800
and and before that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty years</font>

7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:44,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I'm going to continue to try to space</font>

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,250
it out a little but thanks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,610
leadership team for inviting me to give

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,380
the keynote I see lots of old friends

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,930
everybody looks great maybe a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:57,020
older<font color="#CCCCCC"> but see mr. Norton over here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,970
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> others and so thanks for having me</font>

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,620
it's grown a little bit since I remember

15
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:05,420
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying to to Randy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush that I</font>

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,289
think the last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to there were</font>

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,689
35 people so it's it's a touch larger

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,149
than the last time I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember so with</font>

19
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:17,658
that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

20
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:19,909
of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective and and this is sort</font>

21
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:22,429
of the the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my path in</font>

22
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:25,939
the internet and so left to right I

23
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:28,399
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out working at a small little</font>

24
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:31,398
lab in Frederick Maryland the National

25
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:33,799
cancerous to supercomputer center and my

26
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:37,459
good friend of 27 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kathy Aronson</font>

27
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,979
pointed out back when I had hair so that

28
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,709
was very nice I then moved upstream to

29
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,270
our internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider Soren edge Serena</font>

30
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:47,329
it was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the seven regionals and</font>

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,240
assessment regionals in the mid-90s and

32
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:53,869
and was there for a few years moved up

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,609
to MC i started the nci's internet

34
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,950
business with a handful of folks and

35
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:00,559
then moved on to level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three where again</font>

36
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">kathy pointed out i became a mucky muck</font>

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,729
and I think loosely translated that

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:10,369
means on management so that's me and

39
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll give you a little bit as i was as i</font>

40
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,849
was thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about gosh what am I going</font>

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:18,349
to talk to a room of a thousand people

42
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:20,238
of which 999 are smarter than me it's

43
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,709
kind of daunting you know I'm in

44
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,819
management I don't I don't do a whole

45
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,620
lot of technical thing

46
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,119
is anymore but I was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

47
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">about okay what are the challenges that</font>

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,840
that I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the last 20 or so</font>

49
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:35,120
years and and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that you can sum</font>

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,150
up the challenges at least as I've seen

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,370
them into two buckets technical

52
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,299
challenges the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we see around</font>

53
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,829
scale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and growth and all of the</font>

54
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about with respect</font>

55
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:51,049
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and then the second</font>

56
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:53,389
bucket which are really incentive

57
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,579
challenges and these these are the hard

58
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:58,040
ones you know incentive challenges you

59
00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:01,159
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look in economics there's the</font>

60
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,790
this notion of willing buyer willing

61
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,219
seller everybody heard of that well

62
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:11,448
that's that's actually an example of

63
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:13,189
when incentives align and it's been the

64
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:15,650
case at least for the last many decades

65
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:18,040
and around the internet that it's not

66
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,900
always that are incentives align and

67
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,209
whether that's because of we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

68
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,799
people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have business interests that</font>

69
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,989
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are political</font>

70
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,540
environments that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different you name</font>

71
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,359
it it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the technical ones</font>

72
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,790
I'd actually argue are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of easy the</font>

73
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:39,620
incentive ones are kind of hard and I'll

74
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:42,078
talk a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that so I I</font>

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,970
was I was not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I should go</font>

76
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,259
through history but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

77
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,030
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through a little bit of history</font>

78
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:50,509
because I think it's important I how

79
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:53,449
many newcomers<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 and yeah how many</font>

80
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:57,168
raise your hand yeah so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quarter</font>

81
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:58,430
of the room is newcomers<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old for the</font>

82
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,019
old folks in the room this will be

83
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,629
boring you can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep and wake up</font>

84
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:06,530
later on but I was pointing to pointed

85
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:08,090
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Norton for that we well i'm going to</font>

86
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,590
walk a little bit through a little

87
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:15,650
history and start out with in in 86 I

88
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,668
was in intern at the time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that little</font>

89
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,699
lab and the NSFNET melted down for those

90
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:26,080
that remember it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really did</font>

91
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:30,080
melt down it was unusable during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,698
and and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really smart guy over here</font>

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,099
on the right Dan Jacobson a few other

94
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,560
folks came up with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

100
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,919
what was a fairly decent technical

103
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:08,030
place today is largely<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was built</font>

108
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,520
remember there were a few little

109
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:26,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing and loop</font>

132
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,520
i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this a little</font>

133
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit routers were a big problem way back</font>

134
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,039
when we worried about well how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

packets could just switch switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dennis Ferguson a few others went</font>

off and did a lot of really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Patricia trees and trinary trees</font>

141
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,760
and how to how to do fast lookup and

142
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,230
then the super high capacity OC 48 links

143
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,210
came around and we had to use things

144
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:34,260
like tkm to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to even forward in a</font>

145
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:38,729
box all a technical challenge great work

146
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:44,990
done but largely solved once it was

147
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:48,170
sacked so this part of my job<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember</font>

148
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:51,630
with great kind of trepidation I

149
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:54,510
remember we were off building network

150
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:57,150
back at MCI and we literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> had no idea</font>

151
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,820
how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going to continue to scale</font>

152
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:03,870
our network for months from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point</font>

153
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:06,150
in time no idea we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kinds of</font>

154
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy things we put frame relay switches</font>

155
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,700
in front of routers to aggregate ports

156
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,429
together we built ATM substrates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,719
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offer greater capacity because</font>

158
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't buy a router that would</font>

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,480
actually plug into an OC 12 all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to scale this by the way was was the</font>

162
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,660
point in which many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us were breaking</font>

163
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,849
internet religion by using things like

164
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,599
ATM and frame relay that was thought to

165
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,339
be you know

166
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,149
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess at the time is the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font>

167
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:43,700
I can think of it but when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:46,460
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we built today around mpls and mpls</font>

169

te we largely due to all the same things

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:54,080
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different technology so</font>

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,320
many problems many technical problems

those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were largely fixed</font>

174
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:07,550
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we struggled with some and and</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first is so I've had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

176
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,510
little bit of research here few folks

177
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,660
dave cooper help me help me do some

178
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:18,890
research here around but when did when

179
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,709
did all this ipv6 start 1993 a quarter

180

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet's of the ipv4 address</font>

181
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:29,540
space was actually used at that time so

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,399
it wasn't a lack of foresight<font color="#CCCCCC"> bradner</font>

183
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,589
and mankan and all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks they did</font>

184
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,860
they did great stuff I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally was</font>

185
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,990
a big fan of tuba at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and</font>

UDP over big addresses for those of the

number that one didn't win v6 did so

188
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,989
what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the fact is there</font>

189
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,940
wasn't any real incentive and and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> love</font>

190
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,070
the church I guess Tony hain made this

00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:01,400
chart up here on the right it's from

192
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:04,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nana 27 2002 and and the there's another</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">one going the chart is awesome it talks</font>

194
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:12,709
about early adoption application porting

195
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISP adoption all these things and the</font>

196
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:18,339
only thing that's right on that chart

197
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,870
and no offense to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tony is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the plus sign</font>

198
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:23,180
that's the only thing that we've gotten

199
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,339
right is that it's taken a really long

200
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,729
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why is that well there's no</font>

201
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:34,579
real incentive there wasn't a real

202
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:38,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">incentive to adopt ipv6 and there was a</font>

00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:41,209
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of great work done NAT for instance</font>

204
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,790
to prolong the lights<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifespan and so I</font>

205
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:47,420
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that that the migration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

206
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:53,219
v6 is just because it lacks an intent

207
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:56,010
security I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for vent surf at</font>

208
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,710
MCI and he and I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in this</font>

209
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,450
great debate about the most awesome

210
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,850
thing about the Internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

211
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,390
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that everything's</font>

212
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,460
addressable and when you really get down

213
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest security flaws</font>

214
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,540
that there are in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system it's</font>

215
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of in band signaling and the</font>

216
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,380
fact that everything is addressable and

217
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:22,020
we saw lots and lots of vulnerabilities

218
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,840
at the time TTP Smurf attacks man the

219
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,819
metal all that stuff how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

220
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:32,310
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of 2600 so I'd say so for</font>

221
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,200
those who can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> about half half of</font>

222
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,530
the people in the room so<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the other</font>

223
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:41,340
half that don't know 2600 is the

224
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:45,900
frequency that a captain crunch whistle

225
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:49,340
will blow and it just so turns out that

226
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:52,620
in the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70s the in-band signaling</font>

227
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:56,430
for an eighteen eighty long lines voice

228
00:11:52,620 --> 00:12:01,050
which was a capable of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken over</font>

229
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:03,449
by that tone 2600<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was the sing</font>

called phone phreaking where people

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,190
would essentially take over the trunk

232
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,600

<font color="#E5E5E5">the first examples of hacking and and</font>

237
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,760
it's around the fact that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ban</font>

240
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:33,750
Morris very few so Robert Morris was the

241
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:37,140
author i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is he a cornell student</font>

242
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:41,060
and the author of<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

245
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,430
hack and it was essentially a piece of

software that he had written<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

247
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,660
would go and install itself across all

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,520
this firsthand and got to be interviewed

the FBI and all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff for for</font>

for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so that that was a pretty</font>

254
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,480
interesting time now those

255
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,560
vulnerabilities some of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> still exist</font>

256
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,950
but but when I look at it I say all

257
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:20,069
right what's the incentive whose job is

258
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:24,090
it to fix security the technology has a

259
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:27,810
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an inherent flaw but is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

to fix security interconnection this is

262
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,609
a bit of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm going to try it in</font>

263
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:41,160
that by the way all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these are my own</font>

264
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,900
opinions not those of my company so I

265
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,949
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure I say that first</font>

266
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:51,480
interconnection has and will be a long

267
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,070
problem for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as well as many</font>

called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kingsbury commitment and</font>

274

kingsbury was a judge and at the time

275
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,550
AT&T had to make a commitment to

276

interconnect to all of the phone

277

like meds and and longest exits sure it

281
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,170
is things at all of those things route

282
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:36,840
servers route reflectors all those

283
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:40,050
things were out registries but at times

284
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,570
we ran into incentive problems and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

285
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,520
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was thinking a guy named Scott</font>

286
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:48,810
huddle and I wrote a paper in the 90s

287
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:51,090
around content and whose job was it to

288
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,630
carry content and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in the</font>

289
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,950
paper was war and peace I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

290
00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:01,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about a book a big</font>

291
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,930
voluminous book rather than today a 4k

292
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,120
movie or a you HD movie so the the

293
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,189
dynamic dynamic has changed a little bit

294
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,250
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the incentive problem is still</font>

295
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,250
there

296
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:19,429
so what do we worry about today we worry

297
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:25,069
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool things like space and</font>

298
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:28,039
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you look at the top those</font>

299
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:30,019
are copper cables on the left if you go

300
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,720
into one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our gateways you see that</font>

301
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:37,009
are one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our biggest physical problems</font>

302
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,429
today is the weight of the actual cables

303
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:42,699
that sit up in the trays above the racks

304
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:48,228
because equipment is getting so dense

305
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:51,378
the watts per per gig that the just

306
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:53,359
total power square foot square power per

307
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:54,949
square foot is increasing so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

308
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:57,350
actually getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power to the</font>

309
00:15:54,949 --> 00:16:00,289
equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tough so there's all kinds</font>

310
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,019
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology like 380 volt technology</font>

311
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:04,609
looks really<font color="#E5E5E5"> promising a little bit of a</font>

312
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:08,449
health and safety issue but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

313
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:10,759
probably over overcome that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

314
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:15,529
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something we worry a lot</font>

315
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:17,149
today about so fiber I don't know as

316
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:21,229
anybody ever come to nanigen talked

317
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:22,850
about fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right I thought I</font>

318
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I was hoping I was going to be one</font>

319
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:30,979
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first so so fiber it's a really</font>

320
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:35,269
integral part of all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do right</font>

321
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:37,609
and and in the 90s actually in the 80s

322
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:39,589
when fiber technology was first being

323
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:43,309
deployed it was direct buried into the

324
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:45,499
ground probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest technology</font>

325
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:47,509
advancement in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 90s was putting</font>

326
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:49,609
plastic pipes in the ground so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

327
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:52,609
actually pull more fiber not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

328
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:53,989
revolutionary<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you'd be surprised how</font>

329
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:58,909
much fiber is actually in the ground

330
00:16:53,989 --> 00:17:01,609
that's not in conduit if you looked at

331
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:04,240
fiber in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early 90s it was</font>

332
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:07,549
drawn from this thing called a preform

333
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,049
if you if you actually had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fiber he</font>

334
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:10,819
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little problem because the way it</font>

335
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:13,519
was drawing it wasn't perfectly round

336
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,220
and it had<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kinds of impairments</font>

337
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,549
because of that post 94 there's lots of

338
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,339
new fiber and and technology like non

339
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:24,060
zero dispersion shifted cyber came into

340
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,500
play and when we were

341
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,889
start in our company we thought well

342
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">geez we've seen one generation one new</font>

343
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:35,430
generation of fiber already in 10 years

344
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,590
what happens if there are more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

345
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:42,710
fibers hence the or more more fiber

346
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:45,510
technology hence the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plastic pipes so</font>

347
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:48,380
here's what's happened in the last 15

348
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:50,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">years for from 2002 2015</font>

349
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">state-of-the-art in two thousand was a</font>

350
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,440
fiber called leaf it<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically was a</font>

351
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,110
large effective area fiber is better

352
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,350
than SMF because all sports all sorts of

353
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:04,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like the dispersion compensation</font>

354
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:06,840
and what's happened is that electronics

355
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,150
have caught up and now we use things

356
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,740
like special modulation and special

357
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:15,930
detection to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to get rid of</font>

358
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,910
the impairments in fiber what we've

359
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,530
really done though what we've seen is

360
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,890
that fiber loss has improved

361
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:25,320
dramatically the the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> size of</font>

362
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,820
fiber has improved and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look over</font>

363
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:32,220
there on the right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of small</font>

364
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:35,159
but it 98 are our fiber was about point

365
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,040
25 DB per kilometer today it's about

366
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:42,030
point 17 which is about a forty percent

367
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,770
improvement in Los so when we use new

368
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,460
fiber today we will use this type of

369
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:51,090
fiber bigger core all that means is that

370
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:55,020
things like 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gig things like 200 gig</font>

371
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:57,629
400 gig when you actually go in and and

372
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:01,620
and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that technology you're</font>

373
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:07,650
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this type of fiber oops</font>

374
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:10,590
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 gig hey so you see the</font>

375
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,120
picture that that's storing a

376
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,520
maintenance by the way that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not how it</font>

377
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,879
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks every day in case you're</font>

378
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:27,440
one of our customers

379
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:31,910
I promise<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we got great at ecmp and</font>

380
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:35,180
lag and today we have you know hundred

381
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:39,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten gig links between cities in our in</font>

382
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:42,290
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT backbone it's gotten pretty</font>

383
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,780
difficult and things like a hundred gig

384
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,930
you know we we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky in this</font>

385
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:51,800
last step in technology in telecom it

386
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:55,040
used to be you know OC 3 20 c 12 OCT 12

387
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:58,850
20 c48 OC forty eight to 10 gig all kind

388
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,610
of 4x jumps in in in technology and

389
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:05,060
capacity today we're experienced a 10x

390
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:08,179
jump which is awesome so when you look

391
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:11,419
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fiber tray there that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

392
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:14,930
result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hundreds of 10 gig links</font>

393
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,090
hopefully in a reduction by 10 and we

394
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that 200 and 400 gig is pretty</font>

395
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,899
much on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> horizon still got some</font>

396
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,530
issues around reach but but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

397
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,090
excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and so is our fiber 3</font>

398
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:31,850
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> our fiber trade vendors</font>

399
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:34,310
probably not very happy about it so we

400
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't worry a lot about this anymore I</font>

401
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">what as I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we spent a lot of</font>

402
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,960
time worrying about how do we grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:46,960
network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> four months from now 20</font>

404
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:49,970
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago today we have tons of tricks</font>

405
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">3-stage cost matrix it's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

406
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,980
we as well as many other folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

407
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,470
built all because we need more fan out

408
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so these types of architectures are</font>

409
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,070
ones that let you have more fan outs

410
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,040
pine leaf is another another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one a</font>

411
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit other arguments for that but</font>

412
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,800
frankly between the two we don't worry a

413
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,660
lot about how to scale the

414
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,300
infrastructure from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective</font>

415
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:19,040
from an actual box perspective here's

416
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:22,040
what I do worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is it's</font>

417
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,470
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see on the on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand side</font>

418
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the chart here but if you just follow</font>

419
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,230
the color so blue is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route is router</font>

420
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,669
capacity

421
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:39,350
and orange is transporter WDM capacity

422
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:42,799
and in 98 routers generally speaking

423
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:48,199
gross generalization were much much less

424
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:50,870
dense than WDM here so play that forward

425
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,880
that that's that's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8x difference by</font>

426
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,668
the way play<font color="#CCCCCC"> that forward through the</font>

427
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,030
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about two thousand thirteen</font>

428
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:03,260
or so suddenly routers are becoming much

429
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:06,500
more dense than W DM gear and today this

430
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">is there are many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> w Kiba and</font>

431
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,650
vendors that are here in this room

432
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:13,370
they're going to tackle me when I leave

433
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:15,410
just relax I'm sure somebody's got some

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">guide box that's coming that is much</font>

435
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,960
bigger than a terabit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but generally</font>

436
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:24,590
speaking we know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> market today</font>

437
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,960
routers are much much more dense than W

438
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,740
vm here so think now we don't worry a

439
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,940
lot about it we have a ton<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fiber but</font>

440
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,250
the industry is going to have to worry

441
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it because we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

442
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,600
to buy these incredibly dense routers

443
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,850
and yet we're still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

444
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,549
slap and slap<font color="#E5E5E5"> them together with much</font>

445
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:46,939
much less dense<font color="#CCCCCC"> WDM gear which i think</font>

446
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:48,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">will become a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us control an</font>

449
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,049

450
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,600
I said it actually I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

451
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:03,230
about sdn I care a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about automation</font>

452
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,990
of control getting less and less human

453
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,669
touch to our network you know we have

454
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,700
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of

455
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:13,250
devices and managing them is difficult

456
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,700
and so the more and more automation that

457
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,710
we can get will help us be be better we

458
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,410
do think that nfe has some interesting

459
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,570
things but frankly we're still a little

460
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,570
bit questioning some of the economics

461
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,850
interconnection so today what do we

462
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,250
worry about today about interconnexion

463
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,990
hey we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the awesome US open</font>

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet order I know everyone in the</font>

466
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:48,850
no okay well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would I give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you my</font>

467
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:51,639
opinion I think we needed some help and

468
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,899
I don't love<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll always love this kind</font>

469
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:55,029
of help but I think we needed some help

470
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:57,399
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some help we'll see how that</font>

471
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:59,409
plays out there is another internet

472
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:03,580
order right now being reviewed in the

473
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">EoE you will see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens the</font>

474
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,049
dynamics appearing are definitely

475
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:12,460
changing there's there's no question and

476
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:14,139
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more press about it I</font>

477
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,909
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to someone last night</font>

478
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:18,279
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that that you know it's</font>

479
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:21,399
hit mainstream when John Oliver can do

480
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:26,139
eight an awesome explanation of of the

481
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:30,549
issue around around net neutrality we

482
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:33,789
have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways to measure ratios bit</font>

483
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:35,590
miles longest eggs at all there are a

484
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:37,960
bunch of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to deal with inter</font>

485
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:42,928
connection but but frankly I'd say that

486
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">even today interconnection still suffers</font>

487
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:48,429
maybe not as much in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US but</font>

488
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,019
certainly around the world and again

489
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:51,789
back to incentives what are the

490
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:56,730
incentives for us to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> interconnection</font>

491
00:24:51,789 --> 00:25:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the long run I'm security you know</font>

492
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:07,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone from the exuberant geek to</font>

493
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:09,250
actually business and you know organized

494
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,379
crime nation-states you guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:15,610
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this you can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually</font>

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,590
buy a botnet a botnet using your

498
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,840
you'd like and you can go attack whoever

499
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:27,129
you want and it's very automated it's

500
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,260
really nice it turns out that it's

501
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,130
gotten kind of mainstream and if you

502
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:36,700
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a step back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and think what happens</font>

503
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:38,710
when this sort of Internet of Things 50

504
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,210
billion hundred billion devices is

505
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:45,070
actually connected and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes the</font>

506
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,460
footprint in which we need to worry

507
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:52,570
about security it's a fairly big problem

508
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,530
i think headed for us again though whose

509
00:25:52,570 --> 00:26:01,389
job is it

510
00:25:53,530 --> 00:26:05,110
sit what's the incentive v4 we all know

511
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:08,770
Aaron's out of addresses there's a

512
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:11,500
growing secondary market for ipv4 we'll

513
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:13,930
see what happens there adoption is

514
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,750
beginning to happen you know I i would

515
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,820
say hats off to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cable folks and</font>

516
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,890
and and mobile operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they've</font>

517
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,220
done a really fabulous job with adoption

518
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:26,530
of v6 so we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it</font>

519
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:30,130
traffic has grown a hundred percent for

520
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:32,860
us and in the last year still a barrier

521
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,560
still frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I questioned what the</font>

522
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,270
incentive really is I mean Frank went

523
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,310
when we run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the dresses that'll</font>

524
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,389
be a when you really can't get any

525
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,669
dresses that will be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimate</font>

526
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,460
incentive but we still will struggle a

527
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,590
little bit but I do think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

528
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,980
good progress facebook said that fifty

529
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:57,340
percent of all mobile devices are

530
00:26:49,980 --> 00:27:00,310
delivered over ipv6 now so our industry

531
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:03,340
continues to solve the technology

532
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:06,220
challenges and as a technology guy I I

533
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,010
always love it when I hear we're about

534
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:13,240
ready to hit the laws of<font color="#E5E5E5"> physics or</font>

other engineering technical things that

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,570
people will say that we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ready to run out and and the great thing</font>

about about technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we almost</font>

always figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a way and and if you</font>

545
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,370
bet against it but what i worry about

for the future it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

548
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:52,810
statement in the world is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

you might say well yeah no kidding just

553
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">17 years ago i sat in a conference room</font>

myself one out there's no time down here

563

so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not picking a date I'm not coming</font>

00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:47,600
it and I'm not saying whether it's

566
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:51,449
public or private because i'm not sure i

567
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,100
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could all be public the</font>

568
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,350
question is whether we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can fix all the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I was struck by your list I agree with</font>

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,740
all of them you got down to the bottom

<font color="#E5E5E5">and said but this is a hard problem</font>

whose job is it to fix it help where do

584
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:10,690
you see the engineering communities role

585
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:13,000
in establishing standards when the

586
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:18,760
incentives that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have rightly noted</font>

587
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,600
are not there how do the people who see

588
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:25,510
an engineering solution get wheels under

589
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,469
it under the financial and legal and

590

592
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:39,900
the answer other than I'd say it it'll

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:45,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably just take a few more home depot</font>

596
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,620
have to deal with this what we've done

597
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,450
from our company's perspective is we

598
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have a committee on our board</font>

599
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,070
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> directors that focuses and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

600
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:02,230
security and where we invest and how

601
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,178
we're protecting ourselves and the

602
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,700
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and services that were that</font>

604
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:13,030
compliance so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first answer</font>

605
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:15,730
is awareness and if you're in a company

606
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,789
I'd encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that that awareness is</font>

607
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:23,919
a huge gap and companies really<font color="#E5E5E5"> struggle</font>

608
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:26,080
with it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going for broke here you</font>

someone at the left hi my name is

618
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,769
jacques letoure I'm the CTO for da ta

619
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,929
and like you know CTO you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

620
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:07,149
a vision of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future and where we want</font>

621
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:11,799
to be and all that and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

622
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">driving me nuts is ipv4 it's done right</font>

623
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:17,889
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to set a date collectively when</font>

624
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:21,158
we shut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off I can't go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on forever we</font>

625
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:24,490
need to go to v6 and if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wave</font>

626
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:27,070
it wait for it to die naturally it will

627
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:30,760
never die naturally naturally so we have

628
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,529
to pick a date<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make it happen so</font>

629
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,629
what's your thought on that I know it's

630
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:37,120
been people here want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep by TV for</font>

631
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:41,380
forever I don't know why but we need to

632
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,979
move on I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

633
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:48,580
completely agree i think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

634
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:52,179
have will have both for izle at least as

635
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:54,129
long as I'm breathing so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

636
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:56,200
it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

637
00:32:54,130 --> 00:33:02,019
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flag day in which we turn off</font>

638
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:04,720
the v4 address space but I do think that

639
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:09,370
that scarcity is going to become the

640
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest issue will become I don't know</font>

641
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,389
if I think that there's ever going to be

642
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:16,269
a day where where I believe that we shut

643
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:19,750
off before personally all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

you dr. Sandra Mike Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> temkin Netflix</font>

645
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:26,529
so if you look back to when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

646
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:28,510
you really could look at the u.s. is the

647
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">quote unquote center of the internet</font>

648
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,260
right and back through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

649
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,350
permutations and iterations that we've

650
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,580
had now we're in a world where we have

651
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,530
grown<font color="#E5E5E5"> in globalization you've got</font>

652
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,439
submarine cables that are being built

653
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:44,350
the express purpose of bypassing the US

654
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,450
and so how do you think that that

655
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,270
impacts the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 business and the</font>

00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:51,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet as a whole as we get taken out</font>

00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,310
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> more or less the hub if you will of</font>

658
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,050
the internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it truly becomes a</font>

global network with China and<font color="#E5E5E5"> India</font>

660
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:01,300
actively participating yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean and</font>

661
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,400
this is this is frankly exactly why we

662
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,100
have our committee on our board of

663
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,139
directors and and you might say well how

664
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,120
the hell is that connected that the

665
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:15,299
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't act as a US</font>

666
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:18,940
company we operate in 100 countries

667
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,790
around the world and we have to we have

668
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,418
to abide by local law and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

669
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:28,060
everything from information<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection</font>

670
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:30,489
22 you know all the subpoena rights and

671
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:33,969
takedown rights and all those things we

672
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:35,799
have to operate in each country as if

673
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:39,839
you know that's where we got our license

674
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:42,580
and so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had to change our</font>

675
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,100
thinking as a management team as to how

676
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,699
we operate and become much much<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

677
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">centric and and more more global you</font>

678
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:53,469
know it's it's tough right because I

679
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:56,380
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like the inter</font>

680
00:34:53,469 --> 00:35:01,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">connection rules we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some promise</font>

681
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:03,310
that that are some probability that that

682
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,620
the interconnection rules in the u.s.

683
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,960
might look similar to what they look to

684
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,380
the EU<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stops there</font>

685
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,380
and there are so many different

686
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">incentive challenges back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in in</font>

687
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,620
different parts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world where</font>

688
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,720
governments are protecting their PT

689
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:23,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">tease or there are different ownership</font>

690
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,810
rights where I mean we don't own our own

691
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,360
network in in China for exactly this

692
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,009
reason because you know we we struggle

693
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,690
with ownership and putting money in the

694
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:35,050
ground and not not being able to get it

695
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:37,000
back out so we we really struggle with

696
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:41,190
some parts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world right now but</font>

697
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,980
it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> question please by there i</font>

I think that we're reaching the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

709
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,410
where where the the law of<font color="#E5E5E5"> large numbers</font>

710
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,480
takes over for any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tweak we can</font>

711
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,549
do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> class the address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> space and all</font>

712
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,780
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's that's on the</font>

713
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:27,960
margin if there really are 50 billion

715
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,579
that all need to be reachable I don't

716
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">think any of those proposals I mean</font>

717
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:37,230
they're they're fine work around or find

718
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:39,270
things to add on some life but but I

719
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:42,329
think if you really believe that there

720
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,809
are that many devices coming and I

721
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:49,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally do i think it's it's horses</font>

722
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:55,230
out of the barn then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think all those</font>

723
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:57,599
are kind of at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the margin thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff</font>

726
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:03,960
last 30-odd years when both of us

started<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem was the telcos and</font>

728
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,579
the answer realistically was this

729
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:11,400
end-to-end architecture that pushed

730
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:14,809
control functionality and value out of

731
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,730
the network across into the end systems

732
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:22,230
yet you're working for a carriage

733
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:26,270
company and somehow the telcos refused

734
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:28,589
to die they continue to try and pack

735
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:31,890
complexity and what they think is value

736
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:34,920
into the network despite the end systems

737
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:36,900
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it looks like carriages</font>

738
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problem still and we still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

739
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:42,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite got over it what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

740
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,379
about your future in your carriage

741
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,430
business are you willing to embrace

742
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,260
commoditization or do you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

743
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,540
there's a dollar to be squeezed out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

744
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:55,430
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> bids well I hope there is for at</font>

745
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,430
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten more years 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

746
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,550
you know and so I struggle with a little

747
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of that as you probably know because</font>

748
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do think at least from our perspective</font>

749
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,370
we aren't a carriage company and we

750
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:15,190
didn't start with a hundred years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

751
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:16,569
government grant of monopoly so you know

752
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:21,100
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started the old-fashioned way a</font>

753
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:23,500
dollar at a time and and with the focus

754
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,589
around building something that had long

755
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,600
long long optionality and so from the

756
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:31,360
plastic pipes in the ground to the fiber

757
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:34,299
to to looking at technology in a very

758
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,550
different way I mean we we thought I

759
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,180
mean we were called crazy and I know

760
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,100
it's it's a it seems silly to say now

761
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,799
but we build a network and a company

762
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:47,230
completely optimized around<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

763
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,270
technology I mean today everybody to go

764
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,190
no crap yeah i mean that's that's what

765
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:54,430
you would do but back then that was

766
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:56,410
unheard of so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think at least from my</font>

767
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,290
perspective we we've approached it very

768
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:01,270
differently it you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get me on</font>

769
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a rant around the cloud right</font>

770
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,960
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are like raindrops in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

771
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,420
crowd right there's stuff inside the

772
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,490
cloud and and we're the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and many</font>

773
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,580
of us in the room are the stuff inside

774
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:15,669
the cloud so I I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> carriage is</font>

775
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:18,610
incredibly important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get from the end</font>

776
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:23,440
systems and and you could argue whether

777
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:25,450
the value exchange has been exactly I'm

778
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,530
a free market guy so the value exchange

779
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:31,359
is what the market will bear but I very

780
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,670
much believe that carriage is important

781
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:38,290
and will continue to be important thank

782
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:40,720
you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul's ignoring from LinkedIn you</font>

783
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:42,910
mentioned security and usually in the

784
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,350
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cyber attacks how about the</font>

785
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:48,819
fire but that's been getting cut in the

786
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. in 2015 yeah I mean obviously it</font>

787
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,600
for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have been reading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

788
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,430
paper we as well as many others have

789
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,460
suffered a little bit on the vandalism

790
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,259
side especially in Northern California

791
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,380
its public there are parts that we can't

792
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:05,430
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about but you know I think think</font>

793
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:09,119
part of the ability of the of the

794
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:11,839
of the system is the fact that we can't

795
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,420
have the armed<font color="#E5E5E5"> guards running around</font>

796
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,599
186,000 miles of fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there</font>

797
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,010
there is there is some natural

798
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,530
vulnerability to physical infrastructure

799
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:25,740
you know we work hard at trying to

800
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:28,380
protect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually you can't if there</font>

801
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:32,520
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad people that you can't you can't</font>

802
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:35,550
do a lot about that but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

803
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,849
it's a testament to the survivability of

804
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:40,859
the technology and and the fact that

805
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:44,760
we've you know suffered as you mentioned

806
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:47,400
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things we still you know</font>

807
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,000
service has has if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the total</font>

808
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,040
system has largely been<font color="#CCCCCC"> resilient and so</font>

809
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,599
it's a concern it's a concern there's no

810
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,180
question and frankly there are harder

811
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,000
parts to operate go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> Latin America</font>

812
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,558
and and not not because of vandalism but

813
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,020
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just construction and</font>

814
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:08,210
economic development it's a tough<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

815
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,210
to operate so so we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot a</font>

816
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:19,339
more last questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay listen thank</font>

817
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a great week</font>
