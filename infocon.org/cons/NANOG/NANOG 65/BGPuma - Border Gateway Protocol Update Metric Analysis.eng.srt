00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,869
rmr our last speaker for this session is

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,420
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Metcalfe from cert at</font>

4
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:23,450
CMU she'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about both the</font>

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,890
silk tool suite which which are an

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,650
excellent way of looking at traffic data

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,880
as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> how potentially they can be</font>

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,060
adapted for<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at routing</font>

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,060
information

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,550
so high thanks i'm lee<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metcalf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,460
actually am a researcher these days but

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">at one point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was operational I</font>

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,640
actually do not miss being paged at

14
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:56,030
three in the morning and so I'm very

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to be a research person now so my</font>

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,579
research I mean I have as much data as I

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,210
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my hands on cert has a mirror</font>

18
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:08,080
for both ripe routing data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralph</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

19
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:12,800
routing data it's a very available at

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">rob used a schmear org and I hope have</font>

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,800
that right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway I have all this</font>

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,020
data and so one day my ball<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-worker</font>

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,060
said how do I find things in it and

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,509
that's how this came about first of all

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,009
I'd like to say I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> name this okay</font>

26
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,840
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not me that was Rachel cart</font>

27
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:32,899
chief Rachel's in the room hi Rachel in

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,250
the back yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't name this nor did</font>

29
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:35,659
I came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a background that was</font>

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,210
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-worker I just write the</font>

31
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,679
software so then we have lots of

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,419
legalese everyone can pretend they saw

33
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:45,920
so the statement of the problem was well

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,600
team or came into my office one day and

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,340
said I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> these cider blocks I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">know all routing announcements</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

37
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,880
could affected them and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

38
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it soon can you do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast so if</font>

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,710
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just matches then that's a</font>

40
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP dump piped into a gruff and I'm done</font>

41
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,899
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> he wanted the subnets and the super</font>

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,470
nets that could have affected I think

43
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">its last 24 at the time and I said okay</font>

44
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:21,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do this luckily I</font>

45
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,640
work with a lot of suck very smart

46
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,250
software engineers who have written this

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,720
tool suite called silk and I combined

48
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:33,560
silk with<font color="#E5E5E5"> riped bgp dump and i made BG</font>

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:36,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">fuma so first let's talk a little bit</font>

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,810
about silk silk is mentioned yesterday

51
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,890
silk is really designed for security but

52
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,410
doesn't have to be just used for

53
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,929
security it is incredibly fast it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

54
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,810
designed with UNIX file system in mind

55
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,650
so when it stores files it wants to use

56
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,650
your directories

57
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:01,220
and it's available on that the URL at

58
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:05,260
tools it supports collecting storage

59
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,060
analysis and it works with IP fix and

60
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,950
there's also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> python plug in pi silk</font>

61
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,140
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i promised i would mention it so</font>

62
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,910
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go and it has lots of</font>

63
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:22,250
documentation and did<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mention it's</font>

64
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:26,000
really fast the one I had this 39 gig

65
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:29,210
pcap file and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,490
many flows were in that peek at so I

67
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,160
started a TCP dump because when i see

68
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:37,310
pcap I think TCP dump<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let's see how</font>

69
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,120
long it takes hours and hours and hours

70
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,980
later I finally got a number well the

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,860
guys I work with said why didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

72
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,140
silk so I use silk and silk has two

73
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,020
tools one of them is called I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

74
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,529
going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it it's RW p2y afto</font>

75
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,630
silk which takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pcap files turns it</font>

76
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,709
into silk files and then I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

77
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:05,180
silk commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually run it it did</font>

78
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:06,709
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in three minutes so I was hours and</font>

79
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,420
hours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's even with using all the</font>

80
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,030
TCP dump commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> that say don't look</font>

81
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,799
things up just give me the raw stuff

82
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:17,480
versus three minutes I want okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

83
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,090
sold you guys are great beyond its basic

84
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,110
abilities restoring network data silk

85
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:26,510
has IP sets and these are optimized

86
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,570
actually for cider box but being me I

87
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,520
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to test and see exactly how fast and</font>

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,280
how strong they are because while I'm a

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,320
researcher if someone tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 is</font>

90
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,119
everywhere well then I go write a blog

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,340
post which I did about two years ago for

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:45,200
shirt that says well yeah it is trending

93
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:48,460
upwards but it's not everywhere so I

94
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,380
took a bunch of our sets i created one I

95
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,570
took every odd IP address in the

96
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:57,200
internet and yes this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strange</font>

97
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,030
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be taking and I took every even</font>

98
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,120
IP address such I'm sure no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

99
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,609
has ever used ever if you have please

100
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,189
let me know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know why</font>

101
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,020
and I did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I looked at how</font>

102
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">silk work with sets and I said this is</font>

103
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,068
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolute worst case scenario</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

104
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,080
silk this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be pathetically</font>

105
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:20,840
slow not really it's still pretty fast

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,969
and it works in seconds to compare all

107
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,138
of those guys but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really designed</font>

108
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:31,699
for cyber bucks so that's what I use for

109
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:33,590
BG<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pema and it is the sux are available</font>

110
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,300
by themselves you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to install</font>

111
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,909
all of silk if you just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

112
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:43,580
sets I actually have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short blog post</font>

113
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:46,729
out which it's how to save md5 s as ipv6

114
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,599
sets because they're both basically the

115
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:53,628
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> sized ones got Colin's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wayland ez'n</font>

116
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:57,438
and you can save in store and search md5

117
00:05:53,629 --> 00:06:01,069
s very fast with it now on the other

118
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,379
hand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use this as silk has lib silk</font>

119
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,840
which is a library<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was designed for</font>

120
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,580
it and it allows you access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

121
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">the silk functionality so if you</font>

122
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,680
download still can you say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font>

123
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,089
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools work but I kind of</font>

124
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,940
like the way it does some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

125
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:19,729
well you can just write your own version

126
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,349
and my co workers laughed at me when I

127
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,150
put the slide in here but I've worked

128
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:26,500
with an awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of libraries that an</font>

129
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:29,989
awful lot of horribly documented code

130
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,900
this code is amazingly documented the

131
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,580
lead doc the lead programmer finds it

132
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,750
offensive that everyone else doesn't do

133
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,240
that the same way he does yeah it's a

134
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">little funny but he documents everything</font>

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,930
is not just the case at the top of the

136
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,879
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can read this and say this is</font>

137
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,039
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is in this file he also</font>

138
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,360
documents how the things work with in

139
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,909
there so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to know how</font>

140
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,189
I silk I psets work you can download the

141
00:06:52,909 --> 00:07:00,169
code look at it and go that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> how mark</font>

142
00:06:55,189 --> 00:07:03,490
made I psets work so bgp dump is a

143
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:06,198
library written by and supported by ripe

144
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,939
it includes a library in a program for

145
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,409
managing the you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp update</font>

146
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:15,620
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr TG zebra update and so BG puma</font>

147
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:18,360
is basically the child of the two of

148
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">them i took lib silk I took Luigi's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pump</font>

149
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,610
I put a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> C++ in the middle and I</font>

150
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:28,128
got VG FEMA and if you want to ask me

151
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:30,389
why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> C++ I'll tell you I'm lazy</font>

152
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:36,650
that's my former assistant many years

153
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:39,870
talking so so how does vgp PMO work well

154
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:42,000
you give it a list of update files you

155
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,250
give it a list of cider box or<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefixes</font>

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,229
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you want to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them and</font>

157
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:49,169
you run it just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you say BG</font>

158
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:51,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Puma dash files file containing the list</font>

159
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:54,930
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the files and then you have a</font>

160
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,840
list of all the prefixes and it prints

161
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,969
out an output for example i occasionally

162
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,128
look and see who's announcing private IP

163
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:05,490
space or non-routable whatever you want

164
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:08,939
to call it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I get out</font>

165
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:11,279
it's basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same output is bgp</font>

166
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:14,069
dump it's just filtered down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vet</font>

167
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,210
box that I'm interested in so on the

168
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:23,159
first line that found a / 32 in 10 and

169
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:26,039
the second one it found a / 24 and also

170
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:28,169
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have all the data it also</font>

171
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,860
understands the directory structure for

172
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:34,348
both route and ripe views excuse me ripe

173
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,560
and route views and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said</font>

174
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have all the data so i am lazy and</font>

175
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't want to spend all my time making</font>

176
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,149
list of files to go search through so i

177
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,699
made it understand the directory

178
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure so if you have some way of</font>

179
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:49,649
what remote mounting these in whatever

180
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,979
fashion<font color="#E5E5E5"> i personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use sshfs because</font>

181
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:55,800
we'll have ssh access you can run VG

182
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">Puma on days and it will be happy to do</font>

183
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,949
so it understands what each of those are

184
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:06,209
supposed to look like and so there's the

185
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:08,910
output for an extended run and the

186
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,439
output is explained it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

187
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,449
documentation exactly what it looks like

188
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the timestamp throughout mounts</font>

189
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:16,859
metallocene an announcement or

190
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,870
withdrawal the source IP the source asn

191
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,079
the destination IP in the destination is

192
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:25,890
n the cider block and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> an announcement</font>

193
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:28,099
the actual path so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> this comes up</font>

194
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:31,430
occasionally well more than occasionally

195
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lee they want to know why this one</font>

196
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,410
then go check the routing for me and so

197
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,060
I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and run and see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

198
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,240
DoD that no one's supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

199
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,250
announcing yes someone did and they

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced this last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 in it but it's a</font>

201
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,390
typo because you can just look at it and

202
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:52,100
go oh yeah that's you know one off from

203
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:55,610
theirs they're missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one it will</font>

204
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,260
also look for autonomous systems so that

205
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,850
if you want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what any</font>

206
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,060
announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that contain in your</font>

207
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,709
autonomous systems it will do those and

208
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,510
it will do both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them at the same time</font>

209
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:08,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">as then you'll say this autonomous</font>

210
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:12,459
system and this prefix or you can give

211
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:15,020
the infamous<font color="#E5E5E5"> or flag and I'll do or and</font>

212
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,130
there's some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> options basically if</font>

213
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,640
you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> your output to go to</font>

214
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:22,970
standard out it will dump it into a file

215
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:27,050
and there's help fought there's a help I

216
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">even gave help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and verbose now speed</font>

217
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,170
this is the part which really makes the

218
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,360
Jeep Yuma happy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I picked today</font>

219
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Randy day and said give me the largest</font>

220
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,959
file that showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on this random day</font>

221
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:44,660
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 40 Meg file and so bgp jump</font>

222
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:49,819
on average took 39 seconds to go through

223
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:53,029
it BG kuma<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 3.4 seconds well excuse me</font>

224
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:58,520
50 3.8 seconds so about 14 seconds more

225
00:10:53,029 --> 00:11:02,150
I did an entire day in five minutes and

226
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,380
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picked today at random I didn't</font>

227
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,540
actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sides the day or</font>

that they're currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's dumped out</font>

231
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,959
everything when pearl the reason I'm

232
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,180
bringing it here is because personally

233
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm happy if it dumps out everything</font>

234
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,410
that makes me happy because then I can

235
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,480
you know use other lovely unix command

236
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,719
tools sort off whatever and give me a

237
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,420
nice little summary but that's me and

238

would really like to know so that i can

241
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,529
improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that other people can use</font>

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,720

are not you know me
