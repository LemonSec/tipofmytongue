respecting the routing policies

164
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,380
filtering a prefix means the prefix is

165
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,270
not installed in the forwarding table

166
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,669
and the prefix is not announced to

167
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,260
neighbor asses with filtering we have a

168
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:38,930
concern about<font color="#E5E5E5"> creation of black holes</font>

a router that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a matching</font>

the packet will be dropped now dragon

provably does not create black holes

174
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,680
moreover the filtering strategy must

175
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,750
align with the incentives of<font color="#CCCCCC"> da SS and</font>

provide a baseline of understanding for

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,000
how network operators set their policies

and these policies are based on just

three attributes the rod can be learned

stages let's have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

filter<font color="#CCCCCC"> Q if they apply the filtering</font>

341
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:26,890
code let's suppose that a s4 does apply

342
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:29,370
the filtering code then s 4 s 4 filters

343
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,650
it does not send the route to a s2 so

344
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">s2 now resorts to the pier out that it</font>

consistent s2 is in a worse position now

347
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,540
but a stew now is a double incentive to

348
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,599
filter as well on filtering<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's save on</font>

349
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,370
forwarding state and it reverts to

350
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,610
sending data packets to a customer

351
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather than to appear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if as2 filters</font>

352
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:59,430
as well it goes the packets go downwards

353
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:01,830
in this line moreover it's possible to

354
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,719
choose which notes the or an ordering

355
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,670
for for the notes to filter that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

the flow of packets is the same and then

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,829
among those that elect a customer out

then the four packets remains the same

for the same routing policies for which

more fundamentally solid framework to

for my eyes crime so from my perspective

00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:35,980
if you're an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end point on the internet</font>

523
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:43,210
this should work as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> described but if</font>

524
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,480
you're providing transit you end up with

525
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">a problem where if you're not announcing</font>

526
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,020
a more specific route to to a customer

527
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:55,299
of yours and your competitor is because

528
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,000
you know it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in their case they</font>

529
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:59,559
see different different paths your

530
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,750
competitor is going to take that traffic

531
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:06,970
and not you so it seems like because bgp

532
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,510
always will pick the most specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

533
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,220
the ultimate rule breaker something

534
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:18,250
would need to to break that mechanism

535
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:19,510
also right so if you are not announcing

536
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,399
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific to one of your</font>

537
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,929
customers and the other provider is

538
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:24,908
announcing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic will go that</font>

539
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,890
way but then the customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> argue</font>

540
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:29,260
also have an incentive to filter as well

541
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:33,220
and spread or balance the traffic both

542
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:37,570
ways that is one of our our arguments

543
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:40,240
here yeah that<font color="#E5E5E5"> requires a lot of micro</font>

544
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:42,220
policies around the internet though that

545
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,049
mean it would need to be automated for

546
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:52,450
you know for everyone to really take

547
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:54,399
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so okay Matt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PTAC yahoo I know</font>

548
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,710
I'm pretty dumb so I'm just a little

549
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:59,110
slow on this but when you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

550
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,570
about the aggregated route generation

551
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:06,029
you had three AAS is at the bottom all

552
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:10,080
feeding up into a s3 and then as2 was

553
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:15,039
magically generating an aggregated route

554
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:18,158
p can you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me understand what</font>

555
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS path would look like on that</font>

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:24,190
route coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that p grout that's</font>

557
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,979
generated why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it generate the pirata</font>

558
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,730
no I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking what would the a s path</font>

559
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,400
look like wood a s

560
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,730
to simply state that it was the origin

561
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,940
would a s to claim that three was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

562
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:41,059
origin what a s number would show up as

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that peer out well the</font>

564
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:49,610
origin would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be SAS 3 so a s2 would be</font>

565
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:52,460
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world hey as3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has this route</font>

566
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:56,570
even though as3 doesn't think it has

567
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,190
that route well s3 will function here as

568
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,389
a beacon it is not creating new address

569
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,520
space I mean you are right on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your comment but a squeeze function</font>

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,960
creating address space but it's true

I suspect that you might find ISPs are a

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:22,460
little concerned if somebody else tells

think the idea of speaking up for

just to what you might speak a little

I just like to for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

594
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:20,080
that in South America because our a

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:26,240
symmetric traffic way to receive traffic

596
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:29,570
we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a lot the more specific</font>

602
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:57,379
 try to make some kind of reverse

603
00:27:51,950 --> 00:28:01,190
path traffic control so in this way my

604
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:08,720
question to you is did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you analyze the</font>

605
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:12,940
the possibility when dealing with not

606
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:21,790
with internal routing information only

607
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:27,020
but the way that the the advertised from

608
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:34,159
from an orangey<font color="#E5E5E5"> is due to sense to make</font>

609
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:37,850
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is sensible to change path</font>

610
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,750
information because some kind of prepend

611
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:47,540
or something like that because the idea

612
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:51,320
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting but not sure if in</font>

613
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:55,010
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation we will achieve the same</font>

614
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:58,700
performance you you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

615
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:02,629
lose some more specific information for

616
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that thank you yes we look into that</font>

617
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,260
we're looking also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to traffic</font>

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,390
but what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion that we we</font>

620
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,520
arrived at is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away I mean this</font>

621
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,770

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">pads nearby where the traffic</font>

623
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,480

00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,100
internet it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter too much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

625
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,480
it has an impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your providers may</font>

626
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,820
be on the providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your providers</font>

627
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,970
but not too far away and it's it's

628
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,710
possible to implement dragon and exclude

629
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,630
let's say it is excluded the filtering

630
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,630
strategy from your<font color="#CCCCCC"> providers so you say</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like just specifically my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you would filter ok but far away it</font>

equivalent but that's more perhaps more

639
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,800
abstract an equivalent way of doing

640
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,200
traffic engineering where the note that

generates<font color="#E5E5E5"> this more the left specific</font>

talk with you with the details later<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

is it doesn't under of details matter

646
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:08,280
but yeah we're looking to that having

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,189
absolutely our concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a divot here</font>

658
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,630
is very abstract it's just to say that

659
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,660
we have a number of routes and you have

660
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:49,150
to elect one that's what PGP does one

661
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,760
among a number so that's based on

662
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,260
attributes these are not necessarily bgp

663
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,160
attributes there are general concept of

664
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,840
attributes ok so this attributes you

665
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,370
would take into account let's say local

pref and<font color="#E5E5E5"> s path together it's a way an</font>

667
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,750

668

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented across the board at once</font>

677
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:39,189
because otherwise and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you even show that</font>

678
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,040
slides I think 13 some inconsistent

679
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:45,160
routing right so you said that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

680
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:48,879
incentive to implement this by other a

681
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:52,330
SS and converge but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means that it</font>

682
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,320
takes mouth and years effectively it's

683
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:58,659
not overnight so we will try to go that

684
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this with the current the current</font>

685
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,190
situation to my understanding ends up

686
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,250
with the long periods of the

687
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:08,590
inconsistency<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network from</font>

688
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:11,529
practical reason so maybe it's good

689
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:15,970
a good good input for their<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fife or whatever and the last</font>

691
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:24,400
comment based on the same logic you have

692
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:26,970
you can do less I mean do the filtering

693
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:31,270
only for the forwarding information base

694
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:34,240
right so keep the routing table as fat

695
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:36,490
and as redundant as it is so propagate

696
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,649
the prefixes everywhere but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

697
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:45,190
forwarding for the sub sub network or

698
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:47,168
sub<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix i think is the same as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

699
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,659
super prefix you can install only<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

700
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:53,159
prefix in the field and this way you

701
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:56,010
solve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phipps killing problem right</font>

702
00:32:53,159 --> 00:33:00,190
potentially reducing by fifty percent

703
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:02,770
still we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live with a big routing</font>

704
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:05,230
information base but it's a pure local

705
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:09,490
behavior which solves that I think the

706
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:13,539
hottest problem of today thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you right</font>

707
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:15,909
I don't thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very yeah we could</font>

708
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:18,070
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quick so like well if you do</font>

709
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:19,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phpbb aggregation you are not saving</font>

710
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,330
on for instance on the bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> set-up time</font>

711
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a session but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is the</font>

712
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,299
power will feel aggregation it seems to

713
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,439
me is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lose the congruence</font>

714
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:28,120
between the routing plan of the

715
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,649
forwarding pipe you are buying something

716
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,570
on the 14 pine and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are new</font>

717
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:33,789
changes on the routing plane on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

719
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:42,340
fit you lose it<font color="#E5E5E5"> only locally on the box</font>

720
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:44,168
and if you if you can do this on the you

721
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,809
lose the you lose some kind of

722
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:49,090
consistency also in this in this concept

723
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:53,200
right by aggregating by filtering

724
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:55,240
information on the RHIB level so if you

725
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,789
do this only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit it doesn't impact</font>

726
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,250
the whole network it doesn't forward in
