1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,780
okay and<font color="#CCCCCC"> our first presentation this</font>

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,090
afternoon is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim strange will tell</font>

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,860
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 weird</font>

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,990
and possibly useful things you didn't

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,990
know about international networking

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:35,350
thanks very much Jackie most my family

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,030
and friends would agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I am</font>

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:48,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">strange but the last name is pretty</font>

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:48,239
strong actually first to do that

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,080
okay can everyone hear me I believe you

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,640
can hi my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim strong and I'm</font>

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,430
from the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> research firm tell a</font>

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,739
geography and i'm here to present some

14
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,870
information on international networks

15
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,420
and how they relate to internet internet

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,740
businesses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,200
appropriate since we're talking about

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet that I structure this talk</font>

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,610
as kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 lists you</font>

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,070
sort of seeing on the internet from time

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,080
to time kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a BuzzFeed</font>

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,149
slideshow but without all the online ads

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,460
and I in hydrogen clicking for you you

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to click through now I know</font>

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,429
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're thinking right now you're</font>

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,830
you're probably thinking hey this

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,479
presentation could be kind of fun but I

28
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,650
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reassure you that nothing could</font>

29
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,259
be further from the truth and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

30
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,650
presentation at nanog at nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> Baltimore</font>

31
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,570
last year I started the presentation by

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,240
claiming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was an alien and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

33
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking off my shirt and committing</font>

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,669
various other high jinks I had I had a

35
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:59,340
t-shirt underneath but yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get</font>

36
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:02,009
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited no but since that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I've</font>

37
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,100
come to realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Nana community</font>

38
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,639
is an austere even sober group of

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,949
individuals so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the moment</font>

40
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,200
to apologize for my past behavior and

41
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,700
also to reassure you that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,569
upcoming presentation there'll be

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:24,000
nothing absolutely nothing that will be

44
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:27,989
strange funny or remotely interesting so

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,520
to begin this top 10 list of well

46
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,040
admittedly it is called weird things

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,650
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the international networks thing</font>

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">number one the machines are are taking</font>

49
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,410
over now at<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell geography we've been</font>

50
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,870
tracking the makeup of international

51
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,569
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that demand for almost 25 years</font>

52
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:49,230
now and for the longest time we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

53
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:51,989
remarkable consistency and that is the

54
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,649
the usage of international networks who

55
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,200
is almost always eighty percent

56
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,870
allocated towards IP public IP backbones

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,089
IP backbone providers bought about

58
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">eighty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the</font>

59
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,110
national networks one of the capacity on

60
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,150
the networks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's this</font>

61
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,849
others category and if you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here back</font>

62
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,150
in 2009 these column trucks were showing

63
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:16,160
here you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue bars the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ratio</font>

64
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,590
of those compared to others is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80%</font>

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,030
and again that reflects basically what

66
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been since the late 1890s when the</font>

67
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet exceeded voice so what's in</font>

68
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,420
this catch-all others category well that

69
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,010
is switched voice believe it or not

70
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,200
there still are some international

71
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,340
circuits dedicated to carrying<font color="#CCCCCC"> PSTN</font>

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,069
voice traffic it's things like private

73
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,230
networks for corporations research and

74
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,179
education networks and even some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns</font>

75
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,399
have some transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity but again</font>

76
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was fairly small stuff for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,299
longest period of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but in the last</font>

78
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,349
couple years something interesting has

79
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:52,940
happened we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a look here and see</font>

80
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,160
there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a handful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of really big</font>

81
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,569
content providers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to</font>

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,430
build data centers in different regions

83
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,890
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and furthermore they made</font>

84
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,170
the decision to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build internal networks</font>

85
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,470
with kapat of their own capacity or

86
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,420
purchase capacity to connect those data

87
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,680
centers in to mirror the data in between

88
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,078
them so essentially you could call that

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine to machine traffic hence the</font>

90
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,090
rise in machines here you can see what's

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,440
happened across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific the ratio of</font>

92
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the eighty percent rule is definitely</font>

93
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,169
going away the public IP backbones at

94
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,940
the end of 2014 barely exceeded fifty

95
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,580
percent and it's completely flip-flopped

96
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,560
across the Atlantic so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

97
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,750
relevant to us well<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a couple of</font>

98
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,139
reasons why it might be one is that

99
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,690
buying power has shifted away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

100
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">time from sellers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of capacity to buyers</font>

101
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,550
why is that it's because the blue bars

102
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,919
we split it up into the actual

103
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,070
components of who bought that it would

104
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,940
take about 100 or 200 different slices

105
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,520
essentially there were a couple of

106
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,800
hundred IP ISPs that purchased that

107
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,440
capacity but these yellow bars by and

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,200
large that's just a literal handful of

109
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,570
companies the big content guys that own

110
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,820
that capacity so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's shifted some</font>

111
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,680
buying power away from the summary cable

112
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,889
operators or international network

113
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,930
providers towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> them secondly the big</font>

114
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,150
thing that's happening is that's a lot

115
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,860
of capacity we're talking terabits here

116
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,530
and that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

117
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,840
subsea cables for some of the content

118
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,460
guys there's a scale where they're no

119
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,109
longer happy just going out and buying

120
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,210
wavelength here in a wavelength there

121
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,780
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to have for the most</font>

122
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,638
heavily trafficked routes fiber pairs of

123
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,929
their own and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not available to</font>

124
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,360
even considering well it's it's likely

125
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,909
that they're considering participating

126
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,610
directly and some new submarine cables

127
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,659
so that's really changing the industry

128
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,909
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the machines</font>

129
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:48,919
taking over I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really mean that</font>

130
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,750
they're literally taking over as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

131
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,628
see in this chart if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the</font>

132
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:57,020
x-axis that's a time and the y-axis is

133
00:05:53,629 --> 00:06:00,770
the degree of the y-axis is the degree

134
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,340
of artificial<font color="#CCCCCC"> intelligence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'm</font>

135
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,289
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought i was moved forward I</font>

136
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,210
guess I'm went backwards so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

137
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:14,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this chart the degree machines aren't</font>

138
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:22,339
taking over oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm sorry about that</font>

139
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:24,440
so it this chart okay I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

140
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:29,110
sorry about this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you pulling my</font>

141
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,110
leg<font color="#CCCCCC"> no okay</font>

142
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,000
okay it's okay i still have 39 minutes i

143
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:41,650
can i can boot up in this time so let's

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,990
see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I've never</font>

145
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,880
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> this boot message but let's see</font>

146
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,340

180
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,579
brought down the extinction of humanity

181
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:51,079
upon all of us I admitted them my bad

182
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:52,550
okay so just move on all right here's

183
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:53,959
our list we're back to our list the

184
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,870
first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machines are taking</font>

185
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,510
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing number two the most important</font>

186
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,610
new submarine cable of this decade in my

187
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:05,480
opinion is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be codenamed for a</font>

188
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">French artist in the name of this cable</font>

189
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,089
is the Monet cable and it's actually

190
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,060
named for Claude Monet the<font color="#E5E5E5"> waterlilies</font>

191
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,740
guy here's a schematic of it it's going

192
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be running from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Florida down to</font>

193
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,570
Brazil now I was I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> always assumed</font>

194
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,920
when I first heard about the Monet cable

195
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,660
that it was some sort of cool acronym

196
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,790
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it stood for something important but</font>

197
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">what some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cable planners for</font>

198
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,959
Monet actually told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

199
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,760
originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up with this idea and</font>

200
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,550
started sketching it out and drawing up

201
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,810
agreements in a hotel boardroom called a

202
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,770
Monet room and they put down this and

203
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,300
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial documents and</font>

204
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,000
assuming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would change the name</font>

205
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,109
later on but when they got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that point</font>

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,820
they realized it'd be too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much of a</font>

207
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,320
hassle to change the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this cable</font>

208
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,279
so it kind of stuck sort of as if

209
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,600
returned the Jedi had always remained

210
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,920
blue harvest that's a star wars

211
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,899
reference was a science fiction movie

212
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,459
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1970s early 1980s</font>

213
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,860
um why is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monet significant well</font>

214
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:10,498
again this is on the Florida to Brazil

215
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,949
route now if you look at these column

216
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:15,779
charts they're showing prices as roughly

217
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:18,748
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of this year for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 10 gig</font>

218
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,999
wave length between some big routes in

219
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:22,949
the world from from left to right we're

220
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:25,769
looking at London to New York Los

221
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:28,829
Angeles Tokyo Hong Kong Tokyo and then

222
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:31,379
Miami South<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paulo now one of these</font>

223
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:33,899
things is not like the other one of

224
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,540
these things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not the same if you</font>

225
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:41,069
guessed the big rectangle you're right

226
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:44,550
it's Miami saal pehle prices are several

227
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:46,319
multiple still for the most part of what

228
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,748
we see on the major routes and some

229
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:50,579
other parts of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that us a South</font>

230
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:52,379
America cable route really hasn't seen

231
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:56,579
the level of competition we've seen in

232
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:58,829
intra Asia Pacific<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Atlantic so what</font>

233
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:01,888
might happen with the introduction of

234
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:04,378
Monet and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just speculation but</font>

235
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:06,029
you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> back five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago to</font>

236
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,220
another cable that Google was involved

237
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:11,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this is not the first cable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font>

238
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:17,269
content providers providing it has been

239
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:20,399
a core anchor in that cable unity<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

240
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:22,259
used to my knowledge all of its vast

241
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,339
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of capacity or is using it it's</font>

242
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:30,269
not reselling it but it had a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

243
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,929
service provider partners and it's quite

244
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:35,879
possible that at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these guys</font>

245
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:38,339
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge amount of capacity fiber pair</font>

246
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,199
or so of their own and realized hey I

247
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,819
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need all this capacity I'm going</font>

248
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,699
to sell some of this in the secondary

249
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:47,040
market and indeed you can take a look at

250
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:48,660
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened during the time right</font>

251
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,790
before and right after unity was

252
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:56,129
introduced into service it when it

253
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:59,129
reached reserves or RFS this line is

254
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:01,470
showing prices over time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the LA</font>

255
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:03,509
Tokyo route in the green portion of the

256
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,569
line on the on the left is showing

257
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:10,079
prices before unity red is showing after

258
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:11,998
unity you can see there's a big dip now

259
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,550
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that capacity dumping</font>

260
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:17,300
from some of the

261
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:19,130
unity owners was the sole reason or even

262
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,060
the main reason for trans-pacific price

263
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:25,310
declines there's that market is already

264
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,640
quite competitive but there's no doubt

265
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,189
it furthered that trend let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

266
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,529
look at Monet what might happen there

267
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,180
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is a core core tenant again</font>

268
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,220
oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think they're going to be</font>

269
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,170
providing a problem to other submarine

270
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,950
cable operators in that region I don't

271
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be really</font>

272
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,959
reselling their capacity they need that

273
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:49,029
capacity but look at the other three

274
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:52,339
owners of this system alagar telecom

275
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:54,560
until recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> was widely known as an</font>

276
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:58,070
enterprise focused service provider in

277
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brazil Angola cables is a consortium of</font>

278
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,500
ISPs from the African<font color="#CCCCCC"> country of Angola</font>

279
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,779
and they had the concept of taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

280
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,579
couple fiber pairs on Monet from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Florida</font>

281
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:11,089
down to Brazil and then building their

282
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:13,939
own cable from Brazil over to Angola but

283
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:17,209
due to funding problems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the south</font>

284
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,130
atlantic cable from<font color="#E5E5E5"> angola to brazil is</font>

285
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:22,160
on ice right now leaving<font color="#CCCCCC"> them with a</font>

286
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,980
stranded asset and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> an tell org</font>

287
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,670
way that is the PTT the incumbent

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,910
carrier ferg way but organoids is a

289
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:34,310
small fairly small country do these

290
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,579

291
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,729
this capacity maybe they do but if I

292
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:42,199
were you and and if you need to get down

293
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to South America with a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity</font>

294
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,779
I'd be talking to some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these partners</font>

295
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:50,350
and see if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do a deal to see</font>

296
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:53,980
maybe they have some extra capacity

transport capacity there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

301
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,490
different mechanisms that are primarily

primarily used to procure capacity

303
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,680
there's all sorts of different flavors

304
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,570
but the two most popular are a lease a

305
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-term leaves very often in annual</font>

what you'd want to do is buy only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

see it is in the single digits compared

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,680
recently no one needed all that much

the gray bar portion of the bar is fiber

<font color="#CCCCCC">there is a belief at least across the</font>

fiber pairs that are free to be sold

405
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,920
that cable operators are not already

406
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:23,340
using and what's happening there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

407
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,740
that may eventually very soon drive new

cable development

409
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,240
and it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of funny because since the</font>

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">year two thousand three we haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

month we saw the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> nuin in December</font>

of this year we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see another</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">connecting personally I somewhat doubt</font>

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:50,300
without the support of the likes of

419
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,190
Facebook and Microsoft that some of the

420

big content guys who really want some

constant interruption here do I remember

423
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:04,820
the feedback from my last presentation

424
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:08,270
yeah how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do I don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't go on with this without</font>

429
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,809
beginning of the presentation but when

430
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,300
he got serious it got boring so that's

no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to tell a joke al no I'm</font>

432
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">not in the mood for jokes here buddy</font>

433
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,190
hell I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how does a tree again</font>

434
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:37,370
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it logs out okay yeah</font>

435
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:43,610
that's yeah well we get it we get it

436
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:46,989
locks yeah we get it all right thing

437
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:49,129
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> five time is like relative man</font>

438
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:52,730
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really interesting and i hope</font>

439
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:55,010
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will bear with me but we all know</font>

440
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,350
that during the course<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day there</font>

441
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">are 24 hours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are 60 minutes in an</font>

442
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:05,090
hour and 60 seconds in a minute all told

443
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,980
that's 86,400 seconds in a day the only

444
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,889
problem with that is that's not true a

445
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:13,160
day is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually about one and a half</font>

446
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:16,280
milliseconds longer than that just

447
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,470
because the you know whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

448
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,110
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it's it's</font>

449
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,270
longer and in overtime that adds up

450
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,909
every few years we actually have to add

451
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,450
a leap second to our clocks to account

452
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:32,420
for solar time for this divergence and

453
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:34,790
if an accurate clock had been kept since

454
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,559
the time of say Alexander the Great for

455
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,639
example that he had an atomic clock back

456
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,910
then it would have been four hours

457
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,740
but wrong from from where solar time is

458
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:48,510
it not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> tom not only is are we is</font>

459
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,860
the earth rotating around a little bit

460
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,840
more slowly than what we had to

461
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,209
traditionally count for in a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

462
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,060
we're actually decelerating as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font>

463
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:01,020
we are and the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for this is</font>

464
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:03,030
this guy the moon it's acting as a title

466
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:09,960
having a tendency that took to pull us

467
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:14,850
back so we are slowing down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on average</font>

468
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 1.7 milliseconds per day compared</font>

469
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a century previous so a day now is</font>

470
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,840
one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven milliseconds longer than</font>

what a World<font color="#CCCCCC"> War one soldier would have</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely adds up over time it's</font>

believed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the earth is about four</font>

475
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,380
and a half billion years old when the

earth was four billion years old<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

478
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,300
only 22 hours long so how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

479
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,290
relate to what we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about today</font>

480
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,330
well there's a one cable that's

481
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,250
essentially funded it completely

482
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,520
predicated on the fact that there's a

483
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,890
handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies that are completely</font>

484
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,290
obsessed with time and those companies

485
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,600
are called<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-frequency traders they</font>

486
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:00,360
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely latency sensitive they</font>

487
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,590
want the fastest computers and networks

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,469
connecting to their<font color="#CCCCCC"> computers so they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can sped out all these trades or more</font>

490
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,660
precisely they want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that no</font>

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,630
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of think is fairly clever it</font>

496
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,310
realized that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main reason for</font>

497
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,620
latency on over long distances

takes for light to travel through fiber

in the main rate or the only way really

501
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,220
Dino of reducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is to cut the</font>

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,940
1990s and early 2000s when all the other

and it makes sense to do so it's it

a danger to submarine cables but

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hibernia thought that if they invested a</font>

human I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little difficult</font>

543
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,500
difficulty conceptualizing what two

544
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:17,160
milliseconds is so I looked up what the

545
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,980
closest finish was in auto racing here's

546
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,110
one the closest in NASCAR it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

547
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand or a two millisecond difference</font>

548
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:32,459
see if you can spot the winner in this

549
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:35,580
in this video here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's a freeway</font>

550
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,610
race there we go they passed it did you

551
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,460
see it that's two milliseconds you try

552
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,050
it again see if you can guess watch the

553
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:49,590
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the top cars those are the</font>

554
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:51,899
two that's two milliseconds here's a

555
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,179
photo finish it was the number 48 car

556
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,030
I'm sure he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank his sponsors</font>

557
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:59,630
lows and Chevrolet so I'll go ahead and

558
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,629
do that for him

559
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,960
at 200 miles an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 milliseconds</font>

560
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:07,450
works out to be about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 inches it's fast</font>

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,369
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a lot but to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

571
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,100
would pay for capacity however they're

572
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,668
not that many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these kind of companies</font>

576
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:48,639
maybe a little less to build it wasn't

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be enough to fund a new cable</font>

578
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:54,459
just by selling low latency to these got

579
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:57,009
to these high frequency traders now the

580
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,100
good news is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bernie has lots and lots</font>

581
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:03,269
of spare capacity left on express so it

582
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,619
could sell this excess capacity to isps

583
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:08,730
however my asst peas aren't going to pay

<font color="#E5E5E5">20 times what they can normally pay on a</font>

another system for a 2.9 millisecond

586
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,940
advantage they want to pay what they

587
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,289
normally pay so the issue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> hibernia</font>

588
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,279
needed to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way of price</font>

589
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:27,039
discriminating how do you do that with

590
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:30,309
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't just give the ISPs this low</font>

591
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,720
latency path and charge them one thing

592
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:36,489
and then banks a tremendous amount more

593
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,399
so the solution is to artificially

594
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:43,529
degrade the service for certain people

595
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:47,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">in order to introduce so artificial</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">chicago to new york i believe so how do</font>

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,359
you do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> there there various</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of</font>

doing it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the low-tech way and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

602
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:03,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is the way hibernia went is</font>

603
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:05,619
remember propagation delay is what

604
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">causes latency I Bernie decided they</font>

605
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:09,039
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have several</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different tiers</font>

606
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:10,629
of Layton sees that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta between</font>

607
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,000
the slowest and the fastest being<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and a half milliseconds</font>

609
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,730
so to do that you start by spooling out

610
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,140
some fiber you stretching out if you

611

stretch it out over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course of one</font>

613
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,980
it's 22 kilometers that would buy you an

614
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:32,720
extra twenty two seconds of latency not

615
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:36,120

00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Manhattan's that will get you the</font>

620
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">equivalent of four and a half</font>

621
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,630
milliseconds of latency and they wrapped

622
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:52,620
it up in a up presumably in a protected

623
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:54,740
spool and and and then that that's how

624
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,030
you're getting your extra latency and

625
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,250
finally the last word on time being

626
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:01,440
relative if you're in your seat right

627
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,320
now thinking oh man when will this guy

628
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,840
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels like time is literally</font>

629
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,840

0.97 nanoseconds is the length of day

713
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,399
now 100 gig capacity is reasonably

714
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,470
common on terrestrial routes and it was

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> slowly introduced into subsea</font>

100 gig wavelengths and typically cable

718
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,500
operators and carriers try to price this

719
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:39,060
at a premium over the more common

00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,419
do this as a multiple but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

725
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,060
vary an awful lot it varies by region we

726
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,379
see the the average variance here being

727
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,980
between six to one in the transatlantic

728
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,080
and up to nine to one in some areas and

729
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,140
it varies by operator I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

735
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:18,330

you are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 100 gig capacity</font>

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,250
common belief that we're eventually

and five multiple probably closer to

four to five for 100 gig waves but we'll

743
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:46,230
see and we're back to hell thankfully we

774
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,848
it definitely is important to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

775
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,450
and shop around if you're buying

this is median your your mileage may

leading to<font color="#E5E5E5"> new infrastructure builds</font>

seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some price disruption in certain</font>

markets but the price disruption is not

845
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:33,740
even it definitely pays to shop around

846
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,750
the market is very opaque and it could

847
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:38,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">be confusing both dividers into sellers</font>

anything from our ordeal over the last
