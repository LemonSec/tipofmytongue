community<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we hadn't spoken to</font>

developing a new generation of leaders

87
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,330
to help guide this organization once

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,709
some of us decide to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and on you</font>

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,600
know sailboats in the Caribbean or

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,630
sound and able to weather any economic

93
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,858
storms that might had our way and

94
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,090
probably will fast forward two years

95
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:26,599
well I'd say we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty darn</font>

96
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,669
well wouldn't you I mean if you look at

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,310
it you see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we hired our first two</font>

98
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:34,150
employees ever a multiple actually in

99
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,110
the former professional staff we've

100
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,270
reached out to new parts of the

101
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,570
community through the education program

102
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,520
and nanog on the road we have held

103
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,969
multiple record-breaking meetings in

104
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,950
terms of attendance and revenue and

105
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,370
nanog is now financially stronger than

106
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,469
it has ever been in<font color="#CCCCCC"> its history and I</font>

107
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,270
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a minute talking about why</font>

108
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,100
that is you see the board and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

109
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">professional staff have a fantastic</font>

110
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,530
working relationship and that is due in

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,610
large part to the fact that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> board</font>

112
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:11,299
within itself has trust and honesty<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

113
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,560
feedback in a coherence division all the

114
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,910
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would want in a friend</font>

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,410
the board has within<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself and that</font>

116
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,479
helps drive a productive relationship

117
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,880
with the professional staff and in turn

118
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,400
in the end of the day it drives value

119
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,110
for you as a member and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

120
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,049
accomplishments that I will be proud of

121
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,480
until the day I die

122
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,310
today I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two things</font>

123
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,860
the first is when you cast your vote

124
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,660
don't just think about the individuals

125
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're voting for think about the</font>

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,960
entity<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> creating</font>

127
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,850
and how functional that board is going

128
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be because at the end of the day you</font>

129

the members<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones</font>

130

131
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,110
second thing that I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to ask</font>

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:32,540
fell off the stage so I'm just about

Gilmore and I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am also on the current</font>

itself that we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very strong</font>

147
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,130
stood here asking friends and colleagues

to elect me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me to lead this</font>

149
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:58,330
organization into the future we've

150
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:01,370
looked into we've spoke of education

151
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:07,510
financial stability and outreach

152
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:09,770
programs we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> preserve the</font>

programming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've always loved the</font>

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,049
high<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality programming the separation</font>

between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program committee and all of</font>

156
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,300
the sponsorship models to keep the

157
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,230
organization financially stable and I

158
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,550
think not only that we've kept that

159
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:30,410
promise<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also we've delivered beyond</font>

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,290
expectation in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

161
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,270
programming as well as the financial

162
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,630
stability that the organization has

163
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:43,219
achieved as individual I

164
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:47,150
in various aspects of industry from the

165
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:50,450
service provider to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the content side of</font>

166
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,810
the business so I have an understanding

167
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:57,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the different aspects and</font>

168
00:07:52,810 --> 00:08:00,230
perspectives of the entire industry and

169
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,500
I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put myself in</font>

170
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:07,100
your shoes as a board member to see what

171
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:11,210
your needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and serve them for you so</font>

172
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:14,000
I like to continue with that we've

173
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed a nanog on the road program</font>

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,270
which I believe has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been tremendously</font>

175
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,750
successful not just to bring in new

176
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,640
members and new attendees to the on the

177
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">road regional programs but as the</font>

178
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,620
outreach to people who have never heard

179
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,710
of nanog who don't have the resource to

180
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,960
come to nanog say we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to continue</font>

181
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:39,349
with that effort we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some of the</font>

182
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:43,280
record attendance for nanog in the last

183
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:44,960
two years and sometimes I wonder if the

184
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,490
meetings getting a little too big apply

185
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,470
to those are great problems to have

186
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:53,900
right so and I thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

over video and and doubted commitment

there and wish I could be there it comes

201
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,079
with more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of</font>

202
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,459
frustration and disappointment that I'm

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,960
not there in Montreal and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is my regrets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will go beyond the</font>

205
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,900
election itself and that's kind of what

206
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today I believe</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that like like many of you and like many</font>

208
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,510
of my colleagues who will currently sit

209
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,579
on the board I've traveled around the

210

world and gone to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nog's and knox and</font>

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,750
other gatherings of network engineers

00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,550
all around the globe I've even<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone to</font>

some I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETFs and I cans and some local I</font>

gf's and through all of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nanuk</font>

215
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,729
stands out as kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my home nog it's</font>

216
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,900
where my career is catalyzed where many

217
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,190
of my best relationships have been

218
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,750
formed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and where I see many of my best</font>

219
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,010
friends that's where I've learned some

220
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,960
of the things and met some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font>

221
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have caused me to have any any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

222
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,880
little bit of success<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may have and</font>

223
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,920
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think all of that together hints</font>

224
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,870
at what makes Nana great it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

225
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">an organization it's it's not even just</font>

226
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,180
mailing list or meeting it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

227
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,950
community and in a community of some of

228
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,650
the greatest people greatest engineers

229
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,720
that I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pleasure meeting I</font>

230
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,510
think it's where the strength lies and I

231
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,520
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board sits as stewards</font>

232
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,650
of an organization that's there simply

233
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,050
to facilitate that community to

234
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:48,500
facilitate the solving of problems the

235
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:51,680
building of relationships and the the

236
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,880
sharing have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a pea action I'd</font>

237
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,000
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to continue to help out with</font>

238
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,470
that throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> my career I've also</font>

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
tried to dedicate myself to helping this

240
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,370
community and the community serves

241
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">inside you cast your ballot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you to</font>

242
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,530
think of that community but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

243
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,229
more importantly of the communities that

244
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,630
it influences nanog being one of the

245
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,750
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> nogs of at least its model had</font>

246
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,529
then flip over an instant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and shape</font>

247
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,720
network operator groups fell

248
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,430
world old and I think we should be

249
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,019
cognitive that and be cognizant of the

250
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,160
folks that maybe aren't numbers maybe

251
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,019
aren't directly a part of our community

252
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,029
but either who should be or at least who

253
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,649
can benefit from it we think of all of

254
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we cast our vote today so I'd</font>

255
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,439
love to canoe to help out I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

256
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,620

this this great organization that's

258
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,759
already had so much success so we can

259

all<font color="#CCCCCC"> see successes again in the future</font>

while I've seen the community grow I've

268
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,809
seen it really go through its growing

269
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,899
pains during the split from Merritt I

270
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:14,189
happened I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PC chair during when</font>

272
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:18,360
painful and we had a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice board</font>

something before I do this the existing

278
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,649
nanog leadership is really spectacular

279
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:37,500
don't you think I mean you know I'm so

280
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,850

281
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,250
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what are the things that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm interested in doing well I'm always</font>

interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in building community I've</font>

284
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,290
been in the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source world a little</font>

285
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,059
bit over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there I mean those would even</font>

286
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,059
know me i know i do all kinds of crazy

287
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,410
different things but I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a working</font>

288
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,420
in the open source world a little bit

289
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,089
and their communities very important but

290
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,319
we had it kind of in a way before<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana</font>

291
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,059
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been a really tight-knit</font>

292
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,910
community so that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

293
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,290
thing and then um the other thing that I

294
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,019
mean there are many things that are

295
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:10,050
financial stability is a big concern for

296
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the board but also sort of growth of the</font>

297
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,599
community so growth of this community

298
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:17,550
and sort of the youth movement it's kind

299
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">of strange for me to be saying that but</font>

300
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:23,069
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's really important to</font>

301
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,660
get young people into into nanog and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

302
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,250
have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

303
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,009
leadership has done a great job with

304
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,870
that so in any event I'd like to be able

305
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:38,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be part of that and I appreciate your</font>

318
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,610
people whom we've helped people who over

319
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,800
the past few years of our leadership

320
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,910
have benefited from what we've done for

321
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:21,689
nanog that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got up here two years</font>

322
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,430
ago and spoke about my desire<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand</font>

323
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:28,079
the ecosystem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have more people</font>

324
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:30,388
involved in nanog and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to that end I</font>

champion the<font color="#E5E5E5"> college of urgent program</font>

326
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,620
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 22 students here today from</font>

327
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:36,209
three different universities we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

328
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,180
expect the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting we could go up</font>

329
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:41,638
to 30 possibly more these are students

330
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,069
who are passionate about what we do and

331
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more and we need to teach</font>

332
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:47,759
them because to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryan's point at some</font>

333
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,680
point we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all going to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

334
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">sailing in the Caribbean and just call</font>

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">it a day with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this but someone needs to</font>

336
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:56,219
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and you know what we've had</font>

337
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,100
failures we've certainly for example

338
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,050
taking the education initiative and

339
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,060
we've shelved it you know why because we

340
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,949
were teaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year's technology and</font>

341
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,989
it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us as an organization to</font>

342
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:09,420
embrace the change that's going on the

343
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:13,769
industry bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in and then start</font>

344
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:16,199
teaching people that the other thing

345
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:17,850
that we've done is as this organization

346
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,490
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> grown up and matured we've</font>

347
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,779
outsourced things right there's certain

348
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,129
things that you know we're all engineers

349
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,839
we like getting our hands dirty and

350
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,730
getting in there and doing stuff but at

351
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end of the day by outsourcing what</font>

352
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,339
the development committee was doing

353
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,378
which is sponsorships and things like

354
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,660
that our sponsorship revenues are

355
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,310
through

356
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,380
roof there three times what they were

357
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,270
for meetings beforehand and that's not

358
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,590
even a direct factor of attendance it's

359
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,290
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're doing a better job of</font>

360
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,900
selling sponsorships and guess what it's

361
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">not in this room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right we're a program</font>

362
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,220
is still neutral we stay out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it we</font>

363
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,260
outsource running of the network there

364
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,970
were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few bumps the last meeting but</font>

365
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,490
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the end of the day we have</font>

366
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,470
an SLA that guarantees us performance of

367
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,560
the network in this room so that you

368
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,420
guys can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> here know that you can do</font>

369
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,939
work and whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do on on</font>

370
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,650
the network while you're here still be

371
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,200
productive but also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to take in</font>

372
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,840
all this great information so in closing

373
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,210
the board as it stands today has done a

374
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,340
phenomenal job of returning value to our

375
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,900
members<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our attendees and I think</font>

376
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,370
that we can continue to do that I think

377
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have discussions about</font>

378
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,020
diversity we need more women in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

379
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,300
industry we need more minorities we need

380
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,780
the entire gamut because at the same

381
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,910
time as<font color="#CCCCCC"> this group is highly productive</font>

382
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,760
we could be doing more and so I look

383
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,800
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to over the coming years showing</font>

384
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that that's possible and with my</font>

385
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,670
colleagues Ryan<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Jezebel I think that</font>

386
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,870
we can do an amazing job for all of our

387
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,870
members thank you

388
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:52,589
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> David okay so uh quickly i'm</font>

389
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,119
gonna ask each of the candidates to

390
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,769
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll give them each an</font>

391
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,749
opportunity to respond you get a minute

392
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:01,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll cut you off if you use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font>

393
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:03,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that these might be semi redundant to</font>

394
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,549
some of the election questions but I

395
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:07,769
think they're important ones to ask so

396
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:09,959
we'll go in the same order<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryan starting</font>

397
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:11,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">off the question for the candidates is</font>

398
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh what do you feel is the greatest</font>

399
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,809
challenge that nanog faces is an

400
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,329
organization over the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

401
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you're re-elected to the board</font>

402
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:25,948
what are the actions you would take to

403
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:27,209
meet that challenge Ryan yeah I'm

404
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:28,889
waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my mic there we go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

405
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,799
can you hear me yes good all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

406
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:33,479
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know perfectly honestly I</font>

407
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,399
come at this from a very financial

408
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,260
perspective just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I happen to be</font>

409
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,820
the treasure so I'm always thinking kind

410
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">of in terms of dollars and in the</font>

411
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,168
financial viability organizations so you

412
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,789
know obviously you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the US economy</font>

413
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,740
than the global<font color="#CCCCCC"> economy always goes</font>

414
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,658
through bull and bear markets and you

415
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,269
know obviously at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the dow</font>

416
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:52,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna drop below 10,000 and nana is</font>

417
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:54,840
probably going to hurt for sponsors and

418
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,760
hurt for attendees and heard for money

419
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,610
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of our greatest challenge</font>

420
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,340
is going to be using the stores of money

421
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,510
that we've accumulated to to weather

422
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,918
that storm and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the</font>

423
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,169
organization's<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strong and viable</font>

424
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,269
through through tumultuous economic

425
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,100
times so you know what I plan to do to

426
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:12,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">help assist that is continue to be very</font>

427
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">diligent in the way I manage our funds</font>

428
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:16,709
continue to be very engaged in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

429
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,330
management in collaboration with our

430
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">professional staff about how we manage</font>

431
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,750
our money and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we're</font>

432
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">playing a long game here and that the</font>

433
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,649
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> will continue to remain</font>

434
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,730
viable and relevant throughout any real

435
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:32,158
economic conditions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you I</font>

436
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,929
believe Jezebel you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> next which is</font>

437
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,169
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our biggest challenge for</font>

438
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:40,260
the next three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years in my mind I</font>

439
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:44,429
believe the biggest challenge is going

440
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:47,190
to be the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our community that's</font>

441
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:49,309
growing and therefore the conference

442
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,490
itself is growing from

443
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:57,460
obviously we used to be seen attendance

444
00:18:52,490 --> 00:19:00,919
of 550 on average now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing about</font>

445
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">802 point of 1200 and I see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

446
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,860
continue to grow and I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

447
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,570
of you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be feeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're losing</font>

448
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,629
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intimacy of a</font>

449
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,870
smaller conference so how can I see as

450
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:17,059
addressing that i don't i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font>

451
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:20,508
that is a problem maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll find</font>

452
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:23,090
different venues to support that that

453
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:27,740
would create a separate meeting space

454
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:29,869
for people to see each other but we're

455
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on that and your feedback</font>

456
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:36,139
will be welcome to all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so we can</font>

457
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that a solution and the best</font>

458
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:42,519
conference that you attend every year

459
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks Jessica Chris renderman</font>

460
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:46,070
thanks i apologize i brought in just

461
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,820
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> you asked a question but it sounds</font>

462
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you asked what our greatest</font>

463
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,759
challenge will be over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next three</font>

464
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:54,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">years and I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that really what what</font>

465
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,919
Nana will struggle or will face as a

466
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:59,720
challenge is continuing to grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as an</font>

467
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,360
organization as a community continuing

468
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,009
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find new ways to add value back into</font>

469
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,508
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet industry into our community</font>

470
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:07,879
and then specifically to our members I

471
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,850
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has financial implications it</font>

472
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:12,320
has meeting size implications it has

473
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,149
services implications<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Nana like on</font>

474
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,220
the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> education</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that</font>

475
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:18,758
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of had a false start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is coming back</font>

476
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:23,240
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> are both really important and</font>

477
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:26,509
continuing to become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

478
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:30,490
value-added organization without sliding

479
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:35,059
down into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade show territory</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

480
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:37,399
thanks David yeah so I have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

481
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:41,269
three things that I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think about</font>

482
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:44,059
one is sort of the financial aspects of

483
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:46,970
things i agree with ryan that there are

484
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:48,769
business cycles and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to as a</font>

485
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,649
community and as leadership need to make

486
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:54,019
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nana is financially stable</font>

487
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:57,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that'd be the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one the second one</font>

488
00:20:54,019 --> 00:21:00,409
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably diversity and youth we need</font>

489
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:01,659
better diversity more<font color="#E5E5E5"> women etc and I</font>

490
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's a pretty that</font>

491
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,740
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty imperative thing to do</font>

492
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,330
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final one would probably be I</font>

493
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,880
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are others too but there's</font>

494
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,970
finally one probably be around scaling I

495
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,370
also group<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jezebel on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that as</font>

496
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,080
so the first night I went to it had 40

497
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,790
people or 30 people or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

498
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,909
that was a different thing and then

499
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:24,040
today while I was well I was it at the

500
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:27,010
newcomers lunch we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the impact</font>

501
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,550
of the size and and so scaling an odd

502
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,960
gracefully and in maintaining

503
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:36,430
maintaining its character I think it's a

504
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,590
big challenge thank you Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> Temkin sure</font>

505
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,000
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

506
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,120
challenges that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have is</font>

507
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,820
staying relevant to my point about

508
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,679
education we need to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

509
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,270
not talking about you know it's it's

510
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,040
obviously important we're an operator's

511
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,750
group or not an architecture group we're

512
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,600
not writing standards we don't want to

513
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,700
be a standards body the IETF does a

514
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,350
great job of that and the ITF has been

515
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,240
reaching out more and more to operators

516
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that said we need to make sure that</font>

517
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,960
we're on the forefront of technologies

518
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people are using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're still</font>

519
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,690
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about compte router bgp is</font>

520
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,490
number ten years from now this room is

521
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,800
going to be half the<font color="#E5E5E5"> size that it is at</font>

522
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,660
the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to make sure that</font>

523
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,550
we're not copying content from other

524
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,580
conferences we want to be relevant we

525
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:24,070
want to be fresh and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> dave's point in</font>

526
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,840
my point about diversity it's important

527
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,700
that we've got diversity of age we want

528
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,500
young people that are still in school

529
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,180
they're thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff you</font>

530
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,760
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes we laugh when</font>

531
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,260
someone gets up here and presents who

532
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,060
comes from a university and has looked

533
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,620
at some problem we're like oh hahaha

534
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,379
there's no way that they could do that

535
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,570
in the real world however the reality is

536
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">they bring a fresh perspective so I</font>

537
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:49,270
really think it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

538
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,120
bring in some new blood okay all right

539
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:55,629
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then second question Oh put to you</font>

540
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,760
again is what do you feel is the single

541
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,580
greatest quality that you bring as a

542
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,160
candidate for the board and we'll start

543
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and mr. Donnelly I'm I tend to</font>

544
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,580
be very collaborative in the way I deal

545
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,560
with not just yet a bunch of the board

546
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,689
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the the different parts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net</font>

547
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,909
on the membership professional staff all

548
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,150
of our vendors I tend to reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

549
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">tend to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

550
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,930
overshare when I shouldn't and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

551
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,570
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know honestly there's some</font>

552
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:24,200
reciprocity there so there's thanks

553
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">Patrick hey there's the that results</font>

554
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,100
sort of really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think at a high degree</font>

555
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,830
of engagement between the board and the

556
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,600
staff and it requires us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell a line</font>

557
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,669
between micromanaging because we know so

558
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,320
much about what's going on but also it

559
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,240
enables us to be strategic because we

560
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,149
have good operational detail about what

561
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,530
nanog is up to so you know in summary

562
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,750
being collaborative results in better

563
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,790
communication results in better value so

564
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:51,250
that's what I think I bring to the table

565
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:55,040

578
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,649
there's a really global perspective and

but I'm also everybody knows that I'm a

593
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,540
pretty much of an honest broker I'm

594
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,120
objective and I treat people honestly

595
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,370
and fairly and you know that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,419
think

601

not that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that here but I think</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">one of the best qualities I have is that</font>

I i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can work together with people</font>

00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,950
thanks Dave Duncan I think most of my

friends and colleagues can tell you if

607
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:49,289
I'm nothing I'm brutally honest I and so

608
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:53,190
I tell it like it is people come to me

609
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:55,260
to you know get my perspective without

610
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,270
any of the BS that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like to</font>

611
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,760
sugarcoat stuff with and at the end of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the day I feel that bringing that</font>

614
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:06,450
take what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our members and attendees</font>

615
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:10,168
their feedback and process it and just

616
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,840
discuss it without any of the vernier

617
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:16,559
that gets applied from some of the over

618
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,658
touchy political correctness tends to be

619
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,289
way more productive than spending a lot

620
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:24,510
of times spinning around trying to not

621
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:28,169
make someone upset because perhaps their

622
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:31,260
opinion is is not the same as worse go

623
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">great those were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the two prepared</font>

638
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,840
throwing that out was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of</font>

639
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,400
information it's not because I don't

640
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,799
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> he should get a sympathy vote I'm</font>

641
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,679
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying just keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">he didn't just blow this off so he is he</font>

643
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,490
is doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks</font>

644
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:23,190
Michael hi Steve Feldman CBS<font color="#E5E5E5"> interactive</font>

645
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:26,159
a long time graybeard community member

646
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,960
or whatever I have a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

647
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,399
education program Dave brought this up

648
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,229
so I question for all of the candidates

649
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,988
is the education program worth

650
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:38,809
resurrecting if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not why and if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so how</font>

651
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:41,509
will you make it happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'll go on</font>

652
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,190
the same order sure so I think the

653
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:47,570
education program makes a lot of sense

654
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:49,190
in is a philosophy and as an approach I

655
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,658
think there's probably a couple of

656
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,119
different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can approach it you</font>

657
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:54,259
know we've looked at things like so they

658
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,149
mentioned they've made a point about

659
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:57,739
outsourcing and being quite good at that

660
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:59,570
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are ways for us to</font>

661
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:01,399
leverage outside educational resources

662
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,019
that may help us do the job a little bit

663
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:04,189
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can basically do it on</font>

664
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:05,389
our own i mean we're community of

665
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,759
network engineers doesn't mean we're

666
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:09,559
we're necessarily all skilled educators

667
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,059
and skilled teachers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

668
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">bring in some outside resources that</font>

669
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:15,109
help help us develop curriculum

670
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:17,119
collaboratively potentially we can you

671
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:18,949
know educate our community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and help</font>

672
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,689
develop people and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially help</font>

673
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,039
draw folks in from outside that would

674
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,779
normally be part of the community by

675
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:25,369
leveraging those outside resources so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

676
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:27,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably gauge some partners and</font>

677
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:29,619
hopefully help us do our job little bit

678
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,259
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that area right thanks right</font>

679
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:35,539
as well I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the H opaque the</font>

680
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:38,749
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> program is very important to</font>

681
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:41,179
this community and we I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

682
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:43,639
should pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back up not necessarily</font>

683
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:45,830
in house but in a collaboration manner

684
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:49,029
with some of the research and education

685
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:51,769
networks that we may be working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and</font>

686
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:54,559
take their feedback work with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

687
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:57,259
the education institutions that were

688
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,649
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with to take their support and</font>

689
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:04,940
to take the community's feedback on what

690
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:07,639
is the current set of knowledge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

691
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,889
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be teaching the asset we'd like</font>

692
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:12,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bring into the community and create</font>

693
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:17,418
programs to fit and tailored towards

694
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:19,669
that and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to add that the</font>

695
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:22,009
reason why the we took we shelf the

696
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:23,929
educational program is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

697
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:26,289
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was important we wanted</font>

698
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure that we focused on our core</font>

699
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:30,649
competency on some of the projects we

700
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:32,718
had on hand which were the college

701
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:34,000
inertia immersion program the net knock

702
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:36,900
on the road and

703
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,610
the transition from a previous

704
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:44,100
facilitator for conferences to the

705
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:47,320
current one<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right sorry does hi</font>

706
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,730
Chris go ahead yeah I can't disagree I

707
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,700
absolutely think the education program

708
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,150
is worth resurrecting I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

709
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,380
well just anecdotally you know anybody

710
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,670
who has interns I don't know if they

711
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,320
have explained some experience i have

712
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,000
but i have interns who are teaching

713
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,270
about bgp when they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to school</font>

714
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,710
for networking which is interesting and

715
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">been from a viewpoint of information on</font>

716
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,920
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that educating their</font>

717
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,660
community and then creating better

718
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,190
engineers benefits all of us and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

719
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can absolutely pull that off I</font>

720
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,610
think there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nog's all over the world</font>

721
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,170
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're inspired by nanog that maybe</font>

722
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,909
have surpassed us in this way there's a

723
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> newark operator group meetings</font>

724
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,570
that end up having more training and

725
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,070
tutorials then they have conference time

726
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,139
I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's necessarily the</font>

727
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,790
length we need to go to but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

728
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,840
a model that's worth looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

729
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,340
they have solutions there that are

730
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:36,040
already tried and true that we can

731
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:38,530
probably leverage thanks Chris David I'm

732
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,330
a big supporter of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Education and and I</font>

733
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the education program will be very</font>

734
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:47,139
important on effort if for no other

735
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:50,530
reason because Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> squad or the other</font>

736
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,750
dave said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

737
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,450
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing so rapidly we need to keep</font>

738
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,160
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and I also agree that it</font>

739
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,070
would be a good idea to look at

740
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,570
outsourcing opportunities but also and

741
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,429
this came out pretty strongly at my

742
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,740
again at my new comers table today is

743
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:08,530
that this room is filled with the

744
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,960
world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> leading experts on this topic so</font>

745
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:12,430
making it easy for those people to

746
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">interact with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who want to</font>

747
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:18,280
learn is another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could do to</font>

748
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:21,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that happen right thanks Dave</font>

749
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:24,280
tempting yep so I touched on this before

750
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that education is</font>

751
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,420
is imperative<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us I do you feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

752
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,310
the way that we executed on it before

753
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,860
which was taking some really really

754
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,240
smart people and asking them to design a

755
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,310
curriculum when they're not familiar

756
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">with designing a curriculum was not the</font>

757
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,270
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to go about it was a good test</font>

758
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,550
and it got us some great feedback and I

759
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:45,850
think we'll use that feedback to come

760
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,530
back around and build a nation alam that

761
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,820
is valid not only for Pete

762
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,379
operating networks now and people

763
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,510
operating networks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future and</font>

764
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,430
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is outsourced tour</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

765
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">sourced or some combination of that I</font>

766
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:59,020
think that's open and I don't think to

767
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,879
David's point there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of really</font>

768
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,150
smart people here and we shame to waste

769
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,990
that knowledge but at the same time

770
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:09,070
smart people aren't always the best

771
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:10,420
teachers thanks I just want to end with

772
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> climate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does it all reminds me of</font>

773
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,870
something in a previous life<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a</font>

775
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:19,780
use news conferences and I remember

every<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nemeth in her I have a season her</font>

teach classes there that was a wonderful

779
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:29,080
thing i'd love to see something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

I'm rocking it

Arrington like Dave I've been to a lot

788
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,989
of nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of was in the room</font>

789
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:19,179
when they named it nanog anyway I just

790
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:21,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">heard recently that the best current</font>

791
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:24,460
operating practices documents are no

792
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:26,678
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that the nanog board or</font>

793
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:30,129
whatever thinks is important and it's no

794
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:32,109
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the agenda and I like you guys</font>

795
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:35,830
to speak to that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

796
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:40,269
community of operators and I think it's

797
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:43,418
important anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks go on the</font>

798
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:45,100
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> orders Brian sure so beat cop is</font>

799
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:47,759
something that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously mean we all</font>

800
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,529
we all think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important and nanog</font>

801
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,970
historically has operated under the

802
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,830
guise where the board and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program</font>

803
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,090
committee are essentially two very

804
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,439
separate entities because the program

805
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,830
committee has ultimate responsibility

806
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,590
for designing a quality program so if

807
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,658
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what be cop you know could</font>

808
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,789
be at nanog it could be a track it could

809
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:07,779
be anything really wanted to be as long

810
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:09,429
as it's submitted through the same

811
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,469
process we use to manage other elements

812
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">with an ml program so i think the desire</font>

813
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:15,069
to support me cop is there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just has</font>

814
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,418
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be supported in the context of what</font>

815
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:20,619
we do for all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other elements the net</font>

816
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:23,078
on program<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks Ryan does both I</font>

817
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,970
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same way that pickup is very</font>

818
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:28,629
important to our community and a lot of

819
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:30,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">people refer to that but if the content</font>

820
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:32,679
isn't there we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make that spot</font>

821
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,040
available at the conference for

822
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,569
something else so if the pickup content

823
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,730
is available there should be a track

824
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:43,418
made available by the programming

825
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:47,440
committee for that content right thanks

826
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:48,489
Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks um yeah I think</font>

827
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,869
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you may know that this is a</font>

828
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">niche near and dear to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my heart</font>

829
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:54,780
something I've been working on for seven

830
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,250
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight years now and I agree that</font>

831
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,140
banana tracking and having the program

832
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,150
committee accept content it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great</font>

833
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,980
way to go I also believe that the vco

834
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:06,190
Peace program itself the effort itself

835
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,049
is much larger than just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 90-minute</font>

836
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,760
spot and a meeting three times a year I

837
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:11,230
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the website that</font>

838
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,119
supports the work and the mailing list

839
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,859
is sports to work and perhaps even

840
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,660
professional services are all extremely

841
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:18,308
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep this moving forward</font>

842
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then keep driving momentum and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

843
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:21,109
keep building a program

844
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really allows the experts in this</font>

845
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,680
room to share their information with the

846
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,859
world with each other and with with

847
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,118
folks beyond these walls I think that

848
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">banana track and working that through</font>

849
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,690
the program committee makes a ton of

850
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:35,420
sense I also think that board and

851
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,190
organizational support for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vco fee</font>

852
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,809
committee was a big step forward and

853
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:45,799
that we've recently taken a huge step

854
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:47,210
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll just agree with with one</font>

855
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:50,119
of my colleagues have said and I'll just

856
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:52,339
add one other thing that back in when I

857
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,290
was chair of banana PC we tried to start

858
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:57,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like B Cup but we</font>

859
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:59,569
couldn't get traction for it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

860
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,819
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was too bad because as I was</font>

861
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:03,890
looking out over the you know the most

862
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:06,859
of the dogs<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were existing at that</font>

863
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:08,299
time ripe apricot whatever they all had

864
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:11,180
what were essentially best current

865
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:13,790
practice documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were written</font>

866
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,589
by people who were actually implementing

867
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,240
those best current practices and had

868
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:20,359
experience with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so they're very</font>

869
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,129
very valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I think that you</font>

870
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:25,700
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should we should be looking at</font>

871
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and and finding a way to make it</font>

872
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:32,598
happen like Jezebel said through the

873
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,700
standard processes that's David<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave so</font>

874
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,099
I fully agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> knee pop is an</font>

875
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,930
extremely important initiative however

876
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:41,750
in order for it to be relevant it needs

877
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:44,000
to be global the internet is global it

878
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:46,130
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> north america and i think that</font>

879
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,280
North America needs to feed be cop

880
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,200
practices up into a global organization

881
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,450
the IETF has recently undertaken this

882
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,848
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited that nanog will be able</font>

883
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to support the North American viewpoint</font>

884
00:36:55,849 --> 00:37:01,609
to the IETF operator community from an

885
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">analog perspective we did have a beat</font>

886
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:05,540
cop community we did have a beat cop

887
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:07,308
effort in no way did we ever say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

888
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,540
you shouldn't have a beat cop track we

889
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,760
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was extremely valuable</font>

890
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,890
however it was very hard to find

891
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,780
programming for that track it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

892
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,730
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get responses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from people who</font>

893
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:20,119
were on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that committee and so frankly</font>

894
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,069
the program committee was always open<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

895
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,049
programming that track but it hasn't

896
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:25,880
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought to them and we certainly</font>

897
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:27,620
look forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> supporting the global</font>

898
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,320
effort but in you know

899
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:33,759
that is a pivot from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that we</font>

900
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,860
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> supporting be cop before thanks to</font>

901
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,330
so we're over time but if there's any

902
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">other questions I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

903
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth taking them we're just cutting</font>

904
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:47,690
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to great time right now so any</font>

905
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:49,910
other questions for the candidates<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it</font>

906
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:52,790
doesn't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it I guess with that</font>

907
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,740
will call it a call it a session again

908
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,420
if you remember please go vote it is

909
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,580
important for the future governance of

910
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,320
the of the group<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization</font>

911
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,310
and I thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> the candidates for coming</font>
