work for first of all PG&E has been

offering energy efficiency programs now

64
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,239
to our customers for 30 years everything

dairies our customers have grown to

expect these programs so even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> pge</font>

69
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,880
wanted not to do the programs i think

70
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,340
there would be a hue and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cry from our</font>

71

customer base all of our customers

72

benefit through lower rates and let me

73
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">just give you a quick economic point of</font>

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,440
view around energy efficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> pge buys a</font>

75
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,329
certain proportion of the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">deliver to our customers we go out on an</font>

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,010
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> market and buy that power nominally</font>

78
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,980
speaking it<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs us about six cents a</font>

79
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,130
kilowatt hour to do that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

a kilowatt hour for say three<font color="#CCCCCC"> cents</font>

82
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,530
through incentives through education

through the services that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we provide</font>

84
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,000
clearly there's a margin there a cost

actually saving all of my customers

94
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,930
through lower rates I will point out

95
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,060
that in California different than

facing two sets of challenges in my

159

opinion one is they want to save money

160
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,910
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the right thing for the</font>

environment in their own facilities

162
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,180
they're facing in their facilities

163
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,039
especially their data centers the

164
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,590
challenges that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

165
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,630
facing in your operations lack of power

166
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,780
space and cooling lack of capacity

167
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:56,090
planning a lot of issues around that and

168
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,359
then every high-tech company at least

<font color="#E5E5E5">has a presence in Silicon Valley so I am</font>

market and this is a real puzzling slide

181
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:34,160
for us I don't know what the load of

183
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,090
have asked a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,940
people and they don't know either I've

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,979
had some very very major companies with

three letter initials sit across from<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,780
and say could<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see your customer list</font>

188
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,060
for data centers because they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

189
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,280
where they are either so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

estimated what I think the load of data

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,119
centers are in my service area now

192
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,210
there's a brilliant paper from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonathan</font>

199
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,260
because if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at any list of where</font>

202
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,590
it's usually in the top five if not the

203
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,020
top two or three so I've gone ahead and

204
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,869
estimated two and a half percent I also

205
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,700
I know where some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big data</font>

210
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,799
know where the multi megawatt data

211
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,680

212
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,510
as a utility but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sit in an office in</font>

213
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,260
downtown San Francisco and I look at

214
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,880
office buildings all around me

215
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's data center</font>

216
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,650
space in those office buildings but to

217
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,810
pge they look like office<font color="#E5E5E5"> buildings I</font>

218
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,790
have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea about corporate data</font>

219
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,130
centers they're hidden in campuses

220
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,099
they're hidden all over the place so we

221
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,800
have no way of figuring out exactly how

222
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,240
much load that represents and lastly we

223
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,439
coined a term this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a San</font>

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,480
Francisco term closet servers okay this

225
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,890
is where you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the law office and</font>

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,960
you walk down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hall and there's a</font>

227
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,390
room and it says telecom on the outside

228
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,190
and you open that closet up and the heat

229
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,500
just wife's out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

230
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,390
stuffed it with IT equipment and we

231
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,910
found a law office where every attorney

232
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,640
had their own server and they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200</font>

233
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,770
servers jammed in a closet so that kind

234
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,130
of load I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to get a hold</font>

235
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">on so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the challenge for everyone</font>

236
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,580
in all three of these categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

237
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,250
frankly because I have dealt with

238
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,170
companies as small as 1 800 radiator

239
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,120
that sells car radiators over the

240
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet and they've had challenges with</font>

fifty sixty percent IT workloads and

263
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,520
then the real story that i think is

hundred percent annual rates and i'll

271
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,530
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you my own story of that a PG&E I</font>

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,270
nominally speaking I read those meters

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,189
once a month that's a data set that I

276

something to think about why did they

have been hiring people and growing this

you just in layman's<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms what that</font>

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,100
them 800,000 more to build it the way we

spected a lot of money big investment on

when I took the program on in 2006 this

is all air conditioning outside nothing

00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:43,649
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2006 the first thing I did</font>

430
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,090
was very very risky i announced a

431
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,030
program that said if you're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

432
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,189
take out a rack of old servers and

433
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,950
replace them with quote unquote premium

434
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,620
efficiency servers I can help pay for

435
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,260
that we made a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of noise with that</font>

436
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,780
announcement our partner on that was son

437
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,850
I have worked with many other people in

438
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,790
the industry not getting a lot of

439
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,129
applications for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of program</font>

440
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:11,040
dangerous program for me because what is

441
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,380
a premium efficiency server you buy a

442
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,510
server today from any manufacturer you

443
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,970
will get the equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero to 60</font>

444
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,340
time and a top speed but there's no

445
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,740
miles per gallon city/highway on the

446
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,810
sticker on the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the box now</font>

447
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm standing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is a utility saying I</font>

448
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:30,240
will help pay for the equivalent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

449
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,429
hybrids instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SUVs but there's no</font>

450
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,200
sticker for me to point to so i'm

451
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,060
waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry to get their</font>

452
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,980
act together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with a rating</font>

453

system and spec and<font color="#E5E5E5"> green grid are</font>

454
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,660
trying to do that as soon as they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

455
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,730
will expand that program but i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

456
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,740
you making<font color="#CCCCCC"> that announcement got me a</font>

457
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,240
lot of phone calls and entrées into a

458
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,920
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of businesses that I didn't have</font>

459
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
before so it generated a lot of

460
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,660
excitement very risky for me as a

461
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,550
utility person but it was a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

462
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">we also announced incentives for</font>

463
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,510
virtualization and really it's not for

464
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtualization it's for consolidation</font>

465
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,280
we're paying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take underutilized</font>

466
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,470
equipment out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data center and</font>

467
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,710
this one has been big for us we've got

468
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 50 applications in some complaints</font>

469
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how the program operates and i'll</font>

470
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,800
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how we're going to improve it</font>

471
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,530
in just a moment but a big program very

472
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,960
very positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us airflow control</font>

473
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:25,260
systems these are from the big guys like

474
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,260
IBM and from HP HP's products called

to any equipment it gets that number way

482
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:46,510
down so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing incentives for that</font>

00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">high efficiency</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ups made some big plays</font>

484
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,890
with that especially with AT&T<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their</font>

everything else you're getting some

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,760
power to your equipment if we can get

495
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those stages out there's</font>

what we did in 2007 incentives for made

takes a little longer to get it

don't touch the keyboard the pc goes off

575
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,210
we give it a rebate for that fifteen

how many volume servers you moved out

590

virtualize and i'll pay you 150 dollars

looking for maybe just a megawatt of

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,260

610
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,440
months so folks as an industry as a

611
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,870
community we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get it together</font>

612
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,820
and make this a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more popular now</font>

613
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,770
that being said I have formed a

614
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:06,070
coalition and a large part of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

615
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,990
now is go across the country talking to

616
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,240
utilities trying to get them to adopt

617
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,670
the same program models that we have

618
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,010
adopted here in Northern California so

619
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,770
that when you go back to Houston or when

620
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,870
you go to Manhattan your utility will

621
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,389
offer at least some if not all the

622
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,040
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pge is offering here so we</font>

623
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,720
consider this part of our leadership

<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility our environmental</font>

business day is may

everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm proposing everything</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm promoting around energy</font>

647

efficiency I understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

fundamental level it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to work however</font>

649
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:24,320
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up this</font>

650
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:26,629
hierarchy at least into the capacity

651
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,240
planning stage and don't be the third

652
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:31,129
one here which is the emergency capacity

653
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,379
planning meaning you've got to go buy a

654
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:34,789
shipping container full of gear<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

you didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were going to</font>

657
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,870
short-term and long-term and I think

658
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:44,750
energy efficiency<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have a real key</font>

659
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:47,268
role to play in extending the lifetime

660
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:50,389
of your existing facilities if you start

661

longer than it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is otherwise now the</font>

665
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,219
third level up is financial reward

666
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:03,710
through partnership this is where at

667
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,379
least your facility manager and your CIO

668
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,570
are talking about sharing the costs for

669
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:10,820
doing energy efficiency programs as well

670
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">as the benefits all the financial things</font>

671
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,830
not a lot of companies operating up here

672
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,559
there really aren't the last one I have

673
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:22,309
at the top is green IT this is a purely

674
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,799
imaginary state where somebody called an

675
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:27,678
environmental czar<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your company comes</font>

676
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,480
down to the CIO and says get your stuff

677
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,279
more efficient because it's the right

678
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,440
thing to do I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the money</font>

679
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't care about the savings I have</font>

680
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,269
never seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen anywhere so green</font>

681
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:42,678
IT to me is a fictional<font color="#E5E5E5"> state at least</font>

682
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:45,019
for now my recommendations assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

683
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,059
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all IT folks join the climate</font>

684
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:49,840
savers computing initiative this is an

685
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,850
organization started by Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Intel</font>

686
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:57,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">PG&E is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a member on the board by the</font>

687
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:58,730
80-plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCs and put in power management</font>

688
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,799
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only two things you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

689
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,230
to commit to to join climate savers I

690
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,418
think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great strategy for you if</font>

691
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,470
you have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility because it</font>

692
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:08,720
tells everybody in your organization

693
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,669
that you're serious about the

694
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,259
environmental consequences of the stuff

695
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:14,899
you're operating so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good</font>

696
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:17,419
inspect the LCD monitors as a third

697
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:19,309
thing around workstations and consider

698
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:20,330
your thin client options so this is all

699
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:23,240
workstation rule

700
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:26,360
back in your data center if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have not</font>

yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> begun to virtualize get with the</font>

program and if you're only doing it in

703
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:33,230
dev test move it into production I know

704
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:36,980
very few people who have moved it into
