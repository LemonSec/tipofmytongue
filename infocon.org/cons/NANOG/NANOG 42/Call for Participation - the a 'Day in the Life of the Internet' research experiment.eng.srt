from internet systems consortium no

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,940
front of measurement factory and sorry

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,660
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I and I do a lot of work</font>

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,269
with kada and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for kada so today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,740
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> caidas upcoming day in the</font>

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,589
life of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet data collection</font>

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,419
project this first slide is the the very

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">short story so you can you can pay</font>

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,700
attention to this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then decide if you</font>

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,000
want to pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rest of the</font>

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,239
talk or not in about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a month in March</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,579
are organizing a data collection event

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,370
following some previous efforts in 2006

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,989
and 2007 we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all have very</font>

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,669
interesting data and your data could

17
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,199
help researchers answer interesting

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,100
questions and we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> love for you to</font>

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,289
participate and help us collect data

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,940
want to make a really emphasize this

21
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,059
point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to</font>

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,449
send your data to us we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,009
collect the data if you need us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store</font>

24
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,048
the data we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we can arrange for</font>

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,990
that but we really want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> collect</font>

26
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,330
the data and then describe it in index

27
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,149
it into a database so that other

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:19,500
researchers can find it and find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,090
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then contact you so</font>

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,360
the day on the life<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the internet was</font>

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,000
motivated by a report from 2001 the

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,479
challenged internet researchers to to do

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,310
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this to capture a solid</font>

34
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,939
day of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make it as widely</font>

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,060
available to researchers as possible

36
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:42,990
kate is first diddle event was in 2006

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,060
where we coordinated collection of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

38
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,360
root server traces for a 48-hour period

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,430
in 2007 we essentially repeated that

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,590
although we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> expanded a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and got</font>

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,439
some additional data which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font>

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,149
about next so inspired<font color="#CCCCCC"> by all this</font>

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,570
success we we hope to expand it even

44
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:06,810
further this year and and get lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

45
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:07,979
cool data from folks like you I won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">through all these but this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list of</font>

47
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,810
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we got for 2007 we had</font>

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">five root servers participating</font>

49
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:21,700
some s112 servers and some servers from

50
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,280
the open root server<font color="#E5E5E5"> network some</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">universities in Japan and Korea and the</font>

u.s. gave us or didn't give us they

53
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:38,019
collected packet captures on the little

54
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">dates and so on here's a list of a few</font>

55
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,360
interesting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we learned from</font>

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">our 2007 data this is largely just DNS</font>

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,380
stuff but five percent of the clients

58
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,690
are responsible for ninety-five percent

59
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,160
of the load at the root servers did that

60
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,940
we were measuring and again

61
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,590
approximately one to two percent of the

62
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,940
queries to the roots are what we

63
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:04,209
consider legitimate the rates<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

64
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:08,859
saw basically doubled between 2006 and

65
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:10,630
2007 and the root servers use of any

66
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,599
cast is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective at localizing</font>

67
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:17,319
resource consumption and limiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

68
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,858
impact of DDoS attacks so this graph

69
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,470
kind of shows a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit the latter</font>

70
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:27,030
this shows where plants are and where

71
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:30,430
servers are the servers are located

72
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,690
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the x-axis roughly corresponding</font>

73
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:38,950
to longitude client locations are

74
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:42,040
color-coded so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example this yellow</font>

75
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,170
section represents clients located<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

76
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">Asia and for the most part you know the</font>

77
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,339
server is located in Asia get queries

78
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,569
from clients located in Asia and servers

79
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,370
located in Europe get queries from

80
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,690
clients located in Europe and so on

81
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,220
there's a few you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

82
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,269
anomalies but for the most part it's

83
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,269
it's what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would expect</font>

84
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,490
this graph shows our analysis of of the

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,520
pollution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see at the roots</font>

86
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:11,490
here's two graphs 14<font color="#CCCCCC"> c return-1 for f</font>

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,730
fruit each graph has five vertical bars

88
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:17,668
these are groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> of clients organized</font>

89
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,279
grouped by their mean query rate so for

90
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">example the the low query rate clients</font>

91
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,840
are on the left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the high rate ones</font>

92
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,370
are on the right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you</font>

93
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,909
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see the</font>

94
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,430
different colors there but this light

95
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,360
tan section represents what we consider

96
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,350
legitimate queries and of course as you

97
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,169
look to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the higher and higher rate</font>

98
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,930
sources you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> their percent of</font>

99
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,219
legitimate queries is none one

100
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,980
interesting thing about the effort data

101
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,130
is this huge blue section here these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

102
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,820
all queries for top-level domains that

103
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,590
are not not valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for some reason a</font>

104
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:01,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">fruit attracts a lot of that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

105
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:05,669
traffic here's a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font>

106
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">we learned from our collection process</font>

107
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,680
in 2007 you need you always need more

108
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,479
disk space than you think collecting the

109
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,940
data is easy sometimes indexing the data

110
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,490
is hard I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip ahead a little</font>

111
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,419
bit here here's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the questions</font>

112
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:24,150
that we hope to answer with our data

113
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,799
again next year looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> more at the</font>

114
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,679
source of the root server garbage

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,080
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for trends in ipv6 and DNS</font>

116
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:36,660
second packet sizes and usage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

117
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,419
looking at adoption<font color="#CCCCCC"> of internationalized</font>

118
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,580
domain names were really curious why so

119
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,740
many clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to query the old</font>

120
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,390
root server IP addresses after they've

121
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:51,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">moved here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some more questions these</font>

122
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,979
are all sort of non DNS related other

123
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions that we think could be</font>

124
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,140
answered with data that's collected for

125
00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:00,120
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> diddle event things about botnets</font>

126
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,740
characterizing traffic you know

127
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,050
applications web<font color="#CCCCCC"> void video so on we're</font>

128
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,050
interested in if ipv6 traffic is much

129
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,190
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for most of us the</font>

130
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,670
only thing we can do with these six at

131
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,810
this point is ping

132
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,380
you know is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else going</font>

133
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,580
on that we don't know about is research

134
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:24,520
and education traffic different than

135
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:25,750
commercial traffic one minute oh here's

136
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:32,349
more questions I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip over</font>

137
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:33,960
the slide so again one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I</font>

138
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,220
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hammer home is that</font>

139
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,070
diddle wants to be very accommodating to

140
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,750
to your terms and conditions for data

141
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,370
that you can collect so if you can

142
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,770
collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data you can define how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

143
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,240
made available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to others you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may give it</font>

144
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,919
