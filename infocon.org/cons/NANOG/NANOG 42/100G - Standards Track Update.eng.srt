1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:09,389
okay and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that without we're gonna</font>

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,129
go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get started this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> morning is</font>

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our ongoing</font>

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,370
theme it now that we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the last</font>

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,880
few meetings of the hunter gig stuff leg

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,340
issues it we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have mr.</font>

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,939
Hankins give us a quick update on what's

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,650
been going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the I Triple E and</font>

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:29,250
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster they're working this</font>

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,129
week and then we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go ahead and</font>

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a panel up here one I of them point</font>

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,110
out about our panel we were supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,879
have four panelists one of them has is

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,260
missing in action so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,699
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and cover as much of</font>

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,280
the material we had planned initially

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,989
with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> three plus we have up here and</font>

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,520
we'll see how that goes we might get

19
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,288
some time back since we only have<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:59,070
instead of four so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll head and roll</font>

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:01:01,890
in here Greg come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> up oh it should be</font>

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">on here let's take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> skews you</font>

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:11,810
powerful video you swing was it control

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,810
phone I forget

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good morning everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">start off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a quick update on where</font>

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,380
the I Triple E is and for those of you

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,180
that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been paying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attention to the</font>

29
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,829
regular updates that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been giving</font>

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,969
it'll be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a summary and</font>

31
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:33,110
then some new stuff this is the

32
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:34,640
customary slide that I show you that

33
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,590
says I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the I Triple E and</font>

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,720
represent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Triple E in any sort of</font>

35
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:43,399
formal position and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all my own</font>

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,509
views so kind of to back up to last May

37
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,009
there is a lot of discussion and

38
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:49,909
dissension in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Triple E and it</font>

39
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,880
didn't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we're going to make</font>

40
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,049
very much progress because of the 40 gig

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,509
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred gig rates that were</font>

42
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,789
being discussed so basically everything

43
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,289
worked out well and last July everyone

44
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:02,929
came together and there were a lot of

45
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,340
compromises that were made and things

46
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:06,319
start to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward so there's a</font>

47
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,970
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of housekeeping and</font>

48
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,590
documents that you have to do in the I

49
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,180
Triple E so you've heard us talk about

50
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the power and five criteria and things</font>

51
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,900
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so those were completed and</font>

52
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,319
then there's a number of committees that

53
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,239
have to approve those documents and that

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,399
also happened last year so the good news

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,319
is that you know higher speed Ethernet

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,200
is growing up and we've reached the next

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">phase which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to become a task force so</font>

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,638
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a significant advance that was</font>

59
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,790
made last year so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

60
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,709
official letter which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> BA so he'll</font>

61
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,858
hear us talk about three ba that means

62
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">1,400 gig Ethernet and the key takeaways</font>

63
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,910
here are that there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be one</font>

64
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,340
amendment to the specification so that

65
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,840
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that 40 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 gig the</font>

66
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,760
specification is going to be delivered

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,359
at the same time now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,548
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might see pre standard 40 come</font>

69
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">before pre standard 100 or maybe vice</font>

70
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:58,310
versa but that just means that the

71
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,989
official specification is going to be

72
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,049
done the same time so a lot of people

73
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask me will we see 40 gig before 100 gig</font>

74
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,069
well the specification answer is no

75
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,350
because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be delivered at</font>

76
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:11,500
the same time hopefully we'll see stuff

77
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,120
in the marketplace before that though

78
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,760
here's a summary of the objectives<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

79
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,959
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted that are common basically</font>

80
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,910
this says we're going to do everything

81
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,579
that you thur net does already so we're

82
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,620
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the same frame size and use</font>

83
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:27,350
the same ethernet frame and things like

84
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,360
that now the one item<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the bottom</font>

85
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,960
which says provide appropriate sub

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">or fro at ian is is kind of vague</font>

87
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,230
especially in comparison to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

88
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,730
objectives which list specific numbers

89
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,290
and formats and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

90
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,160
have another slide on and what exactly

91
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,620
that means coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here are the</font>

92
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,020
adopted reach and rate objectives now

93
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,600
the target applications are what has

94
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,280
been defined in the I Triple E and where

95
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,859
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the I Triple E think these</font>

96
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,070
applications we deployed most it doesn't

97
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,770
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know you won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see a 40</font>

98
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,660
gig be deployed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way in technology</font>

99
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,000
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially after</font>

100
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,060
last meeting so basically what's been

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,560
defined so far is 440 gate reaches this

102
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,900
is targeted at server and computing

103
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,550
applications so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example blade</font>

104
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,170
servers that need high capacity in our

105
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,200
necks into an aggregation of core

106
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,180
network or back playing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet that</font>

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,709
would run<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 40 gigs and tie multiple</font>

108
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,080
service together and in a backplane

109
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,000
reach so the specifications that we're

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,460
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so far are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 meter backplane</font>

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,390
a 10 meter copper cable assembly and

112
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,609
then 100 meter om3 multimode now what

113
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,800
has come up at the last I Triple E

114
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,990
meeting is where the big question mark

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,169
is is a possible 10 kilometer

116
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">single-mode reach I have another slide</font>

117
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:47,299
coming up on that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 100 gig this</font>

118
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,820
is targeted at aggregation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and core</font>

119
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,700
networks so we have a 10 meter copper

120
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,159
cable assembly 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> meter on multi mode</font>

121
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then 10 and 40 kilometer on single</font>

122
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,740
mode fiber there are a number of

123
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,300
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> architectural issues that are</font>

124
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,520
being discussed in the I Triple E and

125
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,950
this is a complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides I just want</font>

126
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,390
to touch on it but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

127
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,460
figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture and and</font>

128
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,310
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we're going to do n lanes</font>

129
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,039
over some sort of multiple lambda or a

130
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,610
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> lambda or are we going to sort of</font>

131
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,680
glue multiple Mac chips together and

132
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,330
have some sort of multiple instances of

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,060
thighs and there's a good presentation

134
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,740
which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of summarizes what's been</font>

135
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,900
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so far in the current state of</font>

136
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,200
things for<font color="#CCCCCC"> each of these three options</font>

137
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,429
which is the bottom URL so that's one of

138
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">the major issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has to be worked</font>

139
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,990
out and there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantages and</font>

140
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,660
disadvantages to each and people say

141
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,700
well what's again what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

142
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">being and as always it's going to be a</font>

143
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,520
trade-off for for cost the current

144
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:52,480
technology feasible technology and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

145
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,760
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> some politics thrown it so here's</font>

146
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,130
here's what we're going to do for OT n

147
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,840
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is quite vague so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

148
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,300
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd put together slide on this</font>

149
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,640
basically the ITU and<font color="#CCCCCC"> an itrip belief</font>

150
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,170
have established a liaison together and

151
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,419
there are some of me people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

152
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,240
actually attend both meetings and they

153
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,790
will somehow work together to define

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:17,230
mapping for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,100 gig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the ODU tech</font>

155
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:21,220
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ot you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and otn networks the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU</font>

156
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:23,800
has already agreed to find a way to map

157
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,650
40 gig into<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing ODU three and</font>

158
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,990
they've also agreed to define an ODU for

159
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,450
which would somehow transport 100 gig

160
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,280
and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exactly going to work is</font>

161
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,360
to be determined because we don't know

162
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,789
what a hundred gig is going to look like

163
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,740
yet and we don't know whether the

164
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,320
feasible technology is but the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font>

165
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the point that the takeaway point is</font>

166
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,000
that we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> together on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

167
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,620
it will work over the win so for

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,530
physical layer specifications the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

169
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,690
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're answering our how</font>

170
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,580
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this going to work so we've</font>

171
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,040
defined these backplane and copper cable

172
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,990
reaches but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how to do it</font>

173
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet so the current consensus is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

174
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,940
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backplane</font>

175
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,429
Ethernet which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10g based KR and reuse</font>

176
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,080
that for 40 and 100 over copper but the

177
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">other interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that there's</font>

178
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,800
really no media defined so for fiber we

179
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,410
have multimode in single mode which are

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">well defined specifications for copper</font>

181
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,060
the world is sort of open to define a

182
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,729
new cable specification or use something

183
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,450
existing for example a twin x cable that

184
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">is used for cx4 could be reused so we</font>

185
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have to define what this copper</font>

186
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,140
is even going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like first fiber</font>

187
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is much more like I said it's much more</font>

188
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear because we have the multimode and</font>

189
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,720
single mode fiber specifications we just

190
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,320
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to make it work</font>

191
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,160
over those fibers so possible things are

192
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,260
a parallel or ribbon cable for the

193
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,569
multimode reach and then some sort of

194
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">WDM or it could even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a single</font>

195
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:59,419
real way for the the longer distances

196
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,059
now I did mention that people have

197
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:04,520
brought up the need for a 40km I'm sorry

198
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:06,589
a 40 gig 10 kilometer reach now so this

199
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">is very interesting because you know</font>

200
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:10,129
initially we're targeting this at server

201
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:12,469
and computing applications now there's a

202
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:15,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 kilometer reach and you know</font>

203
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:18,289
providing<font color="#CCCCCC"> otn compatibility so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

204
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:22,330
like 40 gig is turning into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> win</font>

205
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:24,889
technology you know despite people

206
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,180
despite people's objections and and

207
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:31,279
better judgments but so this is this is

208
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,409
a serious consideration because if we're

209
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,899
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add another reach objective we</font>

210
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,429
have to go and revisit the project

211
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,409
specifications and the power and five

212
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,478
criteria and you have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font>

213
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,458
justifications you have to justify the

214
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,529
technically feasible is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there market</font>

215
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:48,439
potential and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all these other things</font>

216
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:51,649
so that could slow things down again for

217
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,470
a few more months if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that</font>

218
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,420
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt this reach and then the</font>

219
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,740
other questions are back to the

220
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,269
architecture what's it going to look

221
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,910
like it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one architecture</font>

222
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,680
for both speeds do is there stuff that

223
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,110
we can reuse is there stuff we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

224
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,109
reuse and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some</font>

225
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,579
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to update</font>

226
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMP moves and things like that and</font>

227
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:14,089
then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't the last one is</font>

228
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,229
interesting because people don't only

229
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,050
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but you have to define</font>

230
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,509
test procedures so ideally you want us

231
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,370
to give you the same bits that you put

232
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,899
into the network so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to define</font>

233
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,490
test procedures to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that we</font>

234
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,439
have all these these patterns that we

235
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,769
can test to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bits</font>

236
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:32,509
come out the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this is a new</font>

237
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,880
slide that I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of shows</font>

238
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,699
you how this project compares to 10 gig

239
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,750
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of this slide is that</font>

240
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,310
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask well why is this taking so</font>

241
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,399
long and why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now and</font>

242
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,619
and you know why are we working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

243
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,500
terabit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet and the point is that</font>

244
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is getting to be a big project if</font>

245
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,430
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 10 gig there was an initial</font>

246
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,410
10 gig specification and then sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

247
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,219
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past couple years people added</font>

248
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,839
on different different reaches and and

249
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,199
medium to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> usual technique</font>

250
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,910
specification so with that 3ba we're

251
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:07,430
doing 40 and 100 so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing two</font>

252
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,410
rates in one project and we're doing

253
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,310
you're a gazillion different reaches and

254
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,439
specifications in the same project so so

255
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,800
it's getting to be a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> project and</font>

256
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,649
that's why it's taken so long where we

257
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,240
know we're actually almost at the sort

258
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two-year halfway point in the I</font>

259
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,140
Triple E so the like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the</font>

260
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,140
significant thing was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> task</font>

261
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">force phase so we're there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now and we</font>

262
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,330
expect if everything continues on the

263
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,820
path as it has in previous projects for

264
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,830
10 gig for example we fall a 10 gig pace

265
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,830
and we should have a standard out in q2

266
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,660
of 2010 and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next question</font>

267
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,550
people ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> is well when will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

268
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,469
stuff on the market and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll probably</font>

269
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,959
start to see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> priests standard stuff</font>

270
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,209
in 2009 and there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some</font>

271
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,520
interoperability events that uh that

272
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,349
people are already talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about here's</font>

273
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,180
a timeline that's much more detail that

274
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can read in your spare time and then</font>

275
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,550
here's future meetings and things that

276
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,140
we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

277
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the phase where we talk about</font>

278
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,490
specifications and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually decide</font>

279
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:13,339
a solution and then in September the

280
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,860
first draft which is draft 10 will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

281
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:19,040
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that that is the</font>

282
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,480
