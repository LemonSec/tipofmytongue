again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of capacity issues there it</font>

148
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,099
was retrofitting a building<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it a</font>

infrastructure back there you see all

153
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,350
the tracks coming up two feet in the

154
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,400

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,830

158

Phoenix there's certainly others but

159
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,240
this is the biggest huge building lots

160
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,710
of overhead infrastructure and you'll

161
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,240
see a fly out<font color="#CCCCCC"> next we'll go over to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">railroad tracks so you actually get to</font>

163
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,900
see where all the fiber comes in pretty

164
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,720
close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the building now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

wrong one wilshire another high-rise

167
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,560
building it says one will share across

168
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,240
it so it's really easy to find case you

169
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,220
wanted to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the infrastructure</font>

00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,310
you can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the generators and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cooley overhead</font>

174
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,069
again massive and again you're looking

175
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:00,900
at downtown environments very hard to

176
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:03,690
scale this is where it sits another

179
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,889
where I am but lots of generators and

180
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,479
cooling there as well and again near

181
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,280
some tracks I'm guessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where</font>

182
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,729
the fiber comes in I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is again</font>

183
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,960
just my opinion and now we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Weston</font>

184
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:18,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you looking at the westin building in</font>

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,219
stuff you'll see cooling infrastructure

on the roof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the garage and power and</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see a few buildings here</font>

194
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,459
365 main let's give me the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one</font>

195
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,050
were going to again a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> building and</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this came out of the dot-com</font>

era when everything was a dot bomber I

198
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,899
should say this building is full you'll

199
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,959
see we'll go to 200 Paul next and that

200
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,730
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> is full again another building</font>

201
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,260
you notice generators cooling everything

202
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,029
overhead squeezed into a downtown

203
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,319
environment so it's critical to

204
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,370
understand how this infrastructure gets

205
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,899
placed inside these downtown

206
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,329
environments and where data centers are

00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,160
going in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future again next to the</font>

209
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,140
we get down valley you're going to see

old Google Earth stuff what can I do

217
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,829
blame the Google guys so now we're going

218
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is actually fly into down valley</font>

219
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:29,520
area oh there we go so switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dad</font>

220
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,440
has got a big new site there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

222
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,350
of near kifer road and we're building a

223
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,729
big new building everybody's building

224
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,360
new stuff again all in Silicon Valley

225
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,990
power slide into the next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix is lundi site and</font>

227
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">i really like these sites for a very</font>

228
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,180
smart placement you've got a building

229
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,520
and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> next door where you can build</font>

230
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,020
more stuff isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that smart so now</font>

231
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,699
instead of in a valley area where you

232
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,660
have really tight space constraints on

233
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,920
land you're able to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

234
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,779
something next door so that's that's a

235
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,399
very good play there again you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

236
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,930
the same thing in 11 grade oaks you've

237
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,060
got a tectonic site and you've got empty

238
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,839
land next door so again a very smart

239
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,420
thing now<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's slide into the land</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

240
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:14,410
we go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font>

241
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,520
in that pretty land<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right here's</font>

242
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,819
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets it really interesting this</font>

243
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,939
is in the space park area and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">equinix you've got digital realty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

245
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,750
you've got a couple of DRT buildings

246
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,160
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo's got stuff there a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

247
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,240
other folks and if you notice right

248
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,290
there you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a power plant with</font>

249
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,520
turbines right in the middle of it right

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,949
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> door to you with all the fiber</font>

251
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,939
sitting there and again being very close

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the airport again all your</font>

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,089
infrastructure those sitting on the roof

254
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,890
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> squeezed in all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these centers are</font>

255
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:41,380
getting pretty full so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got Colo</font>

256
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,939
here it's full or getting full or or

257
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,810
it's not full but you've used all your

258
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,520
power now we're at Atlanta 56 Marietta

259
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,589
this is actually a telex building and

260
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,600
look how that infrastructure is stuffed

261
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,880
on every little<font color="#CCCCCC"> inch of space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

262
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,200
building is just max out again hard to

263
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,490
get new power and cooling in places like

264
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,470
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to my place</font>

265
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,150
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Miami map of the Americas kind</font>

266
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,730
of a cool one because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way how we</font>

267
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,199
get district cooling in place and all

268
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,370
the overhead infrastructure again inside

269
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,050
that building and all that has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,089
protected<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> category 5 hurricanes so</font>

271
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,500
a whole different animal district

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,610
cooling plant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually cool it so</font>

273
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,830
it's cooled from a building a few blocks

water into it and again a downtown

environment with all the railroads

277
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,450
coming in same form factors to get all

278
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:28,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff in place and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back again</font>

279

wasn't that cool guys I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

280
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> front of a crowd you guys are</font>

281
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,620
my guinea pigs alright guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

282
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,390
slide into a powerpoint presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

283
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,350
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead into the conversations</font>

284
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,350
we're gonna have with a panelist now

285
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so data center power trends an</font>

286
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,829
anode 42 power panel this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a panelist</font>

287
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,050
a very esteem panelist actually you guys

288
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,160
graduate yourselves good so these guys

289
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,420
are all going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

290
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,060
issues we're going to face<font color="#E5E5E5"> having data</font>

291
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,010
center cooling power technology issues

292
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,140
and green does it make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense or not</font>

293
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,610
which I sort of think it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

294
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,069
big big data centers from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big-picture</font>

295
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,270
standpoint we'll go through that so

296
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,820
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the issues here</font>

297
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,890
a 1 megawatt data center takes 177

298
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
million kilowatt hours worth over 17

299
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,620
million dollars over its 10 year

300
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,720
lifespan these are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyst opinions</font>

301
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,920
I'm just repeating them by<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2008 fifty</font>

302
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,000
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of today's data centers will</font>

303
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,250
have insufficient power and cooling

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its 2008 anybody</font>

305
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,120
realize that so that's today right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

306
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,589
we don't

307
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,930
enough cooling your power and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

308
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:26,100
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data centers by 2010 half whole</font>

309
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,660
enterprise data centers will have to

310
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,279
relocate or<font color="#E5E5E5"> outsource applications to</font>

311
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,480
another facility the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

312
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,980
that's important to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys in</font>

313
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">here because most of your ISPs and</font>

314
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,460
networks and things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your content</font>

315
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,050
guys if those enterprises take up all

316
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,490
the data center space you now have no

317
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,229
room for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers in your servers</font>

318
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that is what's happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

319
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hosting outsourcing everything</font>

320
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,939
the economy crushing they're all moving

321
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,260
into data centers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in outsourcing get rid</font>

322
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,730
of staff so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off that</font>

323
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,270
same space it takes two years to build

324
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is a fun factor we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> created 161</font>

325
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,449
exabytes of data in 2006<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

326
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,410
what we've done this year but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with video</font>

327
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,070
and everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else it's getting</font>

328
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:01,860
monstrous so what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the u.s.</font>

329
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,420
Colo market was swamped with space after

330
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,370
dot-com bomb everybody member the valley

331
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,900
every building was empty all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parking</font>

332
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,860
lots were empty it was a nightmare<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

333
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,560
all these coals are being sold for

334
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,510
nothing well those<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh got gobbled up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

335
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
those actually picked up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for pennies on</font>

336
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,620
the dollar and then filled up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7</font>

337
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,970
million square feet of spit of data

338
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,620
center space built out at a hundred

339
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,700
watts of square foot which is useless

340
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,500
today because a hundred watts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of square</font>

341
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,990
foot is as a band-aid on a big giant

342
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,279
wound it just can't handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> it today so</font>

343
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,240
it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone so now what's going to</font>

344
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,350
happen so that what I I no offense to

345
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,400
anybody I call them penny on the dollar

346
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,570
companies because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones who</font>

347
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,150
acquired the penny on the dollar data

348
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,670
centers that digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> Realty Trust 365</font>

349
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,529
main<font color="#CCCCCC"> crg dupont fabros are now building</font>

350
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,150
data centers 100,000 square feet and

351
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,270
larger these big giant data centers are

352
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,380
really high power now what's happening

353
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,579
is you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys doing meter</font>

354
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,500
power so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have more traditional</font>

355
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,520
colors like mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> terremark or Equinix or</font>

356
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,440
switch and data we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do</font>

357
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,910
metered power we provide what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

358
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,680
consider higher-end service and don't do

359
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,449
that but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are doing that big</font>

360
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,069
offset and a problem for us so it become

361
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,630
puts a lot of market pressures on what's

362
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,860
happening in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things yet is still</font>

363
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">very expensive to build these things</font>

364
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,730
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ne23</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IX which we'll talk</font>

365
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a little bit telx some exciting</font>

366
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,490
things going on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens it</font>

367
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,930
creates a war so you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pricing and</font>

368
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,640
business war yet we're all running out

369
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,089
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> colo so then you start getting a</font>

370
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,100
space crunch so now what happen all the

371
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">new data centers are 200 to 400 watts of</font>

372
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,709
square foot and that is an exponential

373
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">increase in the cost to actually build</font>

374
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,630
these things to get these going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

375
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,260
everybody'll be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that</font>

376
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the panel and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult that is</font>

377
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,560
the if you actually want to deal with

378
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">these combat combating these power cost</font>

379
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,109
issues and you're a big company like

380
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,579
Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> or Yahoo you're going up to</font>

381
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,290
Quincy Washington or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dallas and</font>

382
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,020
Oregon and buying you know two cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

383
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,400
kilowatt hour

384
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,150
who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm only taking a guess at</font>

385
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I don't know what they've</font>

386
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:43,390
negotiated and actually buying

387
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,920
hydropower so pricing now is all over

388
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,390
the place you got some old data centers

389
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,040
that are that are you know carrier

390
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,449
center of 50 or 70 or hundred watts of

391
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,770
square foot<font color="#CCCCCC"> their foreigner bucks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq</font>

392
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,420
so what because you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even put any</font>

393
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,470
servers in it anyway put two servers in

394
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,810
it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> four hunnerd bucks Iraq knock</font>

395
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,950
yourself out or you go to 1,500 rack for

396
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,839
higher end data center and fill it up

397
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,650
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way maybe depending on what</font>

398
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,750
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in there if its</font>

399
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,280
blades it's a more of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so now</font>

400
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,870
all of New York Colo sites are starting

401
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,860
to raise prices because we all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

402
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,510
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these really expensive</font>

403
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,430
infrastructure and includes more cooling

404
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,080
more power more feeds more commitments

405
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,939
to the utilities pge isn't going to give

406
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,080
us 100 megawatts because we say we need

407
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,000
it they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us financially</font>

408
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,230
commit to actually paying for some of

409
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with</font>

410
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,860
it and it used to be the public service

411
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,300
Commission's if you wanted 100 megawatts

412
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,530
of power and you told them<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

413
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver it and if you</font>

414
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,890
didn't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it oh well well now it's a</font>

415
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,270
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> different story they've gone back</font>

416
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,230
to those<font color="#CCCCCC"> pscs and change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that change</font>

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,280
that story so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

418
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,960
I've been using<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a couple years but I</font>

419
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,699
really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're in 2008 again and</font>

420
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,170
it's at 35 million servers inside these

421
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,400
data centers and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell</font>

422
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,479
me there's enough data center space to

423
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,340
actually accommodate all this stuff

424
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,290
you're nuts because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not there we've</font>

425
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,940
got a big big problem no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

426
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,650
comes on market it's going to get filled

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,030
up contents going to fill<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprises are going to fill it up it's</font>

429
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,770
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a big dilemma</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

430
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,450
and here's the biggest issue there much

431
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,170
hotter so the old the old servers you

432
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,670
had in two thousand or nothing now in

433
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,349
2007-2008 their blades they're running

434
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,180
sometimes 20 kilowatts Iraq you got big

435
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,040
empty space around them it<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes a</font>

436
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,239
heating and cooling nightmare trying to

437
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,650
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all this stuff we</font>

438
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,880
can always deliver the power load into

439
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,280
it but actually cooling it is much

440
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,810
harder this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually shows from the</font>

441
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:25,000
trend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of growth Martin's going to talk</font>

442
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:26,650
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so so there's a couple of</font>

443
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,120
different things going on your data

444
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,670
centers are not just full of one type of

445
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,590
equipment there's servers this

446
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,880
networking equipment their storage if

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,800
you listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Mark talked about</font>

448
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,110
earlier there's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories that turns</font>

449
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,060
itself off and saves power so all of

450
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has trended slightly differently</font>

451
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,219
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the years but what has happened is</font>

452
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,229
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of usage of each one of</font>

453
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,320
these items has also changed when you

454
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,550
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of content</font>

455
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,580
look at the amount of servers you look

456
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,770
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of of services that are</font>

457
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,510
delivered on on on the internet that has

458
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,100
increased dramatically yet the number of

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,179
not increased hit that one well I'll

463
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,159
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a data center</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i think mark did a slide that had that</font>

showed about fifty three percent is

472
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,780
actually going into hardware it you know

473
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,790
that it's arguable depending on the

474

center but the problems you have in a

of data center that Josh was talking

about but what's interesting to note

512
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,970
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that people have started</font>

513

of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways of measuring</font>

at what type of equipment was being put

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,169
into data centers in 2002 and if you're

pretty ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the curve then you're</font>

obviously the trend for higher power

prior to that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually go and</font>

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,679
look back at the presentations from<font color="#CCCCCC"> colo</font>

companies that said now we can do have

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,750
200 watts per square foot but we can

610
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,820
leave a big space around you and and and

611
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really from the data center total</font>

612
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,439
power point of view really wasn't the

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,169
type of document but I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of</font>

616
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:40,840
built up to 200 foot or higher 200 watts

617
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:45,640
per square foot or higher you're seeing

618
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,350
people announcing up to 300 350 and a

619
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,270
few people saying hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we</font>

00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:58,870
starting to do even higher densities

624
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,309
than that so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story has changed over</font>

625
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:07,600
the years but it's definitely becoming

626
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:09,639
more mainstream so now we get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

627
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,990
of building something like this a 20,000

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,159
square-foot Tier one or two to data

629

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,490
you're broke or whatever it may be but

636
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">there you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have it that's 15.4 million</font>

637
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right that's a lot of money now</font>

638
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,490
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you picked it up on the</font>

market

640
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,920
after you know pennies on the dollar or

641
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,630
somebody went bankrupt this is truly

642
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,340
building it an existing warehouse let's

643
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,570
say twenty thousand square feet of tier

644
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">four data center that's going to be up</font>

645
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:38,710
no matter what that's five nines or even

646
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,139
a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent s la's that's n plus 1</font>

648
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,170
you want to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really high-end</font>

649
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,630
redundancy from the uptime<font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute</font>

feet that's a big difference isn't it

652
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:54,190
guys so now the lead time to build a 200

653
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,630
watt per square foot data center 75,000

654
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,830
square feet is about a year it's going

655
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a year to build that building</font>

656
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">you got to order generators you got to</font>

657
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,540
get pd use you gotta do ground-up

658
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,830
construction you have to design

659
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">development work you have to get</font>

660
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,439
permitting you have to you know claim

661
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,330
you're going to give everybody a

662
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,830
thousand jobs and probably only provide

663
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,600
20 because it's a data center remember

664
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,620
there's no people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there you're going</font>

665
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,879

666
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,790
incentives together make all this happen

667
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,380
now the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IX</font>

668
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,940
is can't get the space bill fast enough

669
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,380
then I space and content companies can't

670
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,030
deploy or the enterprise's come in and

671
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,410
do that and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually will start to</font>

672
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,700
cause a bottleneck<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the internet it's</font>

673
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,840
been seen in certain markets around the

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,120
world where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually squeezed</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna do it</font>

take off<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole continent you got big</font>

the fiber doesn't really matter at that

696
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,809

that right in quincy<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million square</font>

00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,450
course is gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the Microsoft</font>

710
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:36,490
that you got my building 7 or 50,000

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,500
square feet and it full build-out be 100

712
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,929
megawatts and it's insane that's a city

713
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,280
in a building so<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooling issues become</font>

I not not<font color="#E5E5E5"> tapped myself in the shoulders</font>

716
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,350
of really cool thing we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in</font>

717
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,389
Virginia 55 generators and a possible

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,980
turbine site with one building actually

719
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">be 80 megawatts in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred thousand</font>

square feet that is 800 watts the square

721
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,490
foot now start working out those costs

722
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,850
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers i showed you before</font>

723
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:02,890
absolutely insane so now green energy

724
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,750
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make any sense you can shoot</font>

725
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,640
you see a Stirling engine here that big

726
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,010
wind turbine that's a three megawatt

727
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,210
wind turbine one wind turbine about a

<font color="#CCCCCC">year and a half lead time right now</font>

729
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,790
because they're hard as heck to get you

730
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,710
can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get installers to put them in</font>

731
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,270
oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you need thousands of acres</font>

732
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,950
to actually put that in place and then

733
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,530
wait the wind doesn't blow what happens

734
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,390
you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem no power so you got</font>

735
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,980
wave generation that's really cool too

736
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,270
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to power my hundred</font>

737
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,980
megawatt data center with a big tube

738
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,900
floating out hope there's waves that day

739
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,450
it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't work I'm a surfer I like</font>

740
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,710
that stuff but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the solar tower</font>

741
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,390
these things are be done being done in

can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this wind farm down below</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

cannot go and afford to buy 80,000 acres

753
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:55,570
and stick a bunch of wind<font color="#CCCCCC"> farms up there</font>

754
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:57,668
it's not going to happen so we buy green

755
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,049
power maybe pay more for that that's the

756
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:00,580
option but actually producing that too

757
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,230
for these big data centers it's just not

758
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite there there's different</font>

759
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,630
technologies you can use like fly wheels

760
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:06,820
instead of batteries trying to increase

761
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,929
efficiencies trying to become greener so

762
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,399
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> produce batteries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

763
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:12,040
factories and trying to dispose of them

764
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,750
later if they go bad there's things like

765
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,250
actually going off the grid this is some

766
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,140
cool stuff from united technologies

767
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,880
which makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Accorsi helicopters and</font>

thing 10 megawatt 10 megawatts be 200

770
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,460
micro turbines and you have an

771
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,809
absorption chiller system actually

772
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,490
generating the cooling out of that

773
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:29,020
you're actually off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the grid at this</font>

774
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,190
point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're actually generating</font>

775
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,809
your own electricity from natural gas

776
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,460
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> turbines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take fifteen</font>

777
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:35,290
percent of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things offline to do</font>

778
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintenance everything's still operating</font>

779
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,889
the bad part is you have two choices

780
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">here either use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the grid as your backup</font>

781
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,040
which still requires them to build all

782
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,540
that infrastructure for you have it on

783
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,639
standby and have a substation there or

784
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,320
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in tons and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tons of generators</font>

785
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,580
those generators run you're still you're

786
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,020
still not being green you still got a

787
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,820
big issue with fuel and everything else

788
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,950
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then if you try to go to 80</font>

789
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,059
megawatts you're talking 60 to 80<font color="#CCCCCC"> medium</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sized turbines 40</font>

791
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:58,720
and tons of absorption cooling I mean

792
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,979
you have to hedge natural gas futures it

793
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">really gets crazy and where we're going</font>

794
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,820
with this stuff anyway guys I wanted to

795

lead that into it for the panel we've

who we're talking to so we went through

816
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:28,370
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of stuff with Josh but what</font>

817
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,800
really comes down to is the fine detail

818
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,600
it isn't as easy to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

819
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,389
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> marks already talked about what</font>

820
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is like from the power companies</font>

821
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:40,490
point of view and in fact within the the

the various times<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've heard mark</font>

pushed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> envelope out of all the power</font>

companies in the US to try and do this

827
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,450
other people in other places virginia i

828
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:56,270
believe is now put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> program that's</font>

829
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,160
that's model based upon your your point

830
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,389
of view that's the power company this is

831
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power company trying to basically</font>

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,230
say please use less power oh no they're

833
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,350
really a saying please use the power

834
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,810
more efficiently but either way it's

835
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a push from that direction so I'm</font>

so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go take it from the chip</font>

839
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:18,470
level upwards not from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the multi</font>

840
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:20,960
megawatt but from the maybe 50 80

841
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,330
hundred watt device that's sitting on

842
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,010
them on the motherboard so I've got two

843
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,439
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who can talk about this</font>

844
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,760
from a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> point of view Michael</font>

845
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,020
can talk about it from Intel's point of

846
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,580
view although his expertise is in

847
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,930
cooling which is sort of interesting

848
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,639
because that's the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's caused</font>

849
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:39,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">by those chips and so from son who who</font>

850
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,090
can talk about this from actually a

851
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,379
bigger direction because you can talk

852
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from the system level point of</font>

853
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,190
view but Michael I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give you the</font>

854
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,139
microphone for a few minutes and just

855
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:51,020
let you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's</font>

856
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:56,250
happening at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lowest lowest level on</font>

857
00:30:51,020 --> 00:31:05,830
the chip side thank you slides in here

858
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:09,580
I mean did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other slide down okay</font>

859
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:12,939
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just talk then a lots going on</font>

860
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,490
obviously certainly an Intel where we

861
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,100
recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenges that are</font>

862
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:21,520
created by the capabilities that we

863
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:24,250
build into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the processors in</font>

864
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,350
that the one slide I had that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did want</font>

865
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:33,250
to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as a mini case study it</font>

866
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:35,980
showed in 2002 that there was excuse me

867
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,929
a data center that had a cluster a

868
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-performance computing cluster that</font>

869
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this cluster was on the top 500 list so</font>

870
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:45,760
if you're familiar with the HPC world

871
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,340
the top 500 supercomputers in there are

872
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,190
listed this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was I think in the top 20</font>

873
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:57,699
and if I remember right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had 25 racks</font>

874
00:31:51,190 --> 00:32:00,250
and 128 megawatts of power<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it Hunter</font>

875
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:05,830
20 kilowatts power cut my thousand wrong

876
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:09,010
there so 128 kilowatts power 25 racks

877
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:14,080
and used up quite a bit of space in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

878
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:17,379
data center so that was in 2002 2007 to

879
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,629
show the progress that same performance

880
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:25,120
that used to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> number 20 on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top 500</font>

881
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:30,490
list could be had by a single rack with

882
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:34,149
I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a full rack so it</font>

883
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,550
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even 40 servers it could</font>

884
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:39,640
accomplish the same number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of teraflops</font>

885
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:42,220
in just a single rack that rack consumed

886
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:45,580
21 kilowatts but just a single rack so

887
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:52,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue that we see is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that going from</font>

888
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:53,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that 128 down to 221 kilowatts a the</font>

889
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,020
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

890
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,270
21 kilowatts and in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it was</font>

891
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,780
five or six kilowatts Iraq is reasonably

892
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:04,570
easy to do but now the capabilities we

893
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,428
built into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that the progression on</font>

894
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,200
moore's law bringing in the more

895
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:11,510
powerful chips that use less power

896
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,480
you know we can get densities up to the

897
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:16,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">point where we're looking at single</font>

898
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,929
racks that are now on the top 500 list

899
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:23,840
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computing that the</font>

900
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:26,450
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I think that it has done is we</font>

901
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,178
have commoditized the server can

902
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,399
monetize the IT equipment and as we've

903
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:34,309
commoditized it we have uncommon 'it

904
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:37,219
eyes the building so that's I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

905
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:39,470
main challenge is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it used to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

906
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,419
bring in the servers or you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

907
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,990
mainframe and it was all a big deal and

908
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:46,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the non commodity part and</font>

909
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,610
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just put in a 12 inch raid</font>

910
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:51,139
raised floor throw a bunch of cracks

911
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,719
around the outside of the data center

912
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:57,199
you'd be done the room was the commodity

913
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,000
part and unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I gets</font>

914
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,070
actually good news but it does mean we

915
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,929
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shift our focus now we've</font>

916
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,779
commoditized the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers we can bring</font>

917
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:09,440
those in<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-density very inexpensive</font>

918
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:12,379
and then but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've done is focused</font>

919
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,629
now on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> facility to get to these 21</font>

920
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:17,509
kilowatt rocks it certainly takes a good

921
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:20,899
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering certainly you can do</font>

922
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,790
it but again now focusing on that side

923
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:26,690
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the equation is is going to be the</font>

924
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,889
key so to support that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

925
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,200
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

926
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:32,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">Green Grid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and climate savers certainly</font>

927
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:35,029
encourage everybody to look at those

928
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,649
both and understand what's going on in

929
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,800
both those organizations because they

930
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:42,379
can bring a lot of best practices and a

931
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,440
lot of standards that will help you in

932
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that challenge both at the server level</font>

933
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,500
and at the room level so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

934
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,139
ask you want to put you on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spot just</font>

935
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we get this on on on sort of the</font>

936
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:57,710
right level as much as we've got high

937
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,859
performance computing that has gone

938
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">sky-high with requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on on whether</font>

939
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:05,060
it be university or other data centers

940
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,730
to build that what's happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

941
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,160
power of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual CPU chip the actual</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">chip that your company produces what's</font>

944
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,680
today where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it going to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good</font>

945
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,530
question the power was ramping up

946
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,790
ramping up and if that ASHRAE chart did

947
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:27,350
everybody saw you know

948
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:29,450
with the increasing density and then

949
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:31,819
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an e in that chart that knee</font>

950
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:34,629
was actually when us and one of our

951
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,560
competitors decided to quit Jason

952
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:40,130
performance and start chasing

953
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,340
performance per watt so the power of the

954
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:45,230
CPU was going to just continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go up</font>

955
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,580
out of control and it got to the point

956
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:50,150
where it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much power</font>

957
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,860
too difficult to cool we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

958
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:55,940
needed to shift gears<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go performance</font>

959
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:59,570
per watt so that has changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that at</font>

960
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that peak I think single core cpu might</font>

have been in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred and thirty wat</font>

962
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:10,669
range today we have kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned the</font>

963
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:12,350
corner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can still buy 130 150</font>

965
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:17,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">in performance but most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are in</font>

966
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the 80 to 110 watts and and the reason</font>

00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:23,180
we've been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is is going</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple cores you know the real</font>

969
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,890
simple way to describe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you have</font>

970
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">two people working on a job and two</font>

working the nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> part about a quart</font>

975
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:45,560
doing that with the reduced clock speed

is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power consumed is far less</font>

00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:52,790
than half and so we can maintain Moore's

978
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,920
law it's a deviation of Moore's law but

979
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the performance base of the server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

980
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,130
know keep that moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead by adding</font>

981
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:05,150
more cores and spreading out the

982
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:07,780

thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you anything else no that'll do</font>

985
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,430
for you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment but but I'm going</font>

986
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go up at the level and now talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

987
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the systems because we talked about high</font>

988
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,400
performance computing taking you know

989
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:23,000
anywhere from four to five kilowatts

990
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:26,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Iraq to these days being in the 21 that</font>

991
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you quoted kilowatts per rack you just</font>

992
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,410
don't go out and bolt things together to

993
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,570
pull that<font color="#E5E5E5"> off some of us a bit about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sun</font>

994
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:34,569
and what it's doing in this face

995
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:47,109
so thanks Martin so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

996
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,640
lot of activity and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting technology innovation going</font>

998
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,460
on in the server industry which is

999
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,619
surprising considering that everybody

1000
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,809
considers it a commodity product and

1001
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:00,220
commodity industry and evidence

1002
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,410
commodity you would you would expect

1003
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most efficient</font>

1004
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:08,078
producers of the commodity that would

00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:10,019
end up becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dominant market</font>

1006
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,339
share vendors but it turns out that

1007
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:13,959
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of technology innovation</font>

1008
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:19,000
that's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the system level as</font>

1011
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:27,970
the data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know Mark talked</font>

1012
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:30,308
about the fact that in his presentation

1013
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:33,848
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know is part of one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of PGN</font>

1014
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:35,589
peonies incentive programs they had an

00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:37,779
incentive on energy-efficient equipment

1016
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:40,480
and the first partner they partnered

1017
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:44,200
with was sun microsystems one of one of

part of the PG&E incentive program as

1020
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:51,359
far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can believe mark that was</font>

1021
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,339
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever known</font>

1022
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,130
collaboration between a utility and a

1023
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:59,250
server vendor to put more energy

1024
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,869
efficient servers into data centers and

1025
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:04,240
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know get the gains that way</font>

1026
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:07,869
what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the server industry</font>

1027
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,058
is that just as Michael said you know in

1028
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:13,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> microprocessor industry the design</font>

1029
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:14,529
criterion has changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> from absolute draw</font>

1030
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,720
performance to delivering performance

1031
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:19,240
for what the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is going to</font>

1032
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,910
happen in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server industry and you</font>

1033
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,910
know the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of servers you buy you</font>

1034
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,730
should not only ask your vendors for

1035
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:29,288
benchmarks on performance how many

1036
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:33,339
transactions per second will it<font color="#E5E5E5"> run on</font>

1037
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:35,769
my favorite database how many web HTTP

1038
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:38,259
packets per second will it process etc

1039
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:41,109
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should also ask how much energy</font>

1040
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:44,109
it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn in doing it and so</font>

1041
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:45,910
optimizing the server design point for

1042
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:47,589
performance for what

1043
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,170
is is really what the game is all about

1044
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:53,288
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generation of servers in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of innovation happening the space of</font>

1047
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,579
better utilization of CPU capacity in

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,680
the server but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the cpu</font>

1049
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:06,059
that burns power in the server it's also

1050
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:09,098
memory it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk it's also I oh</font>

1051
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:12,339
it's also fans it's everything put

1052
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:15,789
together that that burns power inside a

1053
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:18,430
server servers that you know your

1057
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:29,380

1064
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:48,309
can burn as much as a kilowatt in one

1066
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:52,000

1067
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">those in iraq you're looking at a 40</font>

1068

1069
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,828
make servers good citizens of the data

1070
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,740
center it's all about building things

1071
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:04,839
that self calibrate their power draw you

1072
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,118
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard the oft-quoted statistic</font>

1073
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,369
that the average I tea shop will tell

1074
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,369
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the utilization on their</font>

1075
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:14,980
servers is pretty low<font color="#E5E5E5"> some numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1076
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:18,400
are quoted are like ten percent fifteen

1077
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,839
percent and it's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that is</font>

1078
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,819
driving the entire virtualization

1079
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:27,670
industry and if in fact you had servers

1080
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:30,700
that knew how heavily or how likely they

1081
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:33,039
were used because most ID shops will

1082
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,160
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> size their server farms for peak</font>

1083
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,650
capacity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the time you don't</font>

1084
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,899
actually operate at peak capacity you

1085
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,220
sighs them for Pete that cause that's

1086
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,740
what you get paid for you maintain

1087
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,558
availability for for what you know

1088
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,419
however once a year or a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a</font>

1089
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,869
year you might have peak demand but you

1090
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:54,670
sighs it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that level or that load</font>

1091
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:57,039
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you get paid for to</font>

1092
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:59,060
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up all the time but on the other</font>

1093
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">hand if you keep it up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font>

1094
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,080
I'm at peak capacity you're wasting

1095
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,509
energy because if your average

1096
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:08,660
utilization is in fact fifteen twenty

1097
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:11,120
thirty percent the typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> server power</font>

1098
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,279
curve is such that at fifteen percent

1099
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,930
utilization the average server is still

1100
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,060
burning about you know seventy percent

1101
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,770
of its peak power so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got lots of</font>

1102
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,990
servers at fifteen percent utilization

1103
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:25,370
each burning seventy percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its peak</font>

1104
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:27,520
power you're in trouble and so you need

1105
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:30,080
to look for servers that implement

1106
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,600
intelligent self-calibration of energy

1107
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,090
draw servers that recognize through

1108
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,069
smart firmware that you know the

1109
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,930
utilization level is fluctuating it's it

1110
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,030
was high during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day but it's low at</font>

1111
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,120
night so i am going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scale back my</font>

1112
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:45,890
energy draw because i am now in a period

1113
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,210
of low utilization so those are the

1114
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:50,240
kinds of innovations that you see coming

1115
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:53,990
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in the server industry over</font>

1116
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">time don't go away because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1117
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,279
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a question about the the</font>

1118
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,620
system's level stuff mark mentioned it

1119
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,650
earlier but he said he talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> +</font>

1120
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,870
power supplies but really just touched

1121
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:10,820
on it to a small amount in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

1122
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:13,040
level give us an idea son went through a

1123
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">very large rebuild of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its data centers</font>

1124
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,930
you've got rid of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of old equipment</font>

1125
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:20,240
so throw a number out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much</font>

1126
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,250
power could be wasted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by systems that</font>

1127
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,709
aren't the latest and greatest and where

1128
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:27,410
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that big change in the systems that</font>

00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:36,109
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power being used so a</font>

1133
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,060
great question power<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply is certainly</font>

1134
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,160
do make a difference because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the older</font>

1135
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:43,100
servers that you might still<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

1136
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,230
there in in operation probably a power

1137
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,880
supplies that are in the you know

1138
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,010
seventy percent efficiency range and

1139
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,060
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply you know what is a power</font>

1140
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,190
supply<font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially a small</font>

1141
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,520
transformer it takes a voltage that

1142
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:57,500
comes in off of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDU and then steps</font>

1143
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,020
it down to a voltage that's needed on

1144
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the motherboard and most transformers</font>

1145
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,740
whether it's you know the big gigantic

1146
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,259
transformer is that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see out in</font>

00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mechanical utility yards or</font>

1148
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,920
whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> UPS is in your data center</font>

1149
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,420
or even the

1150
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,430
the power supplies inside the server

1151
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,339
they have what's called an efficiency

1152
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:18,649
curve and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means is the less</font>

1153
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:20,540
you use them you know if you use them

1154
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,770
only at fifty percent of load you're

1155
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,259
actually using them at a lower

1156
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:27,290
efficiency point that if you use them at

1157
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,430
a higher efficiency load higher

1158
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,940
utilization you'll have a higher

1159
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:34,940
efficiency and so the new generation of

1160
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:37,609
servers are using power supplies that

1161
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,809
are 80 + & Sons case you know many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1162
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:41,690
our power supplies and our newer

1163
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:44,390
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually 90 plus and they</font>

1164
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:47,089
show a much much flatter and smoother

1165
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,710
and better efficiency curve than our

1166
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:50,960
older generation of servers so as an

1167
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:53,660
example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of our</font>

1170
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,140
energy efficiency and<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance for</font>

1171
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,869
what they were able to replace with<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1172
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:07,250
rack units high worth of equipment a

1173
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:09,950
competitor servers that delivered the

1174
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,869
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance in about 14 rack units</font>

1175
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:13,759
huibers of equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other words they</font>

1176
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:16,430
replaced seven older generation of

1177
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,230
servers with a single new generation

1178
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:22,339
server thereby gaining space

1179
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,109
improvements thereby gaining power

1180
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:26,690
improvements they cut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> their power</font>

1181
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:28,730
draw by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the factor of eighty percent or</font>

1182
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,410
something observed like that they cut

1183
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">down their space requirements and they</font>

1184
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:33,828
cut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> their daughters needed to</font>

1185
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:36,290
obviously install and maintain and<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font>

1186
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:38,420
those servers so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an example of</font>

1187
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:40,400
what the innovation the new innovation

1188
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:44,020
can save you great thank you very much

1189
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,750
so so this is we've now taken it through

1190
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:49,700
from the chip server side<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm now going</font>

1191
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:52,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">to just open it up for everybody but but</font>

1192
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,868
the first question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go to to</font>

1193
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:56,329
the three guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got on here that</font>

1194
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:57,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">are from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data center josh is</font>

1195
00:45:56,329 --> 00:46:01,040
already spoken we don't need to hear

1196
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:02,660
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> from him but but but you know I've</font>

1197
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">got I've got Christmas which and data at</font>

1198
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:07,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end there I've got John from crg</font>

1199
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">West and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Edmund from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix but i'll</font>

1200
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,910
hit the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> one first John you're up</font>

1201
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,899
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your eyebrows in data centers and</font>

1202
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,348
you're up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to her eyebrows and power</font>

1203
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,819
issues grab a mic and and and talk to us

1204
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:19,010
about what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with the</font>

1205
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:22,279
customers because this was the

1206
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,630
conversation about nice new servers and

1207
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,890
new technology

1208
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,300
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happening in the data</font>

1209
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,500
centers what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to tell the</font>

1210
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,550
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are shipping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment to</font>

1211
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,470
you right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now well first to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kick back</font>

1212
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:36,260
just a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk about a little</font>

1213
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:39,109
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the theory and I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

1214
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,450
a case study to present that thought and

1215
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the case study would be here in Milpitas</font>

1216
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:47,899
California since its approximately makes

1217
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,670
sense and mark is here from PG&E we

1218
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,980
found a property in milpitas that's a

1219
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">medium-sized property not the biggest</font>

1220
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,690
data center not the smallest it was left

1221
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,320
over from worldcom was originally

1222
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:03,350
designed as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dms 250-300 site about 70</font>

1223
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,850
watts a square foot originally we picked

1224
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:06,920
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the property and obviously the</font>

1225
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:08,690
mechanical electrical component was not

1226
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,630
going to be anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> near adequate to</font>

1227
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:14,300
meet the needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> of somewhere north of 200</font>

1228
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:17,090
watts of square foot so how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font>

1229
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:20,420
about looking at that site we knew that

1230
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:22,370
Silicon Valley<font color="#CCCCCC"> and PG&E was you know a</font>

1231
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">great place to start with a new concept</font>

1232
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,210
of how to build out a data center first

1233
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,800
you know to meet the mechanical

1234
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,630
electrical acquire requirement of

1235
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,940
bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that up to 200 watts of square</font>

1236
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,980
foot or more so we had a meeting

1237
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,200
together with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Pacific Gas and Electric</font>

1238
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,980
we had carrier who we had selected for

1239
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,270
our chilled water and cooling<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems</font>

1240
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,370
caterpillar who was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide us</font>

1241
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:44,870
our generators<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in fact a city of</font>

1242
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:47,089
milpitas to make sure that they were

1243
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:50,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware of how we were building out the</font>

1244
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:52,280
sites and as a group<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sat down in a</font>

1245
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,050
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about three days and beat out a</font>

1246
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,360
data center design that would bring

1247
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:58,190
together the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best practices of both</font>

1248
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:01,460
bringing the utility power into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site</font>

1249
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:03,350
as well as how we would best transform

1250
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to usable voltages and</font>

1251
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:07,100
currents and distribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> it throughout</font>

1252
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:10,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the facility and even more important</font>

1253
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:12,170
extract the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heat from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the building in a</font>

1254
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,120
closed loop chilled water system that

1255
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,950
would not harm the environment and in

1256
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,950
addition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the generators were</font>

1257
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:21,830
built at what we could do to comply with

1258
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:23,540
at least tier two requirements for the

1259

Clean Air Act in California and

1260
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:28,520
hopefully do better than that the

1261
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,750
building had great bones and you know

1262
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,300
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with that group of people</font>

1263
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,160
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> together we were able to come up</font>

1264
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,960
with a facility i think that met all of

1265
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,040
our expectations and in fact

1266
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,940
he don't got us a little bit of

1267
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,500
notoriety in the press so it was good so

1268
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,910
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that mean to customers it</font>

1269
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,650
means that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to the customers</font>

1270
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:49,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we can say we have a facility that</font>

1271
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:51,170
is capable of producing<font color="#CCCCCC"> an environment</font>

1272
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:55,400
that can deliver 200 watts of square

1273
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:58,099
foot we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enforce once you</font>

1274
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,680
come into that facility good practices

1275
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:02,300
within the facility as well strict use

1276
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:06,020
of blanking panels and high-density

1277
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,790
server configurations strict use of hot

1278
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,800
and cold aisles to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we're</font>

00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:11,240
not mixing hot air<font color="#E5E5E5"> love cold air and you</font>

1280
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know wasting the cooling that is so</font>

1281
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,950
precious in a facility like ours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1282
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:18,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that you know with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

1283
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:21,529
working together we have produced a you

1284
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:24,140
know pretty good cutting-edge facility

1285
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:25,790
and I hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> answers the question but</font>

1286
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,500
that's how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go about</font>

1287
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:29,990
designing the sites it has to be a

1288
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,359
cooperation between the utilities the

1289
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:34,009
city and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturers as well as</font>

1290
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:36,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center operator to make sure</font>

1291
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:39,560
that we deliver that infrastructure so

1292
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,970
that was what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did as far as the</font>

1293
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,950
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> is concerned what happened when</font>

1294
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:46,549
the first customer walked in brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

1295
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:48,500
servers or maybe a couple years old in

1296
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,930
the particular case of milpitas

1297
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,730
everybody who's coming in there is a

1298
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:55,149
fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> new company with a lot of</font>

1299
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:57,650
brand-new equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have not seen</font>

1300
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,960
myself anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i would consider</font>

1301
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:08,300
legacy hardware going into that facility

1302
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:09,619
oh boy the word legacy um yes I go to

1303
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,849
other people I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk here either</font>

1304
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:13,849
Chris or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edmund</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you want to talk</font>

1305
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:15,980
about legacy customers and and what you

1306
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:19,670
can do to motivate them into this this

1307
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:24,170
new utopia<font color="#E5E5E5"> of higher quality Colo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1308
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:27,349
better use of power the simple answer is

1309
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:31,250
charged more I guess we tell us more

1310
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:33,230
power rates are going up so I said power

1311
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:36,230
rates are going up in terms of you know

1312
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,940
almost every market so the way to you

1313
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,800
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously encourage people to go</font>

1314
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">green</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment that they bring</font>

1315
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the data center the easiest is</font>

1316
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:46,369
charging more they'll use less not

1317
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,830
necessarily the smartest business move

1318
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:49,470
but

1319
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:51,299
from an environmental factor I go back

1320
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,589
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> joshs point you know when you're</font>

1321
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,690
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you have a</font>

1322
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:56,570
100-megawatt data center trying to do

1323
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:59,340
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that generates that much power</font>

1324
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,630
environmentally friendly in a

00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-density area is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really</font>

1326
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:07,110
difficult so obviously the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing</font>

1327
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:08,390
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is besides smaller green</font>

1328
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:11,120
initiatives within the company is

1329
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:14,450
encourage the customers that come in to

1330
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:17,460
use more<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient things and through</font>

1331
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:19,439
power rates encourage them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to replace</font>

1332
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,880
the equipment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1333
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,220
less efficient with more efficient

1334
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,060
equipment as they move forward is it

1335
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:30,359
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know i don't i don't</font>

1336
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:32,250
have to answer to that ok edmond grab a

types of data center that you would

telecommunication data centers different

1349
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:07,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that when you build a data center one</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

1352
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,860

not available from the utility or detail

that's not want to deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:21,120
power at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a</font>

00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,680
very very important step doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your due</font>

1357
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,170
diligence now let's say that everything

1358
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,200
is hunky-dory everything you know powers

1359
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:30,120
their next thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do is make</font>

1360
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,310
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can put the number of</font>

generators to<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup your power because</font>

1362
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:37,830
that could be your limiting factor

1363
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:40,979
utility can pump as many as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> MBA or</font>

can't sell that power to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customer</font>

1368
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:52,050
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to make sure that your powers</font>

1369
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:54,240
backed up let's say you have enough

1370

generator capacity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup the power</font>

that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deliver now comes</font>

1372
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> communication communication between</font>

00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:04,950
the sales people that are going

1374
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:06,930
into these customers and users that you

1375
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,850
know they have X amount of power they

1376
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,649
need to talk to their facilities people

1377
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:14,610
they need to communicate so that they

1378
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:16,320
don't you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> over commit the power</font>

1379
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:18,600
that's available in that data center

1380
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:23,040
power and cooling so that's very very

1381
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:25,680
important and the way you know the way

1382
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:29,520
we do it or the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix does it is</font>

1383
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,470
that they have a very good way of

1384
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,040
communicating between their sales people

1385
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:37,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">and their facilities people also they</font>

1386
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,680
employ monitoring system so that they're

1387
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,750
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor the down to the branch</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about to exceed their allotted power</font>

1392
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:59,190
than they would get a notification or if

1393
00:53:55,020 --> 00:54:01,920
they inadvertently caused a short

1394

00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:21,810
customer that's very very important

1401
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,150
there are I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody have talked</font>

1402
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:26,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it throughout this whole</font>

1403
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:27,720
convention I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lot of</font>

1404
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:30,570
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were mentioned about how to</font>

1405
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:33,480
make a data center more efficient free

1406
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:35,160
cooling which isn't really free<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

1407
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> term free but it's not really free</font>

1408
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,620
because you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to pay for</font>

1409
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:43,440
running the fans the air handling units

1410
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,870
everything you gotta you gotta add extra

1411
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,480
piping and valves and all that and I

1412
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:50,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">think some you know some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1413
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,310
have done their presentation before have

1414
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:56,490
touched on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two types of free cooling</font>

1415
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:58,020
and that is the air air side frequently

1416
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:01,290
in the water side free cooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

1417
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:03,920
water is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the best solution so</font>

1418
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:06,810
those kind of things are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at</font>

1419
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,270
we're also looking at UPS system making

1420
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:12,360
sure that they're efficient you've got

1421
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:13,190
you know two types well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got several</font>

1422
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,369
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> UPS</font>

1423
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:21,770
but the two types of static UPS is the

1424
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">SDR type and the igbt type igbt UPS is</font>

1425
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:28,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">predominantly used because of the</font>

1426
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:29,300
efficiency you know on a wider range in

1427
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:32,660
other words you could you could operate

1428
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:35,869
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> igbt type UPS system half half its</font>

1429
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:39,230
load and you'd still be up in the 90s 92

1430
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:41,300
93 percent efficiency if you operated at

1431
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:44,329
a hundred percent actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1432
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,369
efficiency drops your best your best<font color="#E5E5E5"> bet</font>

1433
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:47,750
is seventy-five percent load because

1434
00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:49,880
they design them because most data

1435
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,079
centers do not operate their ups at a

1436
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,910
hundred percent the operating right

1437
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:54,349
around seventy-five percent so they they

1438
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,390
aim for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for the highest efficiency</font>

1439
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:58,579
that you will get about ninety-four

1440
00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:02,240
percent in some cases so little<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1441
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:06,140
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use occupancy sensors okay</font>

1442
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:09,729
and that way we don't have to burn power

1443
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:12,940
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need but</font>

1444
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:15,800
when you design a facility you can't

1445
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,810
design it for you know the lowest

1446
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,720
efficiency you have to design<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for the</font>

1447
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:24,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">worst-case scenario</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a very</font>

1448
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,328
important thing to remember let's say

1449
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that our efficiency is ninety percent or</font>

1450
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:32,780
I shouldn't say that but let's say that

1451
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:34,970
our overall<font color="#CCCCCC"> pua which stands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for power</font>

1452
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:37,220
utilization effectiveness everybody was

1453
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:39,560
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1.53</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think somebody</font>

1454
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:43,459
address uip did a study and they found

1455
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:47,828
it was 1.53 we're seeing higher than

1456
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it depends on the design the</font>

1457
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:52,520
configuration of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1458
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:55,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mechanical side by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1459
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:57,619
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types of mechanical</font>

1460
00:56:55,069 --> 00:56:59,240
system you have the water cool system

1461
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:02,359
you have the chilled water system which

1462
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,078
is pretty common and then you have the

1463
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:08,750
air-cooled condenser DX system<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1464
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,819
then you have the absorption<font color="#CCCCCC"> tight</font>

1465
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:12,500
chillers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you have many different</font>

1466
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:13,640
ways of<font color="#E5E5E5"> design a mechanical system and</font>

1467
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,560
your efficiency is going to be

1468
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,750
determined<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the type of mechanical</font>

1469
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,369
system that you use what type of

1470
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:22,099
mechanical system you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font>

1471
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:24,170
depends on your usage so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

1472
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:25,550
kind of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know is part of</font>

1473
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,460
that same equation that would determine

1474
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:30,390
your overall

1475
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:33,180
so to say that it's 1.53 you know you

1476
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:36,569
need to qualify that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that might be</font>

1477
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:38,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiency on a good day okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1478
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:41,310
in reality it's going to be a lot higher

1479
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:44,609
than that okay that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it is</font>

1480
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:46,020
in reality so so I'm gonna lead lead off

1481
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:47,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've heard from everybody here</font>

1482
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I we've talked about efficiency of</font>

1483
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,970
the chip<font color="#E5E5E5"> this efficiency</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the system</font>

1484
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,050
on the server side we didn't have switch

1485
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,399
and router guys up here on purpose

1486
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,720
because we did that two years ago and we

1487
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,550
thought it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to look at</font>

1488
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,290
the server side of it we talked about

1489
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:59,849
the data centers and from an engineering

1490
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:01,470
standpoint how efficient that can be and

1491
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:04,260
all that's great and that's as green as

1492
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:06,149
we can be inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the colo but that's as</font>

1493
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,430
efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we can go it's maximizing</font>

1494
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,710
use of space systems all the way down

1495
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,118
the line but now we're outside of the

1496
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:13,980
Colo and we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to generate</font>

1497
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:15,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">electricity to actually feed these</font>

1498
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,900
facilities so it falls back on guys like

1499
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,160
PG&E or other utilities so I actually

1500
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,330
need the audience to pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1501
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,060
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one because I need a raise of hands</font>

1502
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:26,009
if I were to tell you that if I provided

1503
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:29,220
green power to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data center now I</font>

1504
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:30,570
can't actually say that that exact a

1505
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,490
little bit electricity coming in my line

1506
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:35,940
is really produced from that windmill

1507
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:37,348
you know thousands of miles away we die

1508
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the electrons yes and now we all know</font>

1509
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:41,339
but let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I go to the utility</font>

1510
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,320
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying ten cents a kilowatt hour</font>

1511
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:45,270
for normal electricity but if I can

1512
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,250
produce get green electricity and have

1513
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:49,859
that guaranteed for a set period of time

1514
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:51,690
I'm paying 15 cents a kilowatt hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> I as</font>

1515
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,799
a data center operator and nobody else's

1516
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:55,589
data center operator is going to absorb

1517
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:58,500
that so by a raise of hands if I were to

1518
00:58:55,589 --> 00:59:00,720
sell you green power would you pay say a

1519
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:03,540
third more to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> provider like</font>

1520
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">terremark crg switch and data equinix to</font>

1521
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,160
provide you green power raise your hands

1522
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:13,919
now what does everybody think about that

1523
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">so all of us but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now all of us who's</font>

1524
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:21,420
driving a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prius oh we are really bad</font>

1525
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:23,520
geeks bad geeks bad games so here here

1526
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes situation that that we all want to</font>

1527
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,200
be efficient we want to be green but

1528
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,520
nobody wants to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so in the end</font>

1529
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,500
where do we end up there there's I

1530
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,900
actually moved from Florida<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live in</font>

1531
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,940
austin<font color="#CCCCCC"> now Austin Energy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really</font>

1533
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,690
green power they'll guarantee an

1534
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:42,000
internet exchange or data center

1535
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:43,440
provider green power rate higher than a

1536
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,780
normal rate but they'll guarantee that

rate for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years with no inflation that</font>

1538
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that in about four and a half</font>

1539
00:59:46,829 --> 00:59:50,579
years or so roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> just giving</font>

00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,290
inflation you'll equalize what you'd

1541
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">have for normal energy rates now of</font>

1542
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:55,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">course cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of cost of fuels are going</font>

1543
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,839
up so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end you probably be ahead</font>

1544
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:58,919
of the game but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is who's</font>

1545
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,029
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for that in the first four</font>

1546
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,320
and a half years nobody wants to eat

1547
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,910
that and they're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna charge</font>

1548
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,290
more to a customer actually provides it

1549
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:06,480
so I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was interesting but I</font>

1550
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:07,710
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lead over to mark and and see</font>

1551
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,970
what he<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks about that maybe that</font>

1552
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,440
maybe if they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

1553
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:12,270
future to put him on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spot of</font>

1554
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,420
bringing their green energy rates in

1555
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:17,640
input into into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same line as the</font>

1556
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:19,410
regular energy rates so that we as data

1557
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:25,770
center operators can provide you green

1558
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:27,810
power so in some ways I'm not the best

1559
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,150
person from the utility perspective to

1560
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:33,029
talk to you about this half of the

1561
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:35,970
generation that I delivered my customers

1562
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:37,440
comes from hydro we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't count that as</font>

1563
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:41,759
renewable and we don't count that as

1564
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,829
green I have regulatory mandate that by

1565
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,380
twenty ten twenty percent of the power I

1566
01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:48,829
deliver to my customers be renewable and

1567
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,690
we're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighteen something and</font>

1568
01:00:48,829 --> 01:00:53,780
frantically trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy into thermal</font>

01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:57,240
electric power plants down in the desert

1570
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:59,069
and other renewable sources outside of

1571
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,259
California<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we can't generate</font>

1572

1573
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:05,069
green power whether you like it or not

01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i think the regulatory community</font>

1575
01:01:05,069 --> 01:01:11,190
is going to tell your utility to do it

1576
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,259
and coal is no longer going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be king</font>

1577
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:15,480
and your rates are going to go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1578
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,369
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just point out a couple of quick</font>

as those utility assets get back up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see here in</font>

California we're already pretty

expensive there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talk of well</font>

1592
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,810
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want 10 megawatts from the</font>

stand up on the behalf of the utility

1599
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,850
are reasons where we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to</font>

1600
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:08,010
build your data center I have five

circuits in downtown San Francisco that

1602
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">are maxed that means if you want more</font>

01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:15,030
power and you're on that circuit I've

just give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> liquid cooling inside the</font>

data centers might may certainly be a

technology that gets you around some of

01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:47,610
the things but somebody sent me two

1618
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,500
photos last week and I wish I had them

1619
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:53,010
here the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of liquid cooling that you</font>

1620
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:56,130
all need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid it was a photo of some</font>

IT guys who had set up garden hoses<font color="#E5E5E5"> lik</font>

mechanical engineer and I know enough

1626
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:12,290
about electricity not to stand around

1627

that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of liquid cooling solutions</font>

01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:18,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll leave it at that hey guys we're</font>

1629
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:22,850
actually going to open up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to questions</font>

1630
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:24,830
so Randy come on up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurry up okay</font>

1631
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:26,600
if you're asking questions name

affiliation and total amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

use exactly point<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> megawatts house</font>

1637
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:44,299
that night<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one so one observation</font>

1638
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:46,580
that made during Josh's tour was all the

1639
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:50,540
buildings had good aerial shots and such

1640
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:52,100
they they had just wonderful resolution

1641
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:54,470
I couldn't quite see the details but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1642
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:56,299
think what i saw was none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them had</font>

1643
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:58,819
any solar shields is there any

1644
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:01,730
particular reason that's not seen as

1645
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:03,560
beneficial is his black body not a

1646
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:05,510
significant source of heat load you

1647
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,410
had've eventually have to remove in

1648
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:10,700
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the load from your servers</font>

1649
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:14,120
yeah that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weirdest question I've</font>

1650
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:17,089
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only a lover Tony better</font>

1651
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:19,130
though so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take I'll do it from my</font>

1652
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:20,990
building perspective I've got 120,000

1653
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:24,050
square foot roof plate that's that's

1654
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:26,180
number one I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three giant 16 meter</font>

1655
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:27,470
satellite dishes or 260 meters an 11

1656
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,390
meter dish surrounded by these giant

1657
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:31,040
balls on the roof and then how am I

1658
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to put something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

1659
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,120
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a Solar shield not</font>

1660
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:37,160
solar panel Solar shield like you said

1661
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:39,080
that is it going to blow away in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 200</font>

1662
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,089
mile an hour wind anybody want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand</font>

1663
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:43,640
around that when the wind blows so that

1664
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:45,410
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just Miami Chicago it still gets</font>

1665
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,390
windy it's still an issue I don't know I

1666
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think the the the solar heat</font>

1667
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:51,109
load on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual roof of the building</font>

1668
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:53,120
is much of an issue are you talking

1669
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:55,460
about this it's the entire thing right

1670
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,660
yeah so green screening it or something

1671
01:04:55,460 --> 01:05:00,500
is which trying to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I get a</font>

1672
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:02,089
that's a great color yeah so so the

1673
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer is people are doing it but</font>

1674
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:06,590
they're not doing it in the type of data

1675
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,590
centers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan if you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1676
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:11,870
very only example 1 i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

1677
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:15,440
you 200,000 square foot in sacramento

1678
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:18,049
california the data centers run by

1679
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:21,290
ragingwire which is a known cub well

1680
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:22,090
known company and they took the top of

1681
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:25,000
their roof

1682
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:26,350
that had no HVAC or any other equipment

1683
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,590
on it whatsoever so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about as clean</font>

1684
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:31,900
as can be put a white polymer coating on

1685
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:35,280
it drop the inside temperature on a I

1686
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:38,260
now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this off memory 32 foot</font>

1687
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,780
clear height data center and<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop the</font>

1688
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:42,790
inside temperature of that roof by just

1689
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:45,580
about 20 degrees that does make a

1690
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:49,180
difference absolutely so hey back which

1691
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:52,600
is more important nine to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months you</font>

1692
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:54,910
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> all be doing it right oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh sorry</font>

1693
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:57,069
oh they didn't do it by their own choice

1694
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,509
they had a state standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's</font>

1695
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:00,730
why they did it but they made a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good PR</font>

1696
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece out of it so sure so so we're</font>

1697
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:04,150
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about maybe but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a small</font>

1698
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,040
percent margin it's a big improvement

1699
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,630
when you're removing 10 megawatts of

1700
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,490
heat right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we all would recognize</font>

1701
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,680
that so it made a difference that the

1702
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:13,299
payback is the reduced utility bill so

1703
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,310
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a sexy technical solution is no</font>

1704
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:17,230
moving parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's not cool but it</font>

1705
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:19,900
did service like a railway<font color="#CCCCCC"> Paloma paint</font>

1706
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:22,840
sure that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it was sure so a roof</font>

1707
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:24,940
that could do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> honey that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great okay</font>

1708
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,620
I mean the other problem is you know I

1709
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,730
mean for all those buildings that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1710
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:30,190
were looking at when Josh was<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning</font>

1711
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">around most of them had you know a large</font>

1712
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:36,370
amount of heating ventilation stuff and

1713
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:38,290
generators on top plus you know roof

1714
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:39,520
right for communication equipment I mean

1715
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:42,340
when you start putting a whole bunch of

1716
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:44,020
antennas up their generators air

1717
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,730
exchangers I mean you're gonna write you

1718
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,009
know you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run out a an</font>

1719
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:51,850
efficient way to put a Solar shield over

1720
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:53,500
the building sure so good so so one

1721
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:54,790
other quick comment comment is that I

1722
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if you've looked at the</font>

1724
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:04,930

you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a problem at night oh I</font>

1753
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:13,440
for example has tons of antennas on the

1754
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:16,170
rooftop but many more inside units

1755
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:19,020
inside windows so collocations of radio

1756
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:20,970
facilities very reasonably easy to I

responsible for about point<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero one</font>

1761
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:35,460
megawatts but the point I wanted to make

1762
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,380
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the few Prius drivers</font>

1763
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:39,630
that raised his hands and response to

1764
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:41,340
your question is I didn't buy the prius

1765
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:44,220
to be green i bought the prius because

1766
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:46,380
my lx470 was consuming seven hundred

1767
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,910
dollars a month in gasoline and the

1768
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:50,100
payments on the prius were a little over

1769
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:51,210
five hundred dollars a month and it used

1770
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,400
one hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty dollars a month</font>

1771
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:54,840
worth of gasoline so when you add six

1772
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:56,759
those together you get six hundred and

1773
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:59,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">thirty dollars versus 700 + dollars a</font>

1774
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,320
month and gasoline that i was using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1775
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:04,620
suddenly you realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm driving</font>

1776
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:07,080
the prius because the prius was free and

1777
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:13,950
you probably get to drive on the diamond

1778
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:17,880
lane nope so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a question about</font>

1779
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:20,250
server form factor it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

1780
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:23,220
all sort of rushing towards higher and

1781
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:26,250
higher density in servers a few years

1782
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:30,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we don't seem to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any more</font>

1783
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I guess the power shortage in</font>

1784
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:35,639
most data centers has taken that

1785
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:39,149
pressure off but it seems like high

1786
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:40,460
density and making things small is its

1787
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:43,160
own value

1788
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:46,130
it seems like making servers smaller

1789
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:48,290
means that there's less manufacturing

1790
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:52,880
that goes into them if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

you that as a blade chassis that doesn't

01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:10,280
seem to be wildly more efficient than

1797
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:12,969
just stacking up one use so I'm curious

1798
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:16,160
what happened to the trend to making

1799
01:10:12,969 --> 01:10:20,780
servers smaller and more space-efficient

1800
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:23,360
the trend continues<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1801
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:25,489
our engineering compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> centers at Intel</font>

1802
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:28,339
where they actually model but the

01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:31,519

though is really really bad compared to

1809
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:56,960
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were just two years ago well</font>

1810
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:58,880
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it did it's it's I'm not sure</font>

1811
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:02,420
why is that bad compared where we were

two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago what do you mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by that</font>

1813
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:10,219
well because if we were at let's see a

01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:13,850
son be 1600 chassis right 16 blades in

1816
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:22,940
right that's a lot higher density than

1817
01:11:18,489 --> 01:11:24,799
slightly over one server / you I mean we

1818

seem to have fallen back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically</font>

01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:33,440
did well for one thing that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

1821
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:36,440
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooling how are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to</font>

1822
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:38,480
cool if you get much beyond these<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

1823
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:40,549
kilowatt racks then you have to start

1824
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,320
spending additional money I'm not

1825
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:44,210
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about filling whole racks with</font>

1826
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:49,790
these I'm saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you want</font>

1827
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:51,540
is say 16 servers why two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

1828
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:53,730
could I get that in a

1829
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:57,390
you package and now I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a</font>

1830
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:59,459
quarter rack that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a step backwards so</font>

1831
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:00,990
so let me try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that so I know</font>

1832
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:03,090
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> which product you're talking</font>

1833
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:06,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that that came out of my</font>

1834
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:07,770
division son and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

1835
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:11,700
things you ought to bear in mind is that

1836
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:13,050
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the server vendors</font>

1837
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,940
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server for a number of</font>

1838
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:17,030
things they designed them for in some

01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:20,070
cases performance in some cases

1840
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:21,960
performance but what in some cases you

1841
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:23,790
know reliability availability they would

1842
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:25,650
do it on everything if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1843
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">run a mission-critical database or</font>

1844
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:29,009
something on it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that you don't</font>

1845
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about energy efficiency in those</font>

types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of machines typical mid-range</font>

1847

1850
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,280
what's happened is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nature of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the applications that people run has</font>

1852
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:48,690
changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know in that particular</font>

1853
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:50,790
form factor where you had a single blade

1854
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:53,219
about you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> four inches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1855
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:55,410
that would fit in athletics and by the

1856
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:56,670
end of FedEx envelope exactly that was

1857
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:58,349
actually I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was probably</font>

1858
01:12:56,670 --> 01:13:01,890
still the smallest server ever built in

1859
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:05,040
the industry but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to get</font>

1860
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:09,720
16 gigabytes of DRAM for example in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1861
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:11,490
form factor or you know the new class of

1862
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,950
CPUs that are that are coming out that

1863
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:18,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">are dual core quad core you know 70</font>

1864
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:21,300
watts each you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 72 150 watts etc</font>

1865
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:23,640
memory dimms also generate a lot of heat

1866
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:26,370
in fact most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the servers that we make</font>

1867
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the amount of heat that's produced</font>

1868
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:30,480
by memory actually dwarfs the amount the

1869
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:33,540
amount of heat that's produced by the

1870
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:36,120
CPUs and so to get any reasonable

1871
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:38,040
application workloads that need a

1872
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,320
reasonable amount of memory maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1873
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">discs but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the machines you were</font>

1874
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,610
referring to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have weirdest classmates</font>

1875
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:47,280
and certainly you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people</font>

1876
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:50,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">that want disco blades and and so on so</font>

1877
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,320
forth so so really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trend towards</font>

1878
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:54,330
optimizing for performance for what

1879
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:57,299
hasn't changed and that's that's

1880
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:59,970
improving the servers will get in some

1881
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,890
cases somewhat physically bigger but

1882
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:03,390
they will get better certainly in

1883
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:05,850
performance will

1884
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:09,000
it also turns out that the more you

1885
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:11,280
enclose all sources of heat in a single

1886
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,540
chassis or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single cabinet the easier</font>

1887
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,639
it is from a cooling efficiency

1888
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:16,920
perspective to cool them because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1889
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,930
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's not just a bunch of 1u</font>

1890
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:21,390
servers that are sucking in air from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1891
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:24,570
front individually 40 of them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq</font>

1892
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:27,540
and exhausting air individually outside

1893
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:29,219
and into the hot<font color="#CCCCCC"> aisle they are now that</font>

1894
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:32,040
the cooling is now much more integrally

1895
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:34,470
designed the heat sinks are connected

1896
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,300
their network there you know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1897
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,800
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> liquid cooling coming</font>

1898
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,000
directly into the server racks and

1899
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,710
server cabinets it's a lot more

1900
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,040
efficient to do that if you designed for

1901
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:45,840
high density<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one other comment about</font>

1902
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:49,170
form factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would make it is if you go</font>

1903
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,780
look at the Sun container and count the

1904
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:53,400
number of fans in there and determine

1905
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:56,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much fan power is being used in that</font>

1906
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:58,170
then go look how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many fans and how much</font>

1907
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,900
been powered be used if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

1908
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:03,950
many servers all one you you know in

1909
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:06,929
racks right so that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiency with</font>

1910
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:09,840
some of the new form factors coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1911
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:12,870
in terms of reducing fan power better

1912
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,490
application of power supplies is helping

1913
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:15,960
the performance I want for blade chassis

1914
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:17,730
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not arguing against pledge has</font>

1915
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:20,720
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are marketing for blade chassis as</font>

1916
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:22,919
I'm arguing for making<font color="#E5E5E5"> them smaller so</font>

1917
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,710
Michael can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just tell us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in as</font>

1918
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:28,440
classic one you or to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> sh a see how</font>

1919
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:31,740
much power is being used by the fans it

1920
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:35,160
varies by manufacturer but we've been

1921
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:38,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about this and it could be</font>

1922
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:41,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">roughly 40 watts and some of some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

1923
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:44,340
platforms when they're ramped up at top

1924
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,200
speed I've seen reports in a to you that

1925
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:50,460
you could get up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred watts of</font>

1926
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:54,230
fan power in in a chassis it's a lot of

1927
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:54,230
power just on the fans<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright let's</font>

1928
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:02,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so now it's a very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1929
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:03,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I didn't ask Michael the other</font>

1930
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:07,860
question so a classic one you or to you

1931
01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:10,080
and I in your case<font color="#E5E5E5"> a let's say a dual</font>

1932
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:11,759
dual cpu intel solution how much how

1933
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,040
many watts does an average one<font color="#CCCCCC"> your to</font>

1934
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,869
you server take well again we have to

1935
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:21,780
look at what's inside of it right i mean

1936
01:16:15,869 --> 01:16:24,269
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> jumped but you know we're looking at</font>

1937
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:27,570
i was looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some trend data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1938
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:31,020
earlier in the weekend we've got some

1939
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:33,630
well monitored servers you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1940
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:35,969
energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the end Engine and</font>

1941
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:39,869
compute and they're drawing actually

1942
01:16:35,969 --> 01:16:42,810
about 250 to 300 watts per so if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1943
01:16:39,869 --> 01:16:45,690
sort do a processor right so let's say

1944
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:48,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">300 watts for a 1u server and 30 watts</font>

1945
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:49,619
for the fans that's ten percent yeah how

1946
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:53,009
much does it Josh how much do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you spend</font>

1947
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:55,320
on electricity a year millions asked it

1948
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:57,929
just leave it at millions so so ten

1949
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,969
percent of millions is it makes a

1950
01:16:57,929 --> 01:17:02,190
difference it's not ten percent of

1951
01:16:59,969 --> 01:17:05,250
millions because what happens if there's

1952
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:07,019
a power supply right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's if it's</font>

1953
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:09,060
a climate savers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're ninety</font>

1954
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:10,619
percent that's great but if you're at

1955
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,760
seventy percent eighty percent you got

1956
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:15,630
it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got that inefficiency</font>

1957
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,130
then you've got the inefficiency of you

1958
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:18,929
know the power distribution from the

1959
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:21,960

1960
01:17:18,929 --> 01:17:25,710
yeah cool it you have to cool it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1961
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean always it isn't insignificant I</font>

1962
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:29,730
think it's the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's being</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">making it is small but it's not</font>

1964
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:35,190
insignificant i mean really does convert

1965
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:37,469
to real dollars let's go to a bride

1966
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:39,780
nixon affiliates a very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

1967
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:46,139
power responsible for probably 0 point 0

1968
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:48,480
1 or less kilowatts the the whole system

1969
01:17:46,139 --> 01:17:52,440
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where there are other</font>

1970
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:55,530
places would be including transmission

1971
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:58,019
systems power transmission and the kind

1972
01:17:55,530 --> 01:18:02,820
of power that's being used for power

1973
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:05,219
supplies so AC vs DC and going off grid

1974
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:05,679
avoiding the thirty percent loss and

1975
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:09,280
power

1976
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:11,860
mission any thoughts to the kinds of

1977
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,840
off-grid solutions that allow you to

1978
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:18,339
avoid even having the backup systems in

1979
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:20,830
place such as going nuclear allows for a

1980
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:23,410
lot of growth<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term and avoids</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1981
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:26,950
thirty percent and going to all DC

1982
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:29,800
rather than AC for the servers and the

1983
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:31,360
distribution systems so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to that from I'm start I'm gonna start</font>

01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:56,590
in and trying to deal with DC I'm

1997
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,509
terrified now it's great because there's

1998
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:00,610
it is easier there is cooling benefits

1999
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:01,840
there's no question but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to all</font>

2000
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:04,150
sudden start worrying about voltage drop

2001
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,380
issues that are really get obscene when

2002
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:06,790
you start dealing with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

2003
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:07,960
environment and because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bunch</font>

2004

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more it's easier to cool so</font>

2008

around with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that that again we</font>

2010
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,800
end up relying on the vendors as a

carrier neutral Colo tom tom has a

2012

different story here with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon he can</font>

2013
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:29,200
choose you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50,000 servers across</font>

thing well that's you can get really

2016
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:34,600
efficient that way but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got you</font>

2017
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:36,519
know a thousand servers here a bunch of

stuff different<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything it gets</font>

2021
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:43,630
really difficult but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

2022
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:45,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the thirty percent drop yeah I</font>

know I he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was he was bouncing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

2024
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,180
actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to insert a a</font>

2025
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:51,040
scheduling thing we have actually hit

2026
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:52,750
four o'clock I don't want to interrupt

2027
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,040
the conversation but I did want to let

2028
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:57,220
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that we do have a half-hour</font>

2029
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:59,710
break starting now so feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to stay</font>

2030
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:04,270
and listen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions or grab</font>

2031
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:06,400
your break time to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so so yeah</font>

2032
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:08,620
there seems to be this rumor that there

2033
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,259
are huge losses and utility distribution

2034
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:13,630
and transmission systems there's huge

2035
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:17,350
losses when I put 10 units of fossil

2036
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:18,659
fuel based energy into a power plant I

2037
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:21,809
get about four

2038
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:24,150
out that's a huge loss but I've got

2039
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:25,949
hydro I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> son I've got wind I've</font>

2040
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,900
got a lot of other systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

2041
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:29,999
generating my power so if you're

2042
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:33,959
pointing out the loss in a fossil fuel

2043
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:36,659
power plant I agree transmission<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4%</font>

2044
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:39,030
folks I move power around interstate and

2045
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:41,129
our transmission losses are four percent

2046
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:43,559
i can move power down here from the

2047
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:46,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">pacific northwest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe at five or six</font>

2048
01:20:43,559 --> 01:20:50,280
percent losses not thirty percent never

2049
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:53,639
has been never will be thank you dude<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

2050
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:56,849
wanted to comment on DC powered servers

2051
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:58,949
if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then yeah it Lawrence</font>

2052
01:20:56,849 --> 01:21:01,559
Berkeley National Lab just recently

2053
01:20:58,949 --> 01:21:04,499
completed a demonstration project which

2054
01:21:01,559 --> 01:21:06,059
we were happy to be part of and when you

2055
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:09,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it talks about the benefit</font>

2056
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:12,539
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC powered servers interesting in</font>

2057
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:14,130
there it showed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could get from</font>

2058
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:15,749
from sorry I guess I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this word but from a legacy design</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what else was very very</font>

2063
01:21:24,599 --> 01:21:29,610
interesting is if you go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> reread</font>

2064
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:33,900
the report you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font>

2066
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:39,388
just using high efficiency standard

2067
01:21:35,999 --> 01:21:41,188
design stuff right i mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

2068
01:21:39,389 --> 01:21:43,769
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody's used to you know the</font>

2069
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:45,630
208 volt power is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

twenty three percent improvement over

2071
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:51,539
the legacy power so that the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

2072
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:53,518
look at DC power look at the 400 volt AC

2073
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:56,280
power as an option look at standard

2074
01:21:53,519 --> 01:21:58,469
power as an option but in any case make

2075
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:01,199
sure you get the high efficiency

2076
01:21:58,469 --> 01:22:04,079
components from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> utility right to the</font>

server<font color="#E5E5E5"> junk good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to say</font>

2078
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,459
two quick things first even if you're

2079
01:22:06,599 --> 01:22:10,590
using DC power remember there's still a

2080
01:22:08,459 --> 01:22:12,659
rectifier in between your AC feed and

2081
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:14,070
distributing it on a BD FB so you're

2082
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:15,388
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the loss it's just a matter</font>

2083
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:17,820
whether it's on the server or whether

2084
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:20,219
it's through the rectifiers and the

2085
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:22,739
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that when we design data</font>

2086
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:24,900
centers and you know like the map is one

2087
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:25,860
example and other examples that we can

2088
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,110
look at

2089
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,880
the higher the<font color="#E5E5E5"> voltage the easier to</font>

2090
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:32,369
distribution if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,679

2092
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:36,869
the utility generally they delivered at

2093
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:38,489
34 dot five or thirty four thousand five

2094
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:40,559
hundred volts and then through a large

2095
01:22:38,489 --> 01:22:42,209
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> will carry it at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 41-60 and</font>

2096
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,239
break it down we have to we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

2097
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:47,100
usually go for 80 unless we're very in

the railroads failed because they

thought that they were in the railroad

01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:24,060
we're in the computing business and

we've talked not at all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> managing</font>

we're on is not really needed this next

2121
01:23:35,639 --> 01:23:41,100

2124
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:48,239
it'll be nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear a little bit about</font>

2125
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:51,090
that by the way too many megawatts to

2126
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:53,489
mention i mean i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

2127
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:55,590

bright lights here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the valley are</font>

2129
01:23:55,590 --> 01:24:00,810
working on that problem which is ok I

2130
01:23:58,949 --> 01:24:03,599
virtualized I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a thousand</font>

2131
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:06,840
servers down to 200 but I'm still sized

2132
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:08,429
for double my average load and they want

2133
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,739
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to shut those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers off</font>

2134
01:24:08,429 --> 01:24:12,389
with the confidence that you need that

2135
01:24:10,739 --> 01:24:13,980
they'll come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on when the when the</font>

2136
01:24:12,389 --> 01:24:16,110
loading comes back up so I think that's

2137
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:18,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization 2.0 if you will</font>

2138
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:20,309
and and Tom real quick we we we

2139
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:21,599
specifically Martin<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I were debating</font>

2140
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:23,790
what to do on this panel and we

2141
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,469
specifically kept virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

2142
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:27,150
it we know it's hot right now but we

2143
01:24:25,469 --> 01:24:29,190
wanted to get to these tough points and

2144
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:30,809
then at our we're going to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

2145
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:33,030
panel here coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up again and we'll do</font>

2146
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:34,860
we'll start going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into you know</font>

2147
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:36,509
efficiencies for virtualization chipset

2148
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:37,769
designs that get even deeper more liquid

2149
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:39,660
cooling stuff like that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

2150
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:41,010
what I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more not how</font>

2151
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:42,750
you slice up the servers which

2152
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:44,640
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps you with but rather</font>

2153
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:47,490
how you shift load which you know

2154
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:49,410
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> your dishwasher in the at night</font>

2155
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:52,019
time rather than during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day helps</font>

2156
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:53,639
with so<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it well your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ship ting load</font>

2157
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,870
within a data center so actually dealing

2158
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,340
with data center switching and how you

2159
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:57,870
handle big loads like that that is

2160
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:01,560
definitely a big topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to cover</font>

2161
01:24:57,870 --> 01:25:02,820
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I agree some data centers</font>

2162
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,490
thinking about thermal energy storage

2163
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:08,809
now as you know let's build the chilled

2164
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:08,809
water at<font color="#CCCCCC"> night when it's cheaper</font>

2165
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:16,710
services we use maybe a quarter of a

2166
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:18,510
megawatt I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

2167
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:20,610
the fan issue because really<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you're</font>

2168
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:22,980
getting down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the micro design and</font>

2169
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:25,259
when you consider the fan you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

2170
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:28,230
wafer that's maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> two centimeters</font>

2171
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:31,920
square that's generating most of the

2172
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:34,169
heat in a in a server and you need to

2173
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,090
move that heat out of the server and the

2174
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:37,860
most efficient way to do that is problem

2175
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:39,870
might be with some type of a of a pipe

2176
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:41,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">liquid-liquid pipe that you like you see</font>

2177
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:43,140
on some of the laptops but eventually

2178
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:45,630
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a fan de to get it</font>

2179
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of the box and so what you wind up</font>

2180
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:50,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">with is the server designer just wants</font>

2181
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:53,280
to get that heat away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chip and</font>

2182
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:55,800
when you start stacking these things up

2183
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,360
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iraq depending if you get different</font>

2184
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:01,860
brands of servers and they don't think

2185
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:05,040
on a on a larger scale to move all of

2186
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:07,710
this hot air in a particular move all

2187
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:09,780
this heat in a particular direction you

2188
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:12,150
now have hot air mixing with cold air

2189
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:14,040
and what have you even<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to the</font>

2190
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:15,570
rack is it going into to post<font color="#CCCCCC"> roxy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

2191
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:18,210
into for post-rock what's that what's

2192
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:20,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air flow in the facility so I think</font>

2193
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:23,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">really in order to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address the fan issue</font>

2194
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:27,120
in a in a realistic manner you've got to

2195
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:30,060
to get the server designers to come up

2196
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:32,519
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a uniform way of okay we're going</font>

2197
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:35,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take cold air in here and push it out</font>

2198
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,290
here and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see any any</font>

2199
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:39,989
industry-wide thing with the different

2200
01:26:37,290 --> 01:26:42,960
server manufacturers doing that as

2201
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:44,669
as as they go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some devices move it</font>

2202
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,780
side to side some front to back and what

2203
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:47,730
have you so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something</font>

2204
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:50,070
that from an industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> standpoint if the</font>

2205
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:53,459
various makers of this gear could get

2206
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:54,659
together and work with the HVAC people

2207
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:57,749
and everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

2208
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:59,909
uniform specification of this is the way

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move the heat within a</font>

minutes left because we are digging<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

the break so we're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">comments really everybody more than</font>

2215
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:11,690
answer them as quick as we can because

2216
01:27:09,749 --> 01:27:14,550
we are we are definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time now</font>

2217
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:16,768
you were waiting a little longer so all

2218
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:20,190
right my name is Gilbert<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gong from box</font>

2219
01:27:16,769 --> 01:27:24,690
net very small power usage I just wanted

2220
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:26,848
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on your question about if the</font>

2221
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:29,730
pricing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> pi was going to go up fifty</font>

2222
01:27:26,849 --> 01:27:33,119
percent for green power if we pay and I

2223
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:37,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">think part of the hesitation there is</font>

2224
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:41,789
that when kolos are charging against the

2225
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:44,400
breaker amp and not the usage and you

2226
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:46,380
know there's there's a difference

2227
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,960
between passing through the costs you

2228
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:51,300
know PG&E we know as a regulated utility

2229
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,429
has to charge us<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to how much it</font>

2230
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:55,559
actually costs them I think if it was

2231
01:27:53,429 --> 01:27:58,139
clear that the amount we were paying was

2232
01:27:55,559 --> 01:28:00,300
actually the differential that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

2233
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:02,130
paid to the utility we probably would be

2234
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:04,679
a lot more willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay that</font>

2235
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:06,210
differential so that that comes into my

2236
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:08,730
presentation earlier in the model war

2237
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:10,139
and in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's business so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we know</font>

2238
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:12,360
one model will win out over the other or

2239
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:13,349
they'll equalize or not and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

2240
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:16,650
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is going to play</font>

2241
01:28:13,349 --> 01:28:19,079
itself out pretty well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Robert anger</font>

2242
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:21,539
narrow step during the initial overview

2243
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:23,210
attention was paid to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> colocation</font>

2244
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:26,579
centers that were adjacent to

2245
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:29,039
transmission substations and in some

2246
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:31,920
cases adjacent to communications rights

2247
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:34,309
away there wasn't any mention of colo

2248
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,690
centers that were located adjacent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2249
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:42,420
industries that could use make use of

2250
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:44,830
the waste heat<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm yeah pretty pretty</font>

2251
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:47,080
low-grade waste heat by an engineer

2252
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:49,840
I mean you could put green houses around

2253
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:54,780
them they do that around nuclear power

2254
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:57,640
plants and<font color="#E5E5E5"> France let me just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font>

2255
01:28:54,780 --> 01:29:01,570
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

2256
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:05,080
places like that are there have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

2257
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:07,870
heard of bagasse the gas is a way of

2258
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:11,320
generating electricity from sugarcane

2259
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:14,140
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay instead of throwing away</font>

2260
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:17,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">calling it some to some landfill they</font>

2261
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:21,930
would pulverize it they would burn it

2262
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:25,150
and make steam to generate electricity

2263
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:27,220
the department<font color="#E5E5E5"> of energy has done many</font>

2264
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:30,269
studies on that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact there's a study</font>

2265
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:33,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read where they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

2266
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:35,680
provide power for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sugar mill and for</font>

2267
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:37,719
the whole town around it so if you have

2268
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:40,090
a data center next to a big-ass facility

2269
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:42,700
that would work but how many of those

2270
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:44,320
places do we have around here that

2271
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,000
probably probably have something to say

2272
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:48,639
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I used to work for the coach n</font>

2273
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,410
in New Jersey<font color="#CCCCCC"> and New Jersey has a lot</font>

2274
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,750
of landfills and we're able to produce

2275
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:56,470
enough literacy from small laugh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh for</font>

2276
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:59,500
3,000 homes and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

2277
01:29:56,470 --> 01:30:02,080
if I he was very efficient cleans up the

2278
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:04,870
green air I mean no methane tous les

2279
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:07,320
baer fun environment and it was very

2280
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:10,030
efficient and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have enough</font>

2281
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:12,160
you know landfills around the country we

2282
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:15,250
really could do that well then get<font color="#E5E5E5"> mixed</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rilla tracks other stuff it's is a</font>

2284
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:19,840
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to think about for the</font>

2285
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:21,370
future yeah so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wrap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

2286
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,350

01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:40,599
rex renewable energy credits if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

2294
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">at native energy you can go find some</font>

2295
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:46,440
biomass projects we've got to wrap it
