1
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:10,500
so our next speaker is a Richard

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,990
steinberger from sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> steenburgen from</font>

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,219
n layer and he will address<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 10 gig</font>

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,219
pluggable technology

5
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:36,100
oh this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old version</font>

6
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,500
I send in the update it's on the website

7
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,980
yes Valerie do you have it

8
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,340
I don't I thought it was

9
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,519
so interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bergen within layer</font>

10
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:49,069
communications I have to start by

11
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,750
thanking Todd for the donation of the

12
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,640
the slide set if I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention it at</font>

13
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,360
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> two times in a nod my earnest</font>

14
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,790
account mysteriously breaks so Thank You

15
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Todd for the donation of the slide set I</font>

16
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,810
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of waffled back and forth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here for</font>

17
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,330
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit as to whether to talk about</font>

18
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:12,140
all 10 gig or 10 gige the the title is

19
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,640
10 gige just because there's there's a

20
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,470
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> portion of it right didn't feel</font>

21
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">like really talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire</font>

22
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">spectrum but a lot of this applies to 10</font>

23
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,090
gig in general so assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> 192 fibre</font>

24
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:27,619
channel various other other 10 gig

25
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,650
technologies so quick review what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

26
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,850
pluggable what we're talking about

27
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,530
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about those</font>

28
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,650
little transceivers that you stick into

29
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,590
routers that are used to transmit and

30
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,569
receive a signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for anyone that</font>

31
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,000
doesn't know they're there are little

32
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,890
hot swappable things they're capable of

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,700
operating many different types of

34
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,380
physical media you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can drive</font>

35
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,000
copper with them you can drive signals

36
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,700
over many distances of multimode

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,680
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of multimode single mode</font>

38
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,570
you can do 10 40 80<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometers you can</font>

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,900
do 100 there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are making</font>

40
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,820
hundred 20 kilometer optics there

41
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,269
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> standardization of these</font>

42
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">things so that you can interchange them</font>

43
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,019
among the vendors well actually the

44
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,450
standardization<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so that the vendors</font>

45
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,859
can interchange them among themselves

46
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,738
not so that you can do it but we'll get

47
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:21,200
to that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefits of using pluggable</font>

48
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,179
basically there's there's a bunch of

49
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,310
technical benefits and that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

50
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,710
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> accommodate whatever media type</font>

51
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,160
you want so when you start buying a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

52
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">density card if you buy a 48 port card</font>

53
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,350
you don't have to buy 48 of a short

54
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,780
reach 48 of a long reach anything like

55
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,060
that you can mix and match with whatever

56
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,919
whatever type you want and the other

57
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,670
major technical benefit is the easy

58
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,740
replacement

59
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,360
opponent failures so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how</font>

60
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here have ever worked with</font>

61
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,340
fixed optic cards where one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ports</font>

62
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,360
goes bad but I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them where</font>

63
00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:00,630
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports eventually go bad so it's</font>

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,090
a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> help and then obviously there's</font>

65
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,780
the financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> benefits and that there's</font>

66
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,640
a pay as you populate model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

67
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,890
start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> only needing five ports in a</font>

68
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,710
given pop you're still going to buy and

69
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,450
deploy a 48 port card maybe or whatever

70
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,370
the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be and in the case of 10</font>

71
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,130
gig you may only need one pour it on a

72
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,370
four port card something like that the

73
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,680
the plug levels are reusable so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

74
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,930
upgrade your your cards you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

75
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,150
might have started out at the one gig

76
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,670
level with an eight port sfp card and

77
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,590
became a 16 that became a 32 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

78
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,570
became a 48 and you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be using</font>

79
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">those same pluggable across different</font>

80
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,760
systems so a lot of your investment is

81
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,430
protected and also the the cards are

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,990
reusable so say for example you were

83
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,610
using now<font color="#CCCCCC"> one one particular media type</font>

84
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,170
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know something comes along</font>

85
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,120
there's a newer standard better standard

86
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,380
you just swap<font color="#E5E5E5"> out your optics and now</font>

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,930
you don't have to reinvest in the cards

88
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,960
and obviously anytime you have

89
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,440
standardization you have competition and

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,989
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring the cost down so</font>

91
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,730
pluggable<font color="#CCCCCC"> zar standardized obviously for</font>

92
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,380
good reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so you can have</font>

93
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,740
interchangeable components and mass

94
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,840
production<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the standardization is</font>

95
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,820
achieved through a vendor MSA which

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,469
stands for a multi-source agreement and

97
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,170
it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a group of vendors</font>

98
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,670
to get together and say this is the

99
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,020
specification of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

100
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,250
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make and we're going to sell</font>

101
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,349
this to multiple vendors and then

102
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,990
multiple the you know hardware router

103
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and network switching vendors are able</font>

104
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,690
to buy their pluggable from multiple

105
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,940
sources and typically the specifications

106
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,820
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this are published under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

faces serial interfaces etc power why

113
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:58,340
not so a quick review on first

114
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:01,530
generation pluggable tech

115
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,690
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started out in Ethernet land</font>

116
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,429
with the G<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick which was actually</font>

117
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally designed for fibre channel it</font>

118
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,750
had nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with ethernet at all</font>

119
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:13,969
but the ethernet people said hey it's a

120
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:19,590
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it only requires point2</font>

121
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:22,410
gigabits more to signal our to signal

122
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,479
our one gig and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that quickly became</font>

123
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">popular and that was very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

124
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,880
on gear from you know 1998 to around

125
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,530
2002 and it's still used today there's

126
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,940
nothing wrong with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's just a little</font>

127
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:38,880
bit larger around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 26 / started</font>

128
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:43,259
shipping the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sfp which is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a smaller</font>

129
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:46,919
version and it actually does a couple

130
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,660
things it's multi rate so you can you

131
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,340
can use the same pluggable for one gig

132
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,430
to Gig fibre channel you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

133
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,469
same pluggable in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethernet and now these</font>

134
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,750
days it's almost impossible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

135
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can't also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take the same</font>

136
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,310
pluggable put it in an OC 48 and run it

137
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:04,229
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and these days for a few</font>

138
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,479
dollars more you can get the ones that

139
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,430
are also do<font color="#CCCCCC"> four gig fibre channel and</font>

140
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,260
you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethernet care they could do</font>

141
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,599
for Giggy thur net over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same type of</font>

142
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:17,729

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:23,430
about sfp is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> first introduced the</font>

145
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,409
digital optical monitoring which talked

146
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,419
about more later but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very handy and</font>

147
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:30,210
these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> their current standard for</font>

148
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:36,150
one gig you're going to see a 48 sfp

149
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:41,760
card density so back in the one gig one

150
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:43,860
gig e even going up to 20 c 48 you only

151
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,260
had a few choices that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> g pick recipe</font>

152
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,570
and for the most part it was sfp and

153
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,069
that was that you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with</font>

154
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,730
10 gig is there's a whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

155
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">choices out there and some of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

156
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,459
more viable than others but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

157
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,819
technically there's one two three<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

158
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:02,660
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seven of them some of them are</font>

159
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,370
less less well-known than others but

160
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,889
each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> has its own back-end design and</font>

161
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,179
each one has its own

162
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:14,059
and cons lots of choices to pick from

163
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:16,488
and a lot of the problem in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operator</font>

164
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:17,839
community is figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what they want</font>

165
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,519
to what kind of equipment they want to

166
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,529
buy what kind of optics they want to

167
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">support how they want to manage sparing</font>

168
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,389
how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to manage the different</font>

169
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:29,359
features and<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantages and</font>

170
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:32,809
disadvantages of the optics so I have a

171
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:34,399
little thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anyone reads like in</font>

172
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:37,579
gadgets the little thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they use</font>

173
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,989
to compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellphone sizes I almost left</font>

174
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:40,849
the iphone in for reference but there

175
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:43,759
was a limited number of entries you

176
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,889
could put in so this kind of gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

177
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,929
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of what the physical sizes of</font>

178
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,359
these things and I left off some because

179
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:51,529
you know they're either too big or there

180
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:53,419
was a limited number you could put in

181
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,850
but you kind of see in blue that's

182
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:57,799
impact the X to the colors are a little

183
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,290
off but the middle orange yellow thing

184
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,569
there's is the classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeevika the xfp</font>

185
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,899
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sfp so it kind of gives you</font>

186
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:08,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">an idea what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're looking at size wise</font>

187
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:10,309
so a quick review of the different

188
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,139
technologies out there the very first

189
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:15,469
thing for 10 gig was called the 300

190
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:17,029
Pendennis a was very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

191
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:21,529
actually wasn't even a pluggable it was

192
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:25,369
a snap-on connector it drew a lot of

193
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:27,949
power it had a very high density low

194
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:30,369
speed interface which was was key for

195
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:33,378
working with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology at the time</font>

196
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:34,939
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that kind of a format is</font>

197
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,949
suited to a first generation technology

198
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">or you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making use of the existing bus</font>

199
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,029
capacity that you have the existing

200
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:43,189
interface speeds and in fact we're still

201
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:46,669
seeing the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing used today</font>

202
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:48,738
for 40 gig 300 penned MSA but if you're

203
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:52,009
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these for 10 gig very very</font>

204
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:56,839
sorry I have a pile of these in my

205
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:59,239
basement if anyone wants them so the

206
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">next standard and probably one of the</font>

207
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:06,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most different the most popular or</font>

209
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,529
this was an MSA founded in 2001 it

215
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,630
power classes we'll talk more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:31,110
later but in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of maximum draw those</font>

217

go into more detail on this is just a

221
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,660
quick overview it's very widely deployed

222
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,150
and it has a very wide selection of

223
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,810
exotic optics what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by exotic</font>

224
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:55,709
optics are 80 kilometer<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach 10 gig</font>

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,869
optics DWDM tuned optics anything that's

226
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,640
out of the ordinary that's out of short

227
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,310
reach stuff that you might you might

228
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,350
find anywhere it is very widely

229
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,290
supported and it's also very popular

230
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:10,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">among enterprises because sea explorer</font>

231
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:14,430
LF for support so then there's the x2

232
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:16,830
which is basically an evolution off of

233
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,839
xenpak electrically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connectors are</font>

234
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,640
exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anything you can say</font>

235
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,230
about xenpak you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> about x2 except</font>

236
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,290
it's smaller and draws a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little less</font>

237
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,610
power but it's the exact same thing the

238
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,069
exact same<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware implemented the</font>

239
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,780
exact same way but you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

240
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,420
higher density out of it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's physically smaller and it's not</font>

247

248
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,750
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've kind of seen lukewarm</font>

249
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,830
support for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a lot of operators</font>

250
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:58,850
so right now it is very limited and the

251
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,770
choices on exotic optics are almost none

252
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,860
you can it's been pointed out to me that

253
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:07,790
there are third parties that sell some

254
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,290
some you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40-kilometer DWDM tuned</font>

255
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,670
versions of this but if you bought a

256
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,800
cisco product you can't buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from</font>

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">cisco so by definition it's not</font>

258
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:21,630

xpack<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't even bother to look up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to the X to the only difference</font>

263
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,800

<font color="#CCCCCC">of talk in the industry about combining</font>

271

272
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,560
double redundant and that never happened

<font color="#CCCCCC">systems and because the five framer has</font>

285
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,140
been offloaded you can now make this

286
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,240
thing talk to to multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems so you</font>

287
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">can take the same optic and plug it into</font>

288
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,910
an OC 182 into a 10 gig into a tank

289
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,210
fibre channel and to transport here and

290
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,280
it'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and it's also right now</font>

291
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,740
one of the most commonly deployed optics

292
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,900
you could you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could debate as to whether</font>

293
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,670
it's more popular than xenpak or not but

294
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,060
it's certainly getting up there and it's

295
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:55,719
certainly rising faster than impact and

296
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,489
it has a full support of exotic optics

297
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,500
you can do you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do full 80 kilometer</font>

298
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,080
reach you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do full DWDM in fact it's</font>

299
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,110
even cheaper to do DVD em on this than

300
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,800
it is unzen pack the only limitations

301
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,290
are limited cx4 and no LX for technology

302
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,300
and i'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about that in a bit</font>

303
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,540
but it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

304
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,370
a huge power savings as well so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

305
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,510
really you can do high density on these

306
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,160
cards<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the brand new one that a</font>

307
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:29,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are just now starting to</font>

308
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,189
see with the announcement of the cisco

309
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,190
nexus platform and a couple other things

310
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:37,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are coming later this year is the</font>

311
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,590
sfp+ and basically this is an evolution

312
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,110
on

313
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,600
the original sfp it's physically the

314
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,880
same dimensions it's the same 20 pen

315
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,610
connector but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously it's very</font>

316
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,040
different internally and the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal</font>

317
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is to extend the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multi rate support</font>

318
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,680
all the way down to do a gig fibre

319
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,620
channel so in theory what the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

320
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,359
this is to be able to build a slot that

321
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,660
will take either a regular sfp and do

322
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,960
124 q fibre channel or take sfp+ and do

323
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">a 10 gig fibre channel and that's not</font>

324
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,770
required by the spec but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

325
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,620
that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so that's that's part</font>

326
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:19,870
of the the ball the draw and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also this</font>

327
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,160
is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller than xop it's</font>

328
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,890
about thirty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller which is</font>

329
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,520
not a huge amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> XEP was already pretty</font>

330
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:29,230
small but basically they've a offload

331
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,569
the CDR functionality on talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about</font>

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit but expect the target</font>

333
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,770
market to be fibre channel enterprises

334
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,990
and very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high density tanking so here's</font>

335
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,720
a quick summary of the characteristics

336
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,010
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> say max ports / blade you can</font>

337
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,660
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> go higher than this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but this</font>

338
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of what it was designed for when</font>

339
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:53,740
you take into account thermal properties

340
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:56,950
heat sinks when I you can you can stuff

341
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:00,400
these things in a little bit higher but

342
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,070
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general overview so now to</font>

343
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,450
digging a little deeper here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font>

344
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,640
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start by talking about some of the</font>

345
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,490
the 10 gige pluggable component

346
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,110
technology so when I say Phi that's

347
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,700
that's a physical layer component and

348
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,369
it's broken down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into three subsections</font>

349
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,930
the physical coding sublayer the medium

350
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:19,270
attachment sub layer and the physical

351
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:24,100
medium dependent cell layer which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

352
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,389
basically the the framing and coding and

353
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,699
then you get down all the way down to

354
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the PMD and you're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

355
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,630
type of laser am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i using to fire over</font>

356
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,659
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular type of fiber to go this</font>

357
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:37,240
particular distance sir des is a

358
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,520
serializer deserializer and it basically

359
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">just converts between multiple parallel</font>

360
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,290
signals in a single serial signal and

361
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,960
the CDR is the clock and data recovery

362
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,300
chip which is almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> an analog thing</font>

363
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,880
just think of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as retiming and signal</font>

364
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:57,950
conditioning

365
00:17:49,880 --> 00:18:00,860
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chip so the tanking Phi comes in</font>

366
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,480
two major or three major variants but to

367
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,780
two variants as far as serial and

368
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,680
parallel the first two variants are the

369
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,990
10g base r<font color="#CCCCCC"> and w which are the land and</font>

370
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,380
land five versions of a true 10 gig

371
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:20,030
signal and they also implemented a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phi</font>

372
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:23,060
that runs for by<font color="#E5E5E5"> low speed 2.5 gigs</font>

373
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,920
signals to to achieve the same thing and

374
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,929
there's a few advantages to doing this

375
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,850
you know if you're transmitting a lower

376
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,250
speed signal it's easier as far as the

377
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,050
electronics<font color="#E5E5E5"> are concerned to transmit</font>

378
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,620
and receive the signal cleanly requires

379
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:38,210
less work less less technology but you

380
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,739
also have to take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

381
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,750
multiplexing and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to add a</font>

382
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,020
ser des that's going to add potentially

383
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:48,890
in you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of optical small</font>

384
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:51,379
optical MUX there's there's basically

385
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,990
two implementations of this one for

386
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,140
optical as Alex for which is for

387
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:59,450
wavelengths of light roughly snot not

same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spacing as a cwm product</font>

390
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,879
and there's a little MUX built in so it

391
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,850
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmitted four different colors</font>

392
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">of light alpha fiber and it works great</font>

393
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,590
for sending for low-speed signals and on

394
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,090
copper the the variant of this right now

395
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:20,090
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> CX for which is a proprietary cable</font>

396
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:23,860
or infinitive and cable but it's for

397
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:26,179
parallel paths over copper same concept

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">strangely enough the way that the</font>

409
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,700
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a significant amount of</font>

410
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,039
overhead and the other major one is x-fi

411
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,440
and now SFI which is

412
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the same thing which is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">channel of around 10 gigs and for</font>

414
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:09,580
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you take a 10 gige signal</font>

415
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,460
it's got a much more efficient encoding

416
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:18,989
method so your overhead for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 10 gig</font>

417
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:21,549
is only a few percent so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10.3 125 and</font>

419
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:27,039
between these two it requires a

421
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">you add one of these increases the cost</font>

422
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:36,478
of your component and increases the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heat</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and the power and consumes board space</font>

424
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:43,269
so obviously the ultimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal is to</font>

425
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,519

you have an interface bus that uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:52,509
parallel lines connect the dots it's

429
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:54,460
real easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement when you have to</font>

430
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:56,649
go between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two that's when it starts</font>

431
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,349
becoming problematic so optimal

432
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:03,309
configuration is XA you I talking to

433
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:05,109
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10g base X or X if I</font>

434
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:07,749
talking to something that stingy base r

435
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:09,999
or w and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sub optimal configuration</font>

436
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:13,149
is obviously the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mismatched version of</font>

437
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:16,330
that so when you have for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> X a UI</font>

438
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:20,738
which is the older technology talking to

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:22,239
a 10g base are for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if</font>

00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:24,609
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a big xenpak there's plenty of</font>

442
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:30,939
much smaller xfp not so much so that's

443
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,529
why you tend to see very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little in</font>

444
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,690
the the space of going the opposite

445
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:39,369
direction but you see lots of Zen packs

446
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:40,570
that are 10g<font color="#E5E5E5"> base are as far as what's</font>

technology you know the original

implementation of it was was a way to to

450
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,009
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of the technology at the</font>

451
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:53,499
time and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for example 10g</font>

452
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,999
base<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alex for you could you could stick</font>

453
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:57,039
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on single mode and get 10 kilometers</font>

454
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:59,049
the same as lr or you can stick and on

455
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,759
fitty grade multimode and get 300

456
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:05,590
kilometers so it was a it has place but

457
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,659
what you're attending to see happen is

458
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,949
there's new technologies that are that

459
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:12,099
are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed to replace these</font>

460
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,159
things the the big one right now is 10g

461
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:16,158
base<font color="#CCCCCC"> lrm</font>

462
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:19,460
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> long reach multimode which lets</font>

463
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,749
you go further than SR SR is ok if

464
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,220
you're you're doing stuff in the same

465
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:24,679
rack or if you've got high grade

466
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,269
multimode fiber but most people that

467
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,639
have to run 10 gig over multi-mode fiber

468
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:32,809
don't have a high grade multimode fiber

469
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:35,299
they've got the old crappy stuff so lrm

470
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:40,190
is going to be a viable option<font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing</font>

471
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:42,649
data center cross connects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> SR can't</font>

472
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,989
handle right now and the replacement for

473
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:48,320
cx4 and coppers is going to be 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> g base</font>

474
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:50,509
t which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer reach and lets you use</font>

475
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,519
your existing cat5 cat6 infrastructure

476
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,169
so you can now run this potentially

477
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:57,379
through a wiring closet instead of just

478
00:22:54,169 --> 00:23:01,039
with with your weird custom cables uses

479
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:03,408
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old rj45 connector so you're</font>

480
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,330
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the 10g basic stuff kind of</font>

481
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:10,190
started fade away eventually so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

482
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,399
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking earlier about whether the</font>

483
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:15,409
phy the five framer was was on the

484
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:17,899
pluggable or not this is this is what I

485
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:19,970
mean basically there's there's a big

486
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:21,768
advantage if you take the framer the

487
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,080
physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> airframe ur all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pluggable</font>

488
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:26,539
itself and that lets you make the

489
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,549
pluggable protocol agnostic so you now

490
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:31,249
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same pluggable that you can use</font>

491
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:33,289
for 10 gig land or land fly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font>

492
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:35,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in OC 182 you can use in 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gig fibre</font>

493
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:37,129

494
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,399
transport networks that are doing

495
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:41,988
forward error correction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think juniper</font>

496
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,228
announced a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days ago that they are</font>

497
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:47,720
now doing forward error correction

00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:50,960
framing off of their 10 gig 10 gig pics

499
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,299
on t-series so that will let you for

500
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,099
example now potentially take what used

501
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,679
to be an 80 kilometer optic and and now

502
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:59,809
maybe get 120<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometres out of it just</font>

503
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,330
by a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of software coding so</font>

504
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:03,889
it's great technology and being flexible

505
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">and being able to implement that on the</font>

506
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:09,049
framer without you know having to

507
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:10,999
upgrade your your your optics or to be

508
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:16,039
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement different versions of</font>

509
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:18,249
effect is a good thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously it</font>

510
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:21,919
allows component reuse which is great

511
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:23,989
another big advantage of the protocol

512
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,030
agnostic versions is it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much</font>

513
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:29,710
better if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:34,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">tengu and I kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens if you</font>

515
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,800
do it on the if you do it on Anelka's

516
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,590
and pack or next to or something like

517
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,270
that because the framer is on the

518
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,209
pluggable you have to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy the</font>

519
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:45,520
special pluggable and typically the cost

520
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,410
tends to be significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher in the</font>

521
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,340
order three to four times the list price

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:53,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the lrs to get an LW and you're also</font>

523

531
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,750
neutral pluggable you can insert it into

any<font color="#CCCCCC"> host</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which supports way in five and</font>

533
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,550
now use any particular optic you want

and and the other version<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

someone's knock and saying my circuits

down they say what alarms are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you saying</font>

and you say my link is flapping really

might want a higher quality type of

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,760
you're you're cutting yourself short if

596
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,530

604
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,490
happening here so there's different

605
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:14,280
power classes like a class one might be

606
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:17,100
copper or sr and lr class two might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

609
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,060
see here is along with the the dropping

610
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,530
of power which is you're getting down

611
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:29,159
pretty significantly by the time you hit

612
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,930
xfp but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to SF u plus what</font>

613
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,480
you see is they haven't really reduced

614
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:36,660
the power of the class<font color="#E5E5E5"> one they just</font>

615
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,240
kind of chop the top off so sfp+ was

616
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,880
designed under the premise of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

617
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">density short reach but chop the top</font>

618
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,690
power class off and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

619
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough power to depower along rich optic</font>

620
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,710
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

621
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:53,449
here's a quick little comparison the

622
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,890
different types of loft optics available

623
00:28:53,450 --> 00:29:00,590
and this is mostly just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

624
00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:04,250
look at later so there's also the

625
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:08,000
software side of pluggable to talk about

626
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:10,670
so pluggable talk to the host via a low

627
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,049
speed control bus that's a lot of

628
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,420
commands like power up power down

629
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:17,030
there's diagnostic information loss of

630
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,890
signal whenever there's a the big one

631
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,149
which is the digital optical monitoring

632
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,320
which is is great when you're

633
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,600
troubleshooting<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer when issues</font>

634
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,120
because you can now see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the power</font>

635
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,559
is on a particular circuit that might be

636
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,760
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad without having to dispatch</font>

637
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,178
attack and train them how to work a

638
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:34,640
light meter but the other side effect of

639
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:37,910
this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things are now</font>

640
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,640
capable of reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> eeprom data and that</font>

641
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:43,700
includes things like optic type<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor</font>

642
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,429
name and vendor name becomes important

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will disclaim the next couple</font>

cisco is seventy percent of the 10 gig

because these<font color="#CCCCCC"> eeproms are programmable</font>

668
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:49,940
it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anyone to have a store</font>

669

that one knows in South Cisco and

672
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,560
there's also a significant market in

673
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,090
doing this and there's been some

674
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,080
analysis on the numbers and it's

675
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:04,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically come out that Cisco in fiscal</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's profit so there's a huge huge</font>

680

incentive for vendors to keep customers

681

locked into one<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular source of</font>

optics and not let them wander around or

00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:27,320
buy cheaper so how the vendors keep

684
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,880
customers locked in basically psychology

685
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,280
so you know you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the obvious</font>

if your uncertainty doubt which is if

712
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,730
these things from being resold outside

714
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,960
that way then what ends up happening is

715
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,240
they resort to vendor locking where they

716
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">just say if it's not our brand is able</font>

vendors are kind of waffling on the

this specifically and they said well

763
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,060
say there's certain features that only

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,520
our optics are going to do when the big

will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some intentional disabling and</font>

768
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,510
some vendors and new code of those

769
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:38,179
features so quick review at the end wrap

770
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,430
this up basically what format<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right</font>

771
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:42,049
for you so if you're considering<font color="#CCCCCC"> xenpak</font>

772
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:43,609
the advantages are there's a huge

773
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,250
established base you can buy them

774

anywhere it has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best selection of</font>

long reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> india medium and that's</font>

776
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,429
quickly being eclipsed if it hasn't

777
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:55,220
already been by exit p but it also has

<font color="#CCCCCC">you the disadvantages obviously it's</font>

784
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,980
it's very large draws a lot of power so

785
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,480
you're really not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever going to see more</font>

than than four ports on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a blade</font>

787
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,420
and it is not protocol agnostic so

788
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,689
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay more for land Phi</font>

789
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,730
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be less friendly to use</font>

790
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:27,070
and this is not the lowest cost solution

791
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,630
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it still has its place and we're</font>

fact it has lower power requirements and

798
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,700
it's very easy for people who are

799
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,200
manufacturing boards that use impact to

802
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,419
the board is really designed they just

803
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,670
move a few components around packing a

804
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:58,270
little higher density it's roughly more

00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same it has full support for LX for</font>

806
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:05,590

810
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,880
developed as X to the disadvantages

811
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:18,160
right now there's very little deployed

812
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,800
base there's very few sources to get it

813
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,649
from and there's very little and the

814
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,750
options of long reach exotic optics etc

815
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,700
and not that there's ever anything

816
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,440
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent that but it's</font>

817
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,240
just a matter of customer demand and

818
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,500
right now there isn't any and it

819
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,200
basically it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same other</font>

820
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,810
limitations as impacts so if you have to

821
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,210
pick that should say the best the worst

822
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,730
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> both worlds between does and yeah but</font>

823
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,890
yeah it's it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work the worst</font>

824
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:49,270
of all the disadvantages and none of the

825
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:51,759
real advantages so exit p big advantages

826
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,680
are there is a large deployed base

827
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,609
they're cheap and easy to find there's a

828
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,649
whole lot of people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these out</font>

829
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:02,230
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of technology coming out</font>

830
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:04,210
in the form of lr m and<font color="#E5E5E5"> n Tingy base t</font>

831
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:07,090
that are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> replace else for cx4</font>

832
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,000
so you might not need those those

833
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:12,160
impacts anymore the power and density

834
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,980
are actually very good you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

835
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,118
actual power difference between an<font color="#CCCCCC"> lr on</font>

836
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,650
an element X fpn sfp+ is minimal so if

837
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,359
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to design a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">high-density</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> xfp bored you could</font>

839
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:27,980
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do higher than 16 per slot</font>

840
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:32,239
but you have to draw a limit with

841
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:34,339
different power classes it's protocol

842
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,220
agnostic it's easy to spare better from

843
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:39,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ryan Phi and it actually is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cheapest</font>

845
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:44,149
disadvantages there's there's no Alex

floor for it and somebody actually came

847

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the cx4 for it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of</font>

848
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,739
it the connector is bigger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

849
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,629
pluggable itself so it's kind of ugly

850
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:56,119
and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> never be able to get 48 port</font>

851
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,269
played densities out of this so just you

852
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,670
know something to think about an sfp+

853
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:04,069
which is the new one to consider a big

854
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:07,130
advantage extremely high density you can

855
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:09,920
you can do 48 / blade just fine or 32 or

856
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:13,160
whatever physically it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as SP</font>

857
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,109
so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physical format where</font>

858
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,779
you could support<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old style and the</font>

859
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:19,759
new style on the same thing and you

860
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:23,539
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build an extremely low</font>

861
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:25,759
cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> 48 port 10 gig box and deployed</font>

862
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:30,079
everywhere the infamous Google switch

863
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:33,279
whatever the disadvantages there's a

864
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,420
hard cut off on the power budget so

865
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:37,579
theoretically physics there's nothing

866
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,349
that prevents you<font color="#E5E5E5"> from being more</font>

867
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:41,119
efficient but in terms of practical

868
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:43,880
deployment right now what you're going

869
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,230
to see is that you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco ships</font>

870
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,769
the Nexus it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even going to have</font>

871
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:50,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">support for lr you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SR you'll be</font>

872
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:52,729
waiting a while eventually lr will come

873
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,339
out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're never going to get 40 80</font>

874
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:58,730
kilometer you're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get long</font>

875
00:38:55,339 --> 00:39:00,680
reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> d2 b.m stuff out of these boxes so</font>

876
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,480
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're deploying these boxes and you</font>

877
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,730
ever expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get that kind of</font>

878
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,210
functionality you you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

879
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:10,809
problem so it's not inherently bad but

880
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:13,849
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full replacement for xfp and</font>

881
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:15,140
probably won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so here's some further</font>

882
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:17,720
reading if you want to read up on the

883
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:24,109
standards of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things URLs just read</font>

884
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:28,519
the slide and questions thank you I will

885
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:31,089
take one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions no Martin can</font>

886
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:31,089
you come and sit up

887
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:42,600
thank you very much Richard for a very

888
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:42,600
comprehensive presentation it
