for an hour or anything in between talk

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,490
about the results of the big ipv6 only

whole group of people but it's all being

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,210
led of course by Randy bush from iij

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:36,360
those arms<font color="#CCCCCC"> libert up with the with the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">old tomatoes you know some of us don't</font>

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,460
wait for things to break we break them

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:51,059
um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why Bugatti you probably made</font>

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,980
the finest cars in the world in the 30s

17
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,459
somebody once wounded him about the

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,620
brakes and he said it takes a genius to

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,300
make a car go any fool can make a car

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:09,750
stop so now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure the</font>

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:12,479
foolishness and we have one measurement

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,590
if you remember the raising of hands we

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,840
now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a metric of you know the extent</font>

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,100
of lying in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano oh god audience</font>

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,229
because when you actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,850
statistics not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many people made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

27
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:33,920
now some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people were only fibbing</font>

28
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,919
what happens was they moved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> EV do</font>

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,390
those wasn't outright lying i miss

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,899
phrase the questions people ready with

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:46,530
the pretty pictures this is uh that's

32
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:50,009
okay who's first well we've got bill

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">Fenner and we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Duane whistles and</font>

34
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,170
we've got Larry Blanc who took different

35
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,869
kinds of measurements and first of all

36
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,040
Larry's a bloody hero because he and

37
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Duane essentially made this all work to</font>

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:10,679
the extent that it did so they certainly

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,420
deserve a hand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill's mr.</font>

40
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,220
measurement over here came in late

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,760
unfortunate

42
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:25,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee and is having fun figuring out how</font>

47
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,140
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser that's what control</font>

emailing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've emails seconds before</font>

50
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:02,270
the deadline and we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

51
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,560
reliable email is so um us I have to

52
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,840
apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quality of the data</font>

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:10,160
because I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,880
prepared I grabbed packet headers for

55
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,700
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole time of the experiment</font>

56
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,980
and then didn't have any like plan on

57
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,630
how i was going to analyze them so this

58
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,750
morning I came in and said what should i

59
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:30,350
do well just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution</font>

60
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:32,209
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP arp and ipv6 unfortunately what I</font>

61
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,359
failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in this analysis was</font>

62
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:38,360
subtract out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT PTV for traffic</font>

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,019
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipv4 line so you see over here</font>

64
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,260
at like 12 25 but there's a peak in the

65
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:47,630
v6 and there's a perfectly matching peak

66
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,000
in the v4 so that's because the

67
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:57,709
traffic's be encountered is both the the

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">NAT PT the the v6 is probably mostly NAT</font>

69
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:08,140
PT and so the v4 there is the the v4

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,640
that that corresponds to that traffic

71
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,760
there are some interesting aspects to

72
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,640
this I mean certainly there's a huge the

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,529
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> y axis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is packaged per</font>

74
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:26,520
second arm and there's it

75
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:29,010
a huge traffic drop off I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,510
this is because most people couldn't get

77
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,130
things working or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who did get</font>

78
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,480
things working weren't doing much or

79
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,250
because the presentation was so

80
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,419
fascinating that everybody started

81
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,610
looking up instead of looking down one

82
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:45,780
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did find pretty interesting</font>

83
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,780
was that right when the experiments

84
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,780
started the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ARP traffic</font>

85
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,080
doubled you can't see it in the other

86
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">graph because it was such a small line</font>

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,870
compared to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones this is</font>

88
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,710
partly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dwayne was pinging all</font>

89
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:07,980
the ipv4 addresses on the subnet which

90
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,500
will show that graph in a minute but

91
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,770
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just that there were a whole</font>

92
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:20,960
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of arps for off net addresses you</font>

93
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:23,789
know is are paying for 24<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 7 8 so some</font>

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,010
implementations seem to be making this

95
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,419
off net a<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject or on that assumption</font>

96
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,909
that you know if you don't have a

97
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:35,159
default route just<font color="#E5E5E5"> art for it you know</font>

98
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">no harm can come and I now get easy Nana</font>

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:43,710
the Nana XP net ? oh it's they had a

100
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,930
beautiful address question they had no

101
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">beef or exit right yeah okay oh that's a</font>

102
00:05:48,930 --> 00:06:00,169
limitation in the data collection

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:06:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that'll fix for next time and then on</font>

104
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:06,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">another piece of data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we collected</font>

105
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:11,460
was the MAC addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> associated to a</font>

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:16,260
given SSID the two bottom ones the kind

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">of bluish and white ones were the the</font>

two v6 experiment<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSIDs the blue one was</font>

109
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,569
for was the normal one and then the

110
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,289
white one was

111
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:30,179
for XP and even before the experiment

112
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:32,818
they were people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of evenly</font>

113
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:35,188
distributed across them at the

114
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">experiment time the population of these</font>

115
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:39,899
societies went way up and on the

116
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:43,979
population<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the normal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSIDs went way</font>

117
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:46,020
down Larry pointed out that there's

118
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:52,679
probably a data collection error here

119
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:55,020
because the the red and the brown top

120
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:57,270
two lines are actually counting the same

121
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:02,099
thing so that here's another instance of

122
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:05,430
double counting because the nanog in the

123
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:11,878
nanog assi DS end up on the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

124
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:14,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">end network so you could kind of just</font>

125
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,990
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the top brown thing isn't</font>

126
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:20,550
there and that's probably representative

127
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:23,550
of reality but the the normal v4 stuff

128
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,619
did go way down during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour as</font>

129
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,089
expected because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs weren't even</font>

130
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:31,229
there to be associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in the first</font>

131
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:43,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">place all right um doing or did you have</font>

132
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:49,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">a graph touch pads and I don't get along</font>

133
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:51,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the wrong thing let's I am</font>

134
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:55,619
not qualified to operate this computer I

135
00:07:51,089 --> 00:08:00,869
better stuff your hole in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the center</font>

136
00:07:55,619 --> 00:08:02,879
tonight I'll leave it to you want to

137
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:06,930
maximize it I don't know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

138
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:10,050
maximize so that's what we did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

139
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,819
this is this is windows its brain

<font color="#CCCCCC">damaged you know youth rotate it again</font>

141
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,259
what you have is a whole bunch of em

142
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:20,869
uniques users trying to deal with

143
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:23,819
windows XP so as as bill said there's a

144
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:28,319
there's a box here which one things that

145
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:31,050
does is pings all of the ipv4 addresses

146
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,818
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard network and this graph</font>

147
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">just shows the results of that pinging</font>

148
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:37,110
over time I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a break</font>

149
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,250
right before the UV six hours so there

150
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,510
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little drop-off there but then</font>

151
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,120
right around twelve o'clock there's a

152
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,860
you know there's a steep drop-off and

153
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,670
what I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting about this data</font>

154
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,899
is that at one o'clock when when v4

155
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,719
comes back it kind of takes a while for

156
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,029
people to migrate back over to to this

157
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,410
teasing before so it seems like at least

158
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">some people were happy for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while to</font>

159
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:02,790
continue using ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> after after the v4</font>

160
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:07,559
came back in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vport pinging did you</font>

161
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:10,290
include the 19 18 space that was in how

162
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">did you get to any v4 addresses or no</font>

163
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,569
well the this this I don't affect the

164
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,980
corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> but these are you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diss</font>

165
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:18,959
servers that are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> the switches</font>

166
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,149
and our service dns servers those are

167
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,349
still connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the the wired right</font>

168
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:31,170
we just couldn't think the wireless yes

169
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:34,079
oh sorry yeah lunch

170
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:38,189
right so there goes that brilliant

171
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:40,888
theory of mine thank you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> it took</font>

172
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:45,709
to 1500 to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up again yeah but it was</font>

173
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:45,709
the same curve at nine kind of

174
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Larry brings his own quick enough to get</font>

175
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:15,279
it yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found new hardware thank</font>

176
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:15,279
you yes

177
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:33,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I was responsible for giving the</font>

178
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:36,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">NAT PT stuff to work hadn't originally</font>

179
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:38,349
planned on implementing it I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

180
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:40,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">one implementation a couple weeks ago</font>

181
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:43,989
and i briefly looked at it but hadn't

182
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:47,439
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan was to to</font>

183
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:51,849
use cisco to do NAT PT but we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

184
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:54,699
issues getting that to work so as a kind

185
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:56,169
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> last-minute thing to try to get</font>

186
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:59,049
something working i downloaded this

187
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:02,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">linux implementation and we have a</font>

188
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:06,459
laptop that's running a cacti stats

189
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:08,348
collector so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on there the</font>

190
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,049
problem was that only has one ethernet

191
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:13,749
interface sir and we have multiple

192
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:16,959
networks so we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on a trunk port</font>

193
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:18,909
on the switch and configured three

194
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:25,539
separate VLAN interfaces on the trunk

195
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:29,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">port on the laptop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were able</font>

196
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:31,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get that that Ronnie there are some</font>

197
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,709
issues with this implementation it

198
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:36,729
doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have gotten a lot of</font>

199
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:39,309
actual usage and testing its user space

200
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,989
space so it puts the interfaces in

201
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:43,598
promiscuous mode and basically just

202
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:46,929
listens to all the packets and and does

203
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:49,359
the translation and user space so i

204
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:53,559
won't go over at PT in too much detail

205
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:58,839
is just basically you take use<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns to</font>

206
00:11:53,559 --> 00:12:01,389
spoof v6 addresses you do a lookup for a

207
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,389
a record and if there's no qua day than

208
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:08,949
you synthesize a quad a and translated

209
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:11,289
it into v6 address space and and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat</font>

210
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:15,608
PT demon maintains the mapping from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

211
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:17,649
view for a dress to the v6 address so

212
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:21,489
there were some issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the demon</font>

213
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:23,319
appeared to be repeatedly hanging and we

214
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:25,599
started at numerous times to get it

215
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:28,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">working again although it did seem to</font>

216
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:30,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">work better during the v6 hour so I have</font>

217
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,519
a theory now that the problem was that

218
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:36,639
it was only configured to listen on the

219
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,970
v6 and XP v6 networks but there's also

220
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,959
v6 running on the main

221
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:44,810
nanog nanog a network and you can

222
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,420
potentially use that network to get to

223
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:50,209
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net PT box if you're pointing to the</font>

224
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:53,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">dns server that does a translation so i</font>

225
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:56,420
suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people were actually going</font>

226
00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:00,649
from the main nanog network to the nat

227
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,750
PT box and that was causing issues but

228
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:06,259
since we shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down that that made the</font>

229
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:09,620
nanog a and nanog networks during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6</font>

230
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:11,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">our that traffic wasn't going to the box</font>

231
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,399
at that time so it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

232
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:15,439
traffic from the networks that was

233
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,269
expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get traffic from and it was</font>

234
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:21,620
it seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be working better during</font>

235
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:23,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that time so i also have a couple Graf's</font>

236
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,509
from the cacti stats that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i generated</font>

237
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:30,378
and this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the total traffic</font>

238
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:33,470
through crg west and you can see up till

239
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:35,720
noon we're at about 20 megabits and then

240
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:40,339
right at noon it drops down to two or

241
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,410
three and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 20 I think is</font>

242
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:45,259
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT PG started working better</font>

243
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,949
and there was you can see the traffic

244
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:51,800
going up to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 megabits then and</font>

245
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:56,540
then there's a drop-off at 1pm for lunch

246
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:01,128
break and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the total number</font>

247
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:05,389
of associations on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> APS so we peaked</font>

248
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:10,550
it around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 314 early in the day and then</font>

249
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:13,100
at noon<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drop down down to</font>

250
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:17,089
around a hundred clients right at noon

251
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,370
and then we pulled the SS IDs out at

252
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:25,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so then they reassociate it</font>

253
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:26,720
and it went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to 175 or so which</font>

254
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:34,129
stayed pretty consistent throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

255
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:36,529
hour note that last shows that they

256
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:39,649
associated it later too not that they

257
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:42,939
got packets through it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> great but</font>

258
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:46,399
the previous graph if you don't mind

259
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:50,370
does show first of all the outbound just

260
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:54,620
remains you know within 50 70

261
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:59,550
aunt of what it had<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in just at</font>

262
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:02,310
previously and the inbound slowly

263
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:07,250
recovers as they find they can get to

264
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,250
the normal porn sites or whatever yeah

265
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,470
correct out there would be some

266
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,370
component of the streaming traffic that

267
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:28,110
was going on yea though that would have

268
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:30,990
dropped off<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1300 I don't know when we</font>

269
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,060
actually stream and don't Jason do we

270
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:44,240
did we start did we continue screaming

271
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:47,250
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1300</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yep pardon that's the egress</font>

272
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,490
that's the upstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp connection</font>

273
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,320
egress so everything goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sue is not</font>

274
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:56,450
reflected on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this graph so other</font>

for ITF right pet cetera the next

you a J Hanigan with impulse internet

285
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:32,069
and this may be a related to the
