00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,790
next up on deck is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul Francis with a</font>

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:17,070
configuration on the approach to

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,710
shrinking fibs thank you hi Sam I'm Paul

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,560
Francis from Cornell so I'm the thing

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,090
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today is it's</font>

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,130
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call virtual aggregation</font>

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,800
but basically it's a technique by which

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,900
a single individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP without</font>

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,390
coordinating with anybody else can

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,030
reduce the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their fib just</font>

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,340
through a series of configuration tricks

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,140
on their routers specifically it reduces

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,420
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIB size and the ribs on the</font>

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,239
routers but it doesn't reduce the rib

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,030
size on on route reflectors as you'll

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">see but you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea here is that</font>

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,750
any eyes peas that are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,219
up against having to upgrade their

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,489
routers because they're running out of

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,260
fib space rather than do that can do the

21
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,530
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration i'm going to show</font>

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,789
you and put off you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the time</font>

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,909
of which you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> broader</font>

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,830
is to you know however long or too when

25
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,450
you have to update them for upgrade them

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,679
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> other reasons and so on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um i'm</font>

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,090
going to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with just a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides</font>

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,770
first I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you the status of</font>

29
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,080
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work it's really a bit premature in</font>

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,199
fact the reason I'm giving this talk is

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,850
that you know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of details</font>

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,340
and in fact there's multiple ways you

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,429
can do this and although we've managed

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually configure one of them on a</font>

35
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,680
set of router specifically some routers

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,439
from the Wisconsin whale testbed it's a

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,390
very small small scale configuration and

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,699
it's just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I suspect are many</font>

39
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,290
ways to do this and by no means the best

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,820
way to do this so we have set this up on

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,320
a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale but we have a lot more</font>

42
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,740
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and really what I'm here for</font>

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,240
is to try to convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few of you who</font>

44
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,210
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in this and who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

45
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,908
understand router configuration to help

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,798
us out I mean my student you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know pores</font>

47
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,420
over the manuals and stuff to try to

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,619
figure out ways to do this it takes an

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,660
hours and hours and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's</font>

50
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,679
plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people in this room who could</font>

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,390
probably tell me in five

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,250
minutes the best way to go about this so

53
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,929
in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the limited experiments</font>

54
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,810
we've done on actual configurations

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,150
we've done some modeling based on data

56
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,250
from a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp I'll show you a little</font>

57
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of those results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but but that's</font>

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,400
that's where we're at so far there's a

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,159
lot more work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again I'm</font>

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,659
trying to solicit your help so as I say

61
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,489
here we have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested on a live</font>

62
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,170
network we've not tested with you know a

63
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,870
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dynamics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Radha's going up and</font>

64
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,760
down we've not tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale so</font>

65
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,169
there could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of of issues</font>

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,379
remaining that we have to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

67
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:49,019
and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interest of full</font>

68
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:52,470
disclosure Cornell does have some IPR on

69
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,269
the stuff i'm going to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

70
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,669
basically I've said this already i'm

71
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:59,040
looking for some router management gurus

72
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:00,810
among you who are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this to</font>

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,638
work with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so i'll be here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all day</font>

74
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,769
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be here all day tomorrow I</font>

75
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,060
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here on wednesday so what I'd</font>

76
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,680
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a small</font>

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,810
group of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> together who can come up</font>

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,450
with sort of a best practices kind of

79
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,949
thing and then maybe at the next nanog

80
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be able to present something a</font>

81
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:21,629
little more settled<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm just</font>

82
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,149
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to whip through the the ideas of</font>

83
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:26,459
this at a very high level not the

84
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in part because there's</font>

85
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">many details to be worked out and</font>

86
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's really three important aspects</font>

87
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:35,760
to it so I'm just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

88
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,439
them so what we're actually doing in

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,328
this like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said we're not shrinking the</font>

90
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,888
rib per se and we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> shrinking it on</font>

91
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,319
route reflectors we're just shrinking it

92
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,500
on routers and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing to do</font>

93
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,659
that is we're basically taking the DFC

94
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,579
table and we're partitioning it among

95
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,470
the routers that you already have so I

96
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,540
show here you know kind of high level

97
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,040
picture but it shows some pops and show

98
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,769
some routers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there pops and they're</font>

99
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,319
connected in some way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

100
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the following so again it's</font>

101
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,399
called virtual aggregation we take the

102
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,530
IP address space before v6 will work

103
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,199
equally with both weep are in

104
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,909
partition it into virtual prefixes so

105
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,819
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slosh sevens</font>

106
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,959
although it doesn't have to be sevens on

107
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,168
each I speak could pick their own

108
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,478
virtual prefixes but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

109
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,849
you you create these virtual prefixes

110
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:27,060
and then you assign each one two

111
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,910
routers and then you run that set of

112
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,930
routers is essentially a VPN for that

113
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,700
virtual prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so with the result</font>

114
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,040
that what every router nose instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

115
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,380
the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> dfz is it knows all the</font>

116
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,530
prefixes within its virtual prefixes so

117
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,030
the prefix is that it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know today</font>

118
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,510
but only<font color="#E5E5E5"> within its virtual prefixes and</font>

119
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,700
then it has routes you know / sevens or

120
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:56,940
whatever two routers that are covering

121
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:59,010
the other virtual prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so sort</font>

122
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,380
of taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last rather busy picture</font>

123
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,690
here and throwing away the the purple

124
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and red VPNs just focus on the the green</font>

125
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,230
VPN a packet from some site to say a

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,110
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's whose addresses in the</font>

127
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">green VPN or the green virtual prefix</font>

128
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,320
would would go like this so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

129
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,770
start the normal way the site would

130
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,330
default the packet up to its isp notice

131
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,250
by the way that the the green site

132
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,380
doesn't have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to a router</font>

133
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,890
that's that's doing virtual aggregation

134
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,630
on on the on the green address space it

135
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,630
can be attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any router anyway so</font>

136
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,630
the packet goes up to the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p</font>

137
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,280
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle reaches a router that</font>

138
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,530
router which is a purple router doesn't

139
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,669
have the the sub prefixes for that

140
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,380
virtual prefix but it routes the packet

141
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:50,480
to a green router that does just through

142
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,670
normal bgp aggregation that green router

143
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,300
having run you know routing within the

144
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:59,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the VPN tunnels it to the green router</font>

145
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,140
in the destination pop and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

146
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">there it actually goes tunneled layer</font>

147
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:10,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">two out the isp to the to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbor</font>

148
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:12,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you'll have already noticed that</font>

149
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,950
path length can increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a result of</font>

150
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,050
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and router load can increase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

151
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,570
result of that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

152
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,420
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in a bit the path length is</font>

153
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:24,000
not so bad if you have a router covering

154
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,440
every virtual prefix in every pop but if

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,450
you take one<font color="#E5E5E5"> away like in this picture</font>

156
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lower pop no longer has a green</font>

157
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:33,180
router then the path can be quite a bit

158
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,770
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right so that's that's</font>

159
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,490
really issue number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how we</font>

160
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,229
chopped up the dress

161
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">bass and we essentially we're creating a</font>

162
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,669
logical hierarchy that aggregates better

163
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,169
than the current physical hierarchy the

164
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,880
second issue is this one right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

165
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:51,310
most of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers or border routers</font>

166
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:53,500
I've claimed that an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP can can do this</font>

167
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,580
independent of the other ISPs so the

168
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,680
implication is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're actually</font>

169
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,599
exchanging full routing tables across

170
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,430
the border and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's true if each of</font>

171
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">these routers is only responsible for a</font>

172
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,050
small portion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the address space then</font>

173
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,669
it breaks if they have to peer with the

174
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,280
whole address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space to their to their</font>

175
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:11,258
neighbors so what we do is basically

176
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,289
exploit the fact that routers are both

177
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:16,630
layer 2 and layer 3 devices at some

178
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:19,060
level and we configure things like this

179
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we basically set up a route reflector</font>

180
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the route reflector has a layer 2 path</font>

181
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,870
to the neighbor routers and the full

182
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,030
routing table is run<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the route</font>

183
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:32,020
reflector then<font color="#E5E5E5"> route reflector does</font>

184
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:34,000
filtering<font color="#CCCCCC"> an aggregation and sends the</font>

185
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,669
prefixes for the right aggregates to the

186
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,270
appropriate routers pretty much as shown

187
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:42,130
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it's not multihop it's just</font>

188
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,409
routing it layer 2<font color="#E5E5E5"> although I suppose it</font>

189
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,900
could actually be<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop and then we</font>

190
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,930
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP next top aggregate to make</font>

191
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,419
the packets go to the right place so for

192
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,150
instance we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a neighbor router who</font>

193
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:58,810
in this case is advertising a prefix 5.6

194
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">/ 16 it goes to the route reflector with</font>

195
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,090
the next top of 2222 the route reflector

196
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,490
in this case sends it off to the red

197
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,340
router but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it maintains the next top is</font>

198
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:13,900
22 22 and so when the red router has to

199
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:15,940
send a packet that's exiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> 222222 it</font>

200
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,210
can actually ship that purely over layer

201
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 so it tunnels through the green router</font>

202
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:27,310
without the green router having to have

203
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:30,340
those actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> fib entries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's</font>

204
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,409
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 that's really how you deal with</font>

205
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,240
legacy with other routers at the border

206
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,458
and keep in mind actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that both of</font>

207
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,049
these IPS can be doing this they would

208
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,838
<font color="#CCCCCC">just be exchanging the full routing</font>

209
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:43,149
table with each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then the</font>

210
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,459
third<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is dealing</font>

211
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,110
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that that we're increasing</font>

212
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,500
latency and we're increasing router load

213
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,690
and basically what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here</font>

214
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,400
and this is really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ugliest part of</font>

215
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,760
the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I suppose is that we're</font>

216
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,230
exploiting the fact that there's

217
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,640
basically a power law in traffic

218
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,140
distribution ninety percent of your

219
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,689
traffic goes to ten percent of your

220
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,150
prefixes so what we're doing basically

221
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,010
is we take popular prefixes prefixes

222
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,630
that have a lot of traffic and we just

223
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,790
spread them to all routers natively so

224
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:16,980
that those packets take you know normal

225
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:19,650
shortest path routing as today and as a

226
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,450
result most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you traffic is native a</font>

227
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,920
small percentage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

228
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,890
following these virtual aggregation

229
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,099
paths but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't result in much</font>

230
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,330
load I have a few results but let me

231
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,160
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you this particular one so</font>

232
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,950
latency actually works out extremely

233
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,510
well and this stuff is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in a</font>

234
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,790
way pessimistic but if you look at this

235
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,280
lower graph basically what we're showing

236
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,650
is the increase that an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP would see in</font>

237
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,180
load if they deployed virtual

238
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:50,579
aggregation today and the fibs continue

239
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,239
to grow as their projected to grow so we

240
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:59,540
sort of see 2008 we have 250,000 entries

241
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:02,130
by 2012<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have 400,000 by 2016 we have</font>

242
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,099
700,000 and so on this shows the

243
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">increase in load that would happen as a</font>

244
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,960
result of ritual aggregation using

245
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,330
routers that have only 240,000 fib

246
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,480
entries today and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that it's</font>

247
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,550
completely negligible until about 15

248
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,930
years out and then it starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow so</font>

249
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,000
I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

250
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,189
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually deploy this shrink</font>

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">your fibs extend your router life for</font>

252
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,620
years really and pay very little penalty

253
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,400
in doing that so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

254
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:36,390
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me please let me know very quick</font>

255
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,600
questions nope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well then we have a</font>
