00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,340
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much one of the</font>

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,740
more interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,269
controversial but still interesting and

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,789
fascinating aspects of this conference

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,970
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we'll be having an ipv6 only our</font>

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,310
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce the notion and the</font>

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,820
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush will be coming up to</font>

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:32,668
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> some comments for any others I</font>

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:36,780
believe fewer talk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> lavalier thank you</font>

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,069
which is yours I don't know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dough to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there that looks like it</font>

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:46,079
okeydoke back a decade ago we abused one

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,510
of the three developers of ethernet

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,760
Robert<font color="#E5E5E5"> Metcalfe for telling us that the</font>

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,070
network which collapse and he ate his

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,870
article that he wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infoworld oops</font>

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess I gotta be near here to hit not</font>

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:06,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you so this is going to be</font>

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,949
we get to eat our own dog food<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

20
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:15,539
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose of the experiment is right</font>

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,909
now flip would you right now we should

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">be eating our own dog food before</font>

23
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,900
inflicting it on our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers before we</font>

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,509
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions about v6 deployment and</font>

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,110
before we advise our customers about v6

26
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,689
deployment we should know what it tastes

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,920
like what it takes to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> edible and</font>

28
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:42,359
so this week you're going to sample two

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:50,240
recipes we have come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with for cooking</font>

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,240
dog food to make it edible okay and it's

31
00:01:53,299 --> 00:02:02,490
unnecessary sorry the metaphorical week

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:04,920
and there will be probably one time and

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,310
I forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time slot on Tuesday where</font>

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,949
we're actually going to turn off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4</font>

35
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,569
network there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be two very good</font>

36
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,540
speakers during that time

37
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,700
so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need network at all</font>

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,230
and for those people who really need

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,179
network because you have operational

40
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,310
responsibilities there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,209
some breakout room where the v4 is so

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,040
we're you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

43
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:32,430
completely deny your drugs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but and</font>

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,750
the idea the purpose of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not</font>

45
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:41,370
abuse its to actually sort out what are

46
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:44,609
the problems in v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real v6 pragmatic</font>

47
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,310
deployment because many of us have to

48
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:49,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">face it and we're already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finding out</font>

49
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,949
things this morning about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

50
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:56,849
to configure a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac so the DNS resolves</font>

51
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:59,519
properly for ssh etc so the purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

52
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:04,260
is a educational for us all to learn

53
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,629
some stuff be document<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so things</font>

54
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed can get fixed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

55
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:12,780
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolling this same the</font>

56
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:15,810
well something similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> out next week at</font>

57
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,139
apricot<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick meeting in Taipei we're</font>

58
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do something similar at AE TF</font>

59
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:25,919
in Philadelphia and<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four weeks</font>

60
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:31,259
or whatever it is ripe etc so it's time

61
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:34,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learning about v6 and we could</font>

62
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:37,708
have put up a pure ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> network to try</font>

63
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,720
but you'd only be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to the one</font>

64
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,659
tenth of the percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the internet</font>

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,609
that's ipv6 so what you get to see is

66
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:47,489
the wonderful calm a dancing turtle

67
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,409
that's famous and so here it is now

68
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we don't have a pure ipv6</font>

69
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:54,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">network here so here's the dancing calm</font>

70
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">ages so you can see it it's a terribly</font>

71
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,209
cute meme but you know you probably

72
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,129
wanted more from the internet and your

73
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,400
customers probably want more from the

74
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:07,439
internet so what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do to</font>

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,009
get more from the internet to get to the

76
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:15,478
real internet at the same time so what

77
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:17,909
we have is a pure I<font color="#E5E5E5"> pvcs one of them we</font>

78
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,949
have four SS IDs up and I'll enumerate

79
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:23,940
them shortly but one of them is a pure

80
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,660
ipv6 network with<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT PT protocol</font>

81
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,660
translator at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> border</font>

82
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that it can get to the dual</font>

83
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,660
stack external internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font>

84
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:39,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the ipv6 world and you can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

85
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:42,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv4 world so you can see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> com a and</font>

86
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:49,599
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see Yahoo all the endangered</font>

87
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:55,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">species are visible okay this this</font>

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:59,320
should work for unix linux<font color="#CCCCCC"> matt vista</font>

89
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,900
those things where the v6 stack and how

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> integrated in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the applications are</font>

91
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,330
supposedly well done in fact we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

92
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,490
finding breakage on all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay or</font>

93
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,349
that you have to configure it this way

94
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,830
while standing on one foot your head

95
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,840
finger in your ear etc we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

96
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,990
document all those and what has to be

97
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,609
done what the road bumps are etc etc we

98
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:31,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">NAT PT is a protocol translator that on</font>

99
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:36,460
the inside has v6 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and on the</font>

100
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:40,570
outside is dual stack so the land is v6

101
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:44,080
only it goes to an at PT translator at

102
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:48,969
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and can talk to the dual stack</font>

103

both v4 and v6 internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco</font>

104
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,680
routers have this built-in kind of and

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,840
we're discovering some wonderful things

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,430
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

107
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,109
aren't really working the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

108
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,000
describing are not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

109
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,740
perfectly and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're going to be</font>

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,780
able to fix them by the break we're

111
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,169
learning a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was the purpose</font>

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:11,559
of the exercise<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the does stateful</font>

the PTP protocols do etc etc for those

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do embed IP addresses which is a</font>

ftp RTP etc there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be application</font>

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,419
those who don't know that PT is a

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:45,690
controversial subject within the I

123
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:47,250
TF the ITF just last summer said Matt PT

124
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,110
shouldn't really be done its historic

125
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,930
and at the same time they realized

126
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,970
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no choice so the mat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pt's being</font>

127
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,710
revived and fixed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> God knows what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they'll decide to call it to save face</font>

129
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:05,430
but next<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay windows XP has a very</font>

130
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting problem it can move payload</font>

131
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:17,340
over v6 when you enable it but it does

132
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:19,110
not do DNS over v6 transport so if it

133
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,090
could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that quad a record everything</font>

134
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,610
would work but it can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the dns</font>

135
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:27,359
server on a v6 network it can't get to

136
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,670
it this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a horrible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bug microsoft</font>

137
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,140
answer is by vista I've been trying

138
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,360
Vista for the last couple days because

139
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,860
my stupidity i left my power brick at

140
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,920
home so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to borrow joel's vista</font>

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,600
laptop this<font color="#E5E5E5"> too seems like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows XP</font>

142
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">with more gooey and less functionality</font>

143
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">phelia the truth so I ain't buying it I</font>

144
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,090
wish they would fix the bug so I'm

145
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:52,890
heading for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mac store today and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

146
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:56,190
not kidding so the land so you have to

147
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,409
have some v4 to get to the dns server so

148
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,020
we have a hack whereby one of the

149
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:05,580
networks is up one of the SS ids is up

150
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:09,990
specifically for XP victims and it has

151
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:12,740
nine RFC 1918 private space to carry DNS

152
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:21,750
traffic so you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the dns server</font>

153
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:25,290
but you can't exit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> dv4</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so um you</font>

154
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,870
so you can now get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a dns server you</font>

155
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:32,370
can get the quad a record and you can

156
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:35,400
exit<font color="#E5E5E5"> via v6 to get to the world through</font>

157
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:43,350
the nat PT so you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to both v4 and</font>

158
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:46,740
v6 worlds<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but there's no ipv4 exit ok</font>

159
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:51,330
the DNA there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS hack needed for</font>

160
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and the hacks called um taught d</font>

161
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,100
and what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

162
00:08:53,190 --> 00:09:00,000
if you were on a pure v6 network what do

163
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,250
you do when you get an a record you're

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,920
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be able to use it you need</font>

165
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:13,550
a quad a ok so the DNS servers a special

166
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:17,310
dns server that takes the a record and

167
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:21,719
embeds it within a hacked v6 prefix to

168
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:24,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">synthesize a quad a gnat PT knows that</font>

169
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:34,350
hacked prefix and strips it and makes

170
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:36,930
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gojo my oh is it on yeah just a</font>

171
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,840
quick note that the DNS hack is required

172
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,870
for I'm virtually all not dt

173
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,960
implementations so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a hacker can</font>

174
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:49,800
you wait a minute ok gotta I just chose

175
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:53,400
to introduce it at the right point<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

176
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PT knows the hack prefix and strips</font>

177
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:01,530
it back to the v4 so it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out the</font>

178
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:06,210
dual stack external<font color="#CCCCCC"> network next so our</font>

179
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:09,990
network looks like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for the</font>

180
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,030
pink is for the XPS and and it works for

181
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody but it's for the XPS but it's</font>

182
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:19,500
not a pure v6 transport because it has

183
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:23,970
local for global<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 there's no default</font>

184
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:27,780
route out for the v4 ok but it can get

185
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:30,150
to the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> d hack go out the v6 router</font>

186
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:35,459
and add the nat BTW to the dual stack

187
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:39,329
internet v6 as<font color="#E5E5E5"> joel noted also needs the</font>

188
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:42,180
hack<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what happens I'm sorry what</font>

189
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:45,920
happens if one of these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> who should</font>

190
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to run on a pure v6 we're to get</font>

191
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,079
we're to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up something what was it</font>

192
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,060
were to look up cnn.com get back in a

193
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,380
record they<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't do anything with it</font>

194
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:01,619
so they also need the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> D hack to be</font>

195
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,810
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the synthesized quad-a go</font>

196
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,200
out here have not PT turn it into the a

197
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:09,479
so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you understand</font>

198
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,460
Todd d have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to know all</font>

199
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:19,470
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tati hat I'm the beef on</font>

200
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:24,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the client I'm on a v6 only client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

201
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:28,350
I issue a query to my local<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS cache</font>

202
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:32,579
which is taught d hacked for instance

203
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:35,370
google com it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> up do ghal calm in</font>

204
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:38,490
the real world and it gets back in a

205
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,020
record it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person who requested</font>

206
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,680
this is not going to be able to deal

207
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:48,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">with an a record so I will synthesize a</font>

208
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,520
hacked the six quad a record give it

209
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to them they will hit in the quad a</font>

210
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,910
to the night BTW server which will strip

211
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:01,680
the hack off turn it into an a record

212
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:05,219
issue the query<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat PT back disgusting</font>

213
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,640
isn't it sorry this is the kind of stuff

214
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,570
that it probably takes to deploy v6 in

215
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:16,860
reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and what we're trying to do</font>

216
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:19,770
is find out what it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes ok so</font>

217
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,380
the plan is all the SS<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids are up now</font>

218
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,480
there's the classic nanog and then all

219
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">day which you may not have realized all</font>

221
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:33,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">stack v6n be four classic dual stack</font>

222
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:37,410
these two networks which were debugging

223
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,900
right now nan odd v6 is the pure v6

224
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:43,079
transport know before you cannot get a

225
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:49,199
me for address on it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT PT at the</font>

226
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:53,870
exit and v6 XP is the one with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 19 18</font>

227
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:56,790
space so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dns server</font>

228
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:01,860
tuesday for an hour or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so nanog and</font>

230
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:09,200
trying to going to try to measure who is

231
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:14,280
using what what succeeded what failed we

232
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,110
very much want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get your data on what</font>

233
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,990
you experience of the bugs you

234
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:24,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience and will report on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wednesday</font>
