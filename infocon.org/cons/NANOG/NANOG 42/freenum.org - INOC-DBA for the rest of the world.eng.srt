00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:07,550
all right next up we have a John Todd

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,980
with I not DBA for the rest of the world

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,920
hi actually the the project is freedom

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,719
org and what that's the subtitle is that

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,609
I knock DBA for those of you aren't

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,279
familiar with it we're kind of taking

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,070
some lessons learned from prior IP or

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,390
voice over IP interconnections between

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,150
asn holders and applying them to a much

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> places it's completely impossible</font>

72
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,159
also when you're looking at e.164

73
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,599
numbers you can't delegate them they

74
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,150
come in while it looks like

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">hierarchically hierarchical models</font>

80
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,829
different places so you have to have a

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,409
completely atomic distribution of your

82
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:12,639

<font color="#E5E5E5">different places especially when you're</font>

looking at non enterprise and then

86
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,370
lastly e.164 has some real problems with

87
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,599
ownership who owns your phone number

88
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,129
meaning if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use your</font>

00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,150
different layers of ownership which is

97
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,980
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> problematic and doesn't matter well</font>

98
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,250

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,190
slightly different method of creating a

changed it slightly so now the one two

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,909
you can look that up and display it in

154
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,820
whatever way they'd like so here's a

155

quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS detail as far as what happens</font>

156
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,870
when you dial one of these numbers so

157
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">one two three four to start 256 we use</font>

158
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,520
the standard enum based reverse lookup

159
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,860
protocol only on the user portion so we

160
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,330
reverse the user or the extension

161
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,730
portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put dots in between it and</font>

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,320
then we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I tad number which is</font>

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a zone and then add free no morgue</font>

167
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,610
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end when you do that type of a</font>

173
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,570
and no it uses most of the same

174
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,520
protocols in fact it uses exactly the

175
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,810
same protocols for all the lookups the

176
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,640
difference is that the zone that you're

177
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking things up in is actually</font>

178
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,340
delegated out and there's a new

179
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,409
numbering system

180
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,609
or allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be delegated to</font>

181
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,860
the individual company so they have

182
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,540
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our own it scales as far as</font>

183
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS will scale so so far I'd say</font>

184
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,010
that that that test is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

185
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,389
pretty well and doesn't solve spit or

186
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,099
spam over telephony<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet telephony</font>

187
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,080
and the answer is no it doesn't it's

188
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,300
simply a pointer system which allows you

189
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,219
to determine what PBX are what device is

190
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,050
going to receive a<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it doesn't</font>

191
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,250
describe whether that device is going to

192
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,580
accept the call or not and that's an

193
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,620
orthogonal issue to the pointer we have

194
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,300
currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 600 participants we've</font>

been running the tests for about two

196

got it so that you can dial these

even the dumbest most brain-dead sip

have gateways available if you don't
