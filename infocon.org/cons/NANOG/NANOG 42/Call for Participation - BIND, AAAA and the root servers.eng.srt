operators of F dot root servers net and

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:26,189
I'm here to briefly talk about the

recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition of quad a records into</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root I'm februari the fourth iono</font>

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,500
introduced for the first time quad a

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,850
records in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root servers net zone</font>

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,129
initially we started out with about half

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:47,570
of the root servers providing service

13
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:55,110
over ipv6 and they're listed here a f HJ

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">K&M across all the root servers the</font>

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,850
queries levels were basically about the

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,609
same about 80 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 queries per second</font>

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,869
I don't know how well it's showing up on

18
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the on the boards next to me but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

19
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,390
red is obviously ipv4 in the graph and

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:18,720
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> little green at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top sort of</font>

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,149
the same ways we're using ipv4 that is

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:33,329
that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our local nodes have our</font>

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,509
prevent black bowling currently we have

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,409
about 13 notes serving ipv4 and ipv6

30
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:53,009
that's about a third of our over forty

31
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,530
three nodes worldwide right now most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

32
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,189
the traffic is primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to Paris</font>

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Amsterdam and then our global nodes</font>

34
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:03,270
to those of you who may be familiar with

35
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,610
the way I ipv6 has been sort of

36
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,788
developed that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not too</font>

37
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,030
surprising but however we've gotten very

38
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,440
little traffic in Japan<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we think</font>

39
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,290
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more because</font>

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:22,650
of because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the culture appearing in</font>

41
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:25,709
Japan we have very few v6 beers we're
