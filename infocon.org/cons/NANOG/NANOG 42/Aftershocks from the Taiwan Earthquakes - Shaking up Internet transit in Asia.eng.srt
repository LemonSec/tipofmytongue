1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
anyway I came back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normal program</font>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,149
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to welcome our next speaker</font>

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,809
Martin Brown from Renesys who's going to

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:17,599
be talking about the follow-up to the

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,599
the Taiwan earthquake analysis

6
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,920
quick announcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michaelson on</font>

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:43,760
Trevor's lightning talk was accepted to

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:45,290
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if Michael Sinatra whose</font>

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,269
lightning talk was a sec sectored could

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:59,780
contact todd or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Valerie to get the slide</font>

11
00:00:50,269 --> 00:01:01,040
sorter that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciated so</font>

12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,019
greetings good afternoon my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,330
Martin Brown I'm a data engineer with

14
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:06,679
Renesys and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">the aftershocks of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Taiwan</font>

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,450
earthquakes we're going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font>

17
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,530
at the shape of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> after effects the</font>

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,270
immediate after effects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,689
earthquake first which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a reprise of a</font>

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,490
talk we've given at apricot in last year

21
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,408
and then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about the</font>

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">shift in transit patterns the</font>

23
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,579
essentially the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fallout immediately</font>

24
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:29,119
after the earthquakes and foremost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

25
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:31,579
2007 so in order to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

26
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,790
introduce some concepts of how to get

27
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,860
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sense from bgp data how big</font>

28
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,560
market segment is and how big<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,920
geography is so it'll also introduced a

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,780
concept sometimes if you're looking at a

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,750
particular relationship between two

32
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,180
providers sometimes just looking at the

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,860
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of prefixes carried by that</font>

34
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,860
provider isn't quite adequate so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,930
introduce these topics and and then I'll

36
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,560
take some<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions at the end so we'll</font>

37
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">get started the submarine cables that</font>

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,549
were caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> on december twenty sixth and</font>

39
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,739
27th of 2006 there were a total of nine

40
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,739
cables two of them were not cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia</font>

41
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:15,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">netcom CAC gone philippines and they</font>

42
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:18,170
were reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> repaired as of februari</font>

43
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:19,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">14th of 2007 so the interesting things</font>

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,369
just to take away for looking at the in

45
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,580
the slides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow is that we have</font>

46
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,189
an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> that occurs on the 26 and 27 of</font>

47
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">December and then we have a repair event</font>

48
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:35,299
the completion that occurs on februari

49
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:38,209
14th so who is Renesys what do we do

50
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,290
Renesys has 200 we're basically like

51
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,290
route views but

52
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,659
we do more with the data so we have 250

53
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,269
full table peering sessions with over a

54
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:51,899
hundred and seventy<font color="#E5E5E5"> a esas across the</font>

55
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet sometimes we pair with na s we</font>

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,799
have multiple peering sessions to get

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,709
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> geographic redundancy in in all we</font>

58
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,379
cover about where one hop away from or

59
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,260
directly adjacent to sixty-five percent

60
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:11,250
of transit edges so that gives us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

61
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:15,269
deal of visibility into global transit

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,040
and global transit patterns so in this

63
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,280
talk we're really only going to focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,069
the prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that geo locate to the set</font>

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,959
of 22 countries that were affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

66
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,899
this outage so we're really trying to

67
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">zoom in on what happened in the</font>

68
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,200
immediate aftermath of the earthquake in

69
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of transit and then what happened</font>

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,929
in the remainder<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 2007 so this stuff</font>

71
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,209
is is old hat for for all of us a

72
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,540
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> outage just when the large</font>

73
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of routers worldwide remove or</font>

74
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:49,608
withdraw<font color="#CCCCCC"> a prefix and unreachable is</font>

75
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:53,040
when a there is no covering prefix for

76
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:54,359
that network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on instability is</font>

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,638
something that we're particularly

78
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,310
interested in instability<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when we see</font>

79
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,109
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of activity both bgp</font>

80
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,750
advertisements and withdrawals this can

81
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,030
be route oscillation this can be any

82
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,139
number of things but typically indicates

83
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:12,090
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sometimes indicates a</font>

84
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:16,769
physical problem sometimes it's just

85
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,849
router msconfig so what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

86
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at I'm going to speed through</font>

87
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:21,719
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly the shape of the</font>

88
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediate aftermath of the earthquake</font>

89
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then we'll actually zoom in on the</font>

90
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,099
transit changes over time as a direct

91
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,219
result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the earthquake and then for</font>

92
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:34,380
the remainder of 2007 so the first thing

93
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,169
to note in the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> following four graphs</font>

94
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:41,820
is that we see a ramping up of outages

95
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:44,099
and spikes and instabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next</font>

96
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,009
slides take a look at the will point out

97
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:51,060
the big spike the big spike on<font color="#E5E5E5"> December</font>

98
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:54,060
27 we see a grouping of earthquakes on

99
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,280
on the 26th and then we see an

100
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,060
the 27th which really seems to have a

101
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,739
big effect the recovery pattern we're

102
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,470
seeing a typically noisy recovery

103
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,260
pattern and we want to emphasize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

104
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably because this is a large</font>

105
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of distinct physical events that</font>

106
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,790
mean a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of different events that</font>

107
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,060
are occurring logically so let's zoom<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

108
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,770
on the outages immediately after this is

109
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,910
in the immediate aftermath of the quake

110
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,710
so on the right-hand scale we have the

111
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,570
seismic magnitude the Richter stet

112
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">Richter scale the for the magnitude of</font>

113
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earthquakes the first earthquake</font>

114
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:38,039
occurring on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 26 magnitude of about</font>

115
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,780
seven and there was a grouping of what

116
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,700
four or five there four or five

117
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:47,400
earthquakes on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 26th so now we see a</font>

118
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,130
slow note that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that curve comes up</font>

119
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,039
fairly slowly it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a peek</font>

120
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,740
but that earthquake early very early on

121
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,229
the twenty-seventh UTC seems to have

122
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,940
made quite a big quite a big hit now I

123
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,500
was thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it do you all know</font>

124
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">the game Jenga where you've got all</font>

125
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,370
these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> these little sticks that</font>

126
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Poe and you know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep pulling</font>

127
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">out sticks and eventually while the</font>

128
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,890
whole thing falls over and I'm kind of

129
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,030
likening that mentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that's what's</font>

130
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,039
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're seeing</font>

131
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,679
you're going to see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same pattern</font>

132
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,120
when we look this is outages so what

133
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,850
what this graph is telling you<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

134
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,400
of the set of prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that geo locate</font>

135
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:26,250
to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2222</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asian countries what we're</font>

136
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,609
seeing is that about<font color="#E5E5E5"> third almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4000</font>

137
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,320
prefixes suffered an outage that we can

138
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,120
pretty much directly correlate with that

139
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:38,039
that earthquake that occurred on the

140
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">27th so now we can actually break them</font>

141
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,130
down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at which countries were</font>

142
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:46,830
most affected and China and Indonesia

143
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,210
and India were hit pretty hard by this

144
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,120
so I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

145
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,969
on this this and going to move on we'll

146
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at instabilities</font>

147
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,710
instabilities we see essentially the

148
00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:00,150
same basic shape of the pattern but

149
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,539
instability we see a little bit more

150
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,700
noisiness and then we can also break

151
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,860
that down by country so we can take that

152
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">and take a look at what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were the</font>

153
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,819
heavily hit countries and in fact China

154
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,740
India and Indonesia come up and pretty

155
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:20,490
strongly here to show up pretty strongly

156
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,620
here so now the one of the things we

157
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,139
also want to do is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we know</font>

158
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,599
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> outages and instabilities are a</font>

159
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,189
fact of running networks particularly

160
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,069
when we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> really large</font>

161
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:36,449
markets so we wanted to get a sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

162
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:39,360
how severely did the earthquakes affect

163
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,580
these markets so what we did was to try

164
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,789
to factor out a baseline state of

165
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,240
outages and instabilities in each

166
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:51,810
country and then compare that that

167
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,090
median to the peak and see who was hit

168
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,750
the worst<font color="#CCCCCC"> China and Hong Kong hit the</font>

169
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:02,609
worst these are this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a graphing of</font>

170
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:05,599
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ratio of median instability so in</font>

171
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,189
the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks prior to the earthquakes</font>

172
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,800
we're comparing the median instability

173
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,770
to the maximum instability so what this

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,979
tells us is that there's about 70 times

175
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:19,500
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 times more outages at peak in</font>

176
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:26,370
Hong Kong as a direct result of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

177
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:29,039
earthquake 55 times more in Taiwan Hong

178
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:33,120
Kong Taiwan India pretty badly hit in

179
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,729
terms of network outages in terms of

180
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,279
instability well see now China didn't do

181
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,890
so badly in terms of outages but China

182
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,549
was severely hit in terms of instability

183
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:48,300
China shows thirteen hundred times more

184
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:50,219
instability in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ten days after in the</font>

185
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,640
ten days of the earthquake<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that than</font>

186
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,079
the previous two weeks so India China

187
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,120
was pretty badly hit Hong Kong as well

188
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,920
so now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually the that's</font>

189
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,060
just a lead-in to kind of say this is

190
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,089
this is the shape of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earthquake</font>

191
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,369
event and now we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

192
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">what did it look like after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font>

193
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,750
event well how did transit patterns

194
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,310
change who went to new providers so in

195
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,760
order to do that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of take</font>

196
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,680
a look at transit relationships how can

197
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,779
we take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these transit</font>

198
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,079
relationships identify them into mark

199
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:27,990
segments and geographies and and then do

200
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:30,449
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of objective using objective</font>

201
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,620
criteria come to some kind of sense of

202
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:41,128
how big a provider is in a market so we

203
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:44,129
do this by scoring and then ranking so

204
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:45,930
the scoring mechanism is actually this

205
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:49,290
this slide identifies the scoring

206
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:52,019
mechanism I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through it i'm</font>

207
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:55,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start from prefixes this starts</font>

208
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the slide starts from a asses so we're</font>

209
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,829
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do locate all prefixes we're</font>

210
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use we use a couple of</font>

211
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:03,628
different sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> of geolocation data</font>

212
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,050
and we coalesce them and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

213
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:11,939
a location for a prefix we assign a

214
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:15,059
score to that prefix so and the larger a

215
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:18,149
larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> network a shorter prefix is going</font>

216
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:20,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a larger score we also discount</font>

217
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:23,069
for cider so any cider any pre cider

218
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,480
assignments we discount those because we

219
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:27,360
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be less</font>

220
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,160
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilized than a cider assignment or</font>

221
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,339
a more recent assignment so we account

222
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,870
for date of assignment and then also the

223
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:39,660
prefix length we assign this score now

224
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,029
we also know the transit pattern that is

225
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,069
announced that is that shows up in

226
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:47,639
the routing tables so what we do is we

227
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:49,439
aggregate we we actually ignore any more

228
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,709
specifics you may be announcing that

229
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:55,349
share the same transit pattern so for

230
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:57,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">example if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slash twenty and</font>

231
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,639
you have a / 24 and you're announcing

232
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:02,849
them and we see the same transit pattern

233
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:06,089
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to ignore the / 24</font>

234
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,829
and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the / 20 so we'll</font>

235
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,600
assign a score based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this last 20 so</font>

236
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:11,128
at this point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a prefix we've</font>

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,199
done the prefix calculations we've got a

238
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,629
prefix with geo-located it we have a

239
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:18,149
score for it and we know the transit

240
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:22,319
pattern now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look</font>

241
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:26,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">at all asdas relationships so we look at</font>

242
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:28,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">every single a s pair adjacency that</font>

243
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,639
shows up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,479
assign a relationship to that edge it's

245
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,120
a transit edge it's appearing edge

246
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,579
there are some more unusual

247
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,260
relationships such as transit swap<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS</font>

248
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:46,489
clustering as clustering is where one

249
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,470
organization uses more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than one a s but</font>

250
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,579
we're basically you know for purposes of

251
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,769
this discussion we're really interested

252
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:54,199
in those transit edges so now we've got

253
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:57,350
transit edges that are tagged and now we

254
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:59,569
can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look we can combine we know</font>

255
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:03,019
which edges<font color="#E5E5E5"> are transit edges and we</font>

256
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:06,500
know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a score for a prefix and</font>

257
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:09,320
which edges it shows up on so this is

258
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">this computationally intensive but it's</font>

259
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,560
quite simple to take a look at the

260
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,870
transit pattern and say well this is a

261
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,599
retail this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this fits into the retail</font>

262
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">market this fits into a wholesale market</font>

263
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,889
and this fits into a backbone market

264
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:24,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">just by looking at where a prefix shows</font>

265
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:28,430
that where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s relationship shows up</font>

266
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:32,870
on the prefixes transit pattern that

267
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:36,019
gives us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to calculate a score some</font>

268
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:40,430
a score to the geo-located region or to

269
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:42,800
a market so that's how we do rankings

270
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,930
rankings the score itself is not

271
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,310
intrinsically valuable what is valuable

272
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,399
is looking at the relationship between

273
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">those scores because we can get a sense</font>

274
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,720
for the relative size of a provider or

275
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:56,300
the relative size of a market the

276
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,339
relative size of a provider in a

277
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,180
geo-located market in a particular

278
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:05,360
market segment so the rankings give us

279
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:10,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they do not give us actual traffic</font>

280
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,069
volumes we can't see that from<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp data</font>

281
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,899
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see profitability we don't see</font>

282
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:17,000
network quality we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not see any</font>

283
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,610
customer satisfaction and in particular

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,170
we don't see we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see anything we</font>

285
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,130
can't divine anything about transit

286
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,529
location not intrinsically however we

287
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:30,500
can see there here are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we</font>

288
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:32,870
can see from rankings we can get the

289
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,810
sense for how big is a provider in that

290
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,180
market so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see by looking at this</font>

291
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,329
we can see who's a big retail provider

292
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:46,729
in Hong Kong who's a big wholesale

293
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:48,939
provider in Malaysia in China<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

294
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,580
also get a sense for weather

295
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,880
provider has a physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence in a</font>

296
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:58,800
region if you have a retail score if

297
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,820
you're showing up on that first edge

298
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,280
adjacent immediately adjacent to the

299
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:07,420
origin you're probably in physically in

300
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,880
that market the the case that we point

301
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,949
out here sprint carries an awful lot

302
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,550
it's the biggest backbone provider to

303
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:18,040
China but it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the lowest in</font>

304
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,890
retail market what can we can conclude

305
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,480
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well we can probably conclude</font>

306
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,060
that they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great physical</font>

307
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
presence<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're probably even we're</font>

308
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,300
guessing they're probably even

309
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,130
transiting the prefixes from someplace

310
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">else so the most important thing that we</font>

311
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,720
can learn from this is that we can learn

312
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:44,800
whether a particular provider is gaining

313
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:46,390
or losing market share these are the

314
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,790
countries that are most effect that

315
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,830
we're most affected in the earthquakes

316
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,420
the ones that are colored in and we're

317
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take a look at some we're going</font>

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,839

319
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we do the scoring I'm going to</font>

320
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at where each where we break</font>

321
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,300
down in terms of country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then where</font>

322
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,370
we break down in terms of provider so we

323
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,930
can then take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what in a</font>

324
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,210
particular market what are the per

325
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,030
country growth rates we can look at the

326
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the total market growth rate we can also</font>

327
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at how the different markets</font>

328
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,000
compare in size how the different

329
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,520
countries compared in size and in

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,770
particular the point of the talk who is

331
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:29,079
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has gained and who has lost transit</font>

332
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:31,180
and why so here here we have so now the

333
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,130
score remember that the absolute score

334
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,390
is not intrinsically valuable but the

335
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:39,610
relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so the relationship of</font>

336
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,990
absolute score the percentage so tight

337
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,110
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case take a look at taiwan</font>

338
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,300
taiwan is twenty-two percent as big in

339
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,810
terms of this market size calculation

340
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:53,530

<font color="#E5E5E5">china that's what this is telling us so</font>

342
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:59,829
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the year to year ranked change</font>

343
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,259
shows how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it has gone up in</font>

00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:08,769
or down and the year-on-year growth is

346
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,959
compared how much larger is that market

347
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:13,329
by this calculation how much larger is

348
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,540
this market today than it was a year ago

349
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:19,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the big the biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> growing markets</font>

350

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> India and Vietnam Vietnam more than</font>

at the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakdown of who's serving</font>

356
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:41,829
them so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this shows in red you'll</font>

357
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,869
see the providers that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

358
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:46,839
zoom in on in the next graphs to

00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:49,600
actually show how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many prefixes were</font>

360
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,879

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the key point</font>

362
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:57,100
here by doing this complicated scoring

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,529
mechanism we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually identify which</font>

364
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,869
edges are interesting to look at and

365
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,489
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can then zoom in and</font>

366
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:05,649
take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at how many prefixes were</font>

367

00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:10,869
can see growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes that metric</font>

369
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,359
isn't quite sufficient but most times it

370
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:14,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">is so we'll zoom zoom in on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

371
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,619
these in the next slides in particular I

372
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:19,659
want to point out the the big the big

373
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:22,569
jumps out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of nowhere Cable and Wireless</font>

374
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:24,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">tisca Lee telecom italia actually jumped</font>

375
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,490
15 places as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's it there's</font>

376
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,049
an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> story there so first this</font>

377
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">is clearly correlated with the</font>

378
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:34,059
earthquakes this is fairly unambiguous

379
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,240
the earthquakes occurred right around 20

380
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:39,220
26 of<font color="#E5E5E5"> December and we see that the</font>

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the time of the repairs</font>

384

bang they're visible back through sprint

385
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:54,340
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pretty clear correlation</font>

386
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:57,459
that of the immediate after<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects and</font>

387
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,080
and how China Telecom dealt with the

388
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,529
situation they got transit from Chung

389
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,860
hua I believe Chung hua was having some

390
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:07,960
congestion issues as a result of being a

391
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,158
transit provider to a lot of a lot of

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,320
they clearly got something now we we

434
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,030
took a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time to kind of</font>

435
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,870
narrow down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at see who</font>

436
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:22,050
they got well they got telecom italia

437
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:24,239
picked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> singtel okay but why do we not</font>

438
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:27,510
see such a sharp increase in the number

439
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,420
of prefixes carried on on this link over

440
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:35,040
time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this edge</font>

441
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:37,440
well that's where this the simple metric

442
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,300
of prefixes over time often<font color="#CCCCCC"> tells the</font>

443
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,100
whole story but sometimes it doesn't

444
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,780
tell the whole story so we need to

445
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:47,520
actually talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a different way to</font>

446
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">measure to measure from the set of peers</font>

447
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,300
that can see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet how many</font>

448
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,629

449
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,570
another so we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a metric called</font>

450
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:59,850
prefix peer time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to describe</font>

451
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:04,310
it this way imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a customer</font>

452
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:09,810
and I have provider a and provider be I

453
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:12,510
advertise my prefixes to both<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay some</font>

454
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:17,070
people will some places on the internet

455
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:20,370
will select the the a a edge some will

456
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:24,030
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> the B edge what the ppt measure</font>

457
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:28,830
allows us to do is to quantify how much

458
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:32,190
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is actually seeing using</font>

459
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:34,860
the a link and how much is using the be

460
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,360
linked so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just this is not from</font>

461
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,379
traffic information this is strictly

462
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:43,080
from a diverse set of peers so what we

463
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,540
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do assume 100 peers we've got 100</font>

464
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,699
peers and for one day we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that 99</font>

465
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:51,870
peers are choosing to send their traffic

466
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,670
inbound on link a edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one is</font>

467
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,739
selecting edge be well we can get a

468
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,920
pretty pretty clear correlation there

469
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,450
and guess that that edge a is pretty

470
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,500
important and has picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up some traffic</font>

471
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:06,870
so that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can then redraw this</font>

472
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,500
graph now note the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

473
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,179
this is prefixes over time so there

474
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,010
there is some fluctuation you see the

475
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:17,250
very clearly the quake induced stuff

476
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:20,100
early on and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of disappears</font>

477
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:24,330
here so the pier prefix time metrik

478
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:26,820
gives us a good a good sense for picking

479
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:29,550
up transit relative to how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

480
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,120
different peers see that inbound path

481
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:35,610
selected what this tells us is that in

482

the aftermath of the quakes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font>

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:56,860
they didn't grow relative<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the other</font>

519
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,700
Mediterranean recently so local events

520
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,730
can still have a broad effect and we

521
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,870
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more capacity both east and west</font>

I'll take any questions

hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ken Emery from cnet networks were</font>

you able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect any partitioning</font>

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,780
we're like from Japan you could get to

China<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not from the United States</font>

partitioning mm-hmm it's quite true I

532
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,939
mean that's when you have a diverse set

533
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,860
of peers you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of thing</font>

you Paul Ferguson could you draw even

the fly the press hubbub about the

<font color="#CCCCCC">magnitude more than the press hubbub</font>

about Taiwan but the Taiwan

instabilities and outages

573
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,540
were two orders of<font color="#CCCCCC"> magnitude more severe</font>
