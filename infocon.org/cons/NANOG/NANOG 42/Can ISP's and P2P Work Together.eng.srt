00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,950
yeah greetings we're going to get

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,100
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the after with the pre</font>

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,580
lunch session the first talk that we

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,980
have coming up is entitled can ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,019
p2p work together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a layered</font>

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:35,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">Popkin from panda networks and Doug</font>

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:46,078
these monies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi so p for p is a</font>

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,399
working group with ISPs and p2p

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,469
companies at trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work together</font>

11
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,640
under the DCI a the DCI a is the

12
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,129
distributed computing industry

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:02,160
association which is the p2p trade group

14
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:05,759
also with media companies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,380
service providers now participating Doug

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,039
here to let you know what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been up</font>

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to in the DCI a and it's sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,240
of this you know solicit sort of more

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,520
participation from the audience here and

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:23,089
folks representing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP community in the</font>

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:26,880
room so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're seeing the PDP market</font>

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,619
maturing and we'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of how the market is maturing and then</font>

25
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,430
about the p4p working group so digital

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,329
content delivery is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

27
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,500
heading and p2p in particular content

28
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are very excited about as a</font>

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,369
disruptive market opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver</font>

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,079
a very high quality content<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their</font>

31
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,460
customers and we're already seeing a lot

32
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,689
of examples of this i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know</font>

33
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,789
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you were tracking what the</font>

34
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,408
BBC did over the UK and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got NBC</font>

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,149
direct is rolling out some you know

36
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,219
production quality peer-to-peer traffic

37
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,140
so the sort of everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows the</font>

38
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,640
history in the nefarious illegal world

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,240
but it's rapidly we're seeing huge

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,439
changes as the production folks are

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,179
getting involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in seeing this as a</font>

42
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,559
viable platform for distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">media especially the high-def media</font>

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,569
which gets pretty expensive to deliver

45
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:15,640
online so the PDP market has been Mitch

46
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:18,548
from kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rogue technology with</font>

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,048
standalone applications to p2p being an

48
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:23,139
extension of the content delivery

49
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:26,109
infrastructure in partnerships with<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs</font>

50
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:27,670
and ISPs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the major content</font>

51
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:30,129
companies and CDN players are now

52
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,138
working with PDP companies so really the

53
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:36,849
perception in those worlds<font color="#CCCCCC"> has evolved</font>

54
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:38,709
over the last year or two so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

55
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,780
slide I'm sure you've all probably seen

56
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,400
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache logic it's a little bit dated</font>

57
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,049
actually think some of the percentages

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,689
have shifted back a little bit in favor

59
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,819
of web with the explosion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube but</font>

60
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,930
that is in no way really diminish the

61
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,879
explosive growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> of peer-to-peer</font>

62
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,139
especially with again the media

63
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,578
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting involved with high def</font>

64
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:59,650
video doesn't take much<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-def video</font>

65
00:02:54,579 --> 00:03:02,799
to skew that back into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> direction so</font>

66
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,109
there's been an ongoing wrestling match

67
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,299
between the ISPs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PDP companies</font>

68
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,340
where the ISPs can respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pdb</font>

69
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,760
traffic by upgrading infrastructure

70
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,219
caching terminating user connectivity

71
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">rate limiting various other tactics and</font>

72
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:19,299
the PDP companies can respond with

73
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:21,489
encryption and port hopping and a whole

74
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,129
variety of countermeasures leading to

75
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back and forth which really is</font>

76
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of a waste of effort on on both</font>

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,099
sides I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> so really a lose-lose</font>

78
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,479
yeah and pretty expensive for the ISPs

79
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:36,310
I'm sure you all know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive is</font>

80
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:37,870
to implement some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these measures so</font>

81
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,310
so fundamentally I mean obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

82
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,919
seeing this huge growth of peer-to-peer

83
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,150
traffic on our infrastructures and the

84
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,129
things we used to do to manage traffic

85
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,840
don't really apply quite as well to the

86
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,250
peer-to-peer world things don't flow in

87
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,540
the way they generally used to the

88
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,419
client-server model sort of thrown<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

89
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,798
the window<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just not effective</font>

90
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,049
to try and manage peer-to-peer in that

91
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,969
way it's very dynamic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> moves all over</font>

92
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,549
the place so what we're working on the

93
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,569
dcaa is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the p4p working</font>

94
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:03,729
group but we're looking for other

95
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,888
mechanisms that we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the pier</font>

96
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,449
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp community can still work</font>

97
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">together with the peer-to-peer community</font>

98
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:12,009
and implement some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

99
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,870
control mechanisms that we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

100
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:15,399
in the traditional model into the

101
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,259
peer-to-peer space and one of the key

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,728
pivots there is you know making the

103
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,719
tracker infrastructure smarter and we'll

104
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to how we're doing that</font>

105
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,190
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's p4p so</font>

106
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe it or not partnership and peer</font>

107
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,629
to peer companies in the scene anything

108
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,690
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the p4p working</font>

109
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:39,030
group is co-chaired by myself at<font color="#E5E5E5"> panda</font>

110
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">dogged verizon it's based on research</font>

111
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,419
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> yale and it's hosted by the</font>

112
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,210
distributing computing industry

113
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:49,530
association these<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies are in the</font>

114
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,599
core working group and then we also have

115
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">a number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> companies that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are observers</font>

116
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:58,199
and so the point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these slides is to</font>

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,539
show there's broad participation by the

118
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:05,940
PDP companies and network related

119
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:08,520
companies yeah so the goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> design</font>

120
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,460
a framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow the ISPs in the PDP</font>

121
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,469
to coordinate to guide the connections

122
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,479
in order to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> the throughput for</font>

123
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:20,190
p2p users and manage link utilization

124
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,258
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean one of the easiest things</font>

125
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,509
here is that the peer-to-peer guys even

126
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,099
when they're trying they don't have

127
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,240
access to our topology information they

128
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,710
don't know how our networks are laid out

129
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,870
how things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interconnected they can</font>

130
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,430
make some sort of guesses and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

131
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,719
if you can you know accomplish those

132
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,370
guesses and they're fairly accurate

133
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:36,930
you'd also don't know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

134
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,279
between business policies you know

135
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,930
there's peering relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

136
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,250
transit relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> fibra that's</font>

137
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,080
inexpensive Barbra that's more expensive

138
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,060
to expand capacity on so we're kind of

139
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,460
see if we can blend some of the business

140
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,500
requirements in with the technology so

141
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">we get a beneficial result the short</font>

142
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,699
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is reduction in average</font>

143
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,448
hop count is the huge win and we'll have

144
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">some metrics will show you on that one</font>

145
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:01,259
so in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

146
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,060
cooperative effort we're trying to look

147
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a solution that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an industry</font>

solution versus you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know something ends</font>

149
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,169
up being a regulatory solution and quite

150
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:11,610
honestly with the you know hints of huge

151
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,198
amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> high def traffic coming out</font>

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the peer-to-peer space you know let's</font>

153
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,389
try and solve some of these problems

154
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:17,460
before if the cope with<font color="#CCCCCC"> these problems</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not necessarily the position we</font>

156
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,909
all want to be in and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the flip</font>

157
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,740
side if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of drive the</font>

158
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:23,909
evolution as the you know I speak

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,710
community working with the peer-to-peer

160
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:27,870
community to get you know carrier-grade

161
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,370
solutions that sort of blows the doors

162
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,199
wide<font color="#E5E5E5"> open on things that we might use</font>

163
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the technology for ourselves for our own</font>

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,019
services and I like to say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

165
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,759
if the fastest<font color="#E5E5E5"> path from A to B is p 2 p</font>

166
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:42,769
and so from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the p2p application</font>

167
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:45,869
perspective a big win is a smarter

168
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:51,149
network utilization gives much better

169
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:53,610
performance for our users and as a more

170
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:55,829
indirect benefit is that by being more

171
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,899
efficient we have less impact on the

172
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:00,569
ISPs infrastructures which gives them

173
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,879
less incentive to manage the PDP traffic

174
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:08,999
which we think long term is potentially

175
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:11,489
a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge in the p2p business so</font>

176
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:13,860
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a picture at kind of a</font>

177
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:16,469
high level of the data flow of a

178
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,449
traditional CDN data is delivered from

179
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:20,308
the sea DNS infrastructure down through

180
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,099
the ISPs infrastructure down to the

181
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:24,749
users there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data transiting in</font>

182
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:30,360
large volumes but it's a predictable

183
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:32,669
data flow there's p2p which is kind of

184
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,929
random connections from random locations

185
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,279
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from outside the</font>

186
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,899
infrastructure some within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

187
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,819
infrastructure but because it's unguided

188
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,589
it's kind of random in all directions

189
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,059
which makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hard to manage and not</font>

190
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:46,559
particularly efficient from an ISP

191
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:49,529
perspective p2p with p4p knowledge of

192
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:51,839
the ISPs infrastructure can be guided so

193
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,999
that you can form connections on local

194
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,939
loops for example that don't consume any

195
00:07:53,999 --> 00:08:00,029
resources up from there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so on at the</font>

196
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,610
regional and transit level so it can

197
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:04,169
vastly reduce the data delivered from

198
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,229
the general internet down to the users

199
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,969
and also make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more manageable flow</font>

200
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:10,919
for the ISPs yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

201
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,139
is you know traditional looking you know

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,489
network management solutions but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

203
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,259
these in the peer-to-peer space you have

204
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:18,299
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of step out of the network up</font>

205
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,919
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application layer and work up</font>

206
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:21,029
there before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the choice is made of which</font>

207
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,769
pier to talk to because after the

208
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,479
choices made all we can do is you know

209
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,249
manage the traffic getting from point A

210
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,628
to point B as fast as possible this is

211
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:30,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay let's take our network management</font>

212
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,649
principles and change be helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

213
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:37,829
better choice for which be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

214
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:39,688
you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same savings we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

215
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:41,909
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked a little bit about</font>

216
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:44,039
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of this but more specifically here</font>

217
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,290
what we're talking about is sort of a

218
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,730
sharing of topology data in an abstract

219
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,410
way this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we're</font>

220
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,050
saying oh lets you know just give you

221
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,550
all of our router

222
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,439
configs and you know capacity planning

223
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,089
layouts and such this is let's let's

224
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,070
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is useful but</font>

225
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:59,019
it's essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sanitized generalized</font>

226
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that information so it's not purely like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I have four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> circuits over here and three</font>

228
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,449
routers over there it's sort of

229
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,860
summarized up a big part of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

230
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,209
privacy protection you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

231
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,740
we're talking about here from the isp

232
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:09,699
community I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think any of us are</font>

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,860
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

234
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,570
reveals too much about our customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

235
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,550
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> users and kind of you know calls</font>

236
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,959
them out or worse you know put too much

237
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,160
data out there that somehow we've

238
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,630
created a security threat for ourselves

239
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,880
someone else gets the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't</font>

240
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to have the data so yeah and from</font>

241
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,269
the p2p perspective some of the

242
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,010
challenges are that hat needs to be

243
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">highly scalable because the p2p networks</font>

244
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:33,130
are very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> and diverse and flexible</font>

245
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,200
whatever the approach is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

246
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,610
resolved needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible enough to</font>

247
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,050
apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a wide range of p2p</font>

248
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,370
architectures because there are many

249
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,709
different kinds of peer-to-peer networks

250
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,850
with many different characteristics such

251
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,859
as whether they're coordinated by

252
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,089
trackers or their tracker lives and it

253
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,790
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be relatively easy to implement</font>

254
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:51,040
because everybody here and all the PDP

255
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:54,040
companies have lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to do in</font>

256
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,110
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it needs to be a very pragmatic</font>

257
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,610
easy to implement and approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

obviously you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again we're coming to</font>

263
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,939
low-hanging fruit I mean this is ISPs

264
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,529
choose to share some information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

haven't shared before which pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

266
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,820
cost us zero dollars and you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know capacity savings will</font>

269
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,720
what we're talking about the benefits

270
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:22,510
being so high level picture of the p4p

271
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,570
architecture the peer-to-peer clients

272
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,069
talk to what's called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> p tracker or</font>

273
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,050
you know say the tracker and a bit

274
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,720
torrents warm for example to figure out

275
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,640
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to the bittorrent tracker</font>

276
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,060
talks to what we're calling the eye

277
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,890
tracker which is the ISPs information in

278
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,349
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide guidance back about</font>

279
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,660
which peers to connect to which so that

280
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,370
then the peers get told to connect to

281
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:51,250
nearby peers so fairly fairly simple

282
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:56,040
integration point and we've implemented

283
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,040
in integration it took days not months

284
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,739
so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the math of it it's a</font>

285
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,600
joint optimization problem where you're

286
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,010
trying to simultaneously minimize the

287
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,860
network utilization by the p2p

288
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,110
particularly the backbone link level

289
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,720
utilization and you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

290
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,630
maximize throughput for download

291
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,170
delivery so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ends up driving</font>

292
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,270
the the math of the situation in general

293
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,099
again at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this you know you're</font>

294
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customer gets a better experience</font>

295
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,490
versus having something slowed down or

296
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,800
taken away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

297
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,360
using so it's sort of we get savings but

298
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets to be happier at</font>

299
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same time so that's that's a win-win</font>

300
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:38,000
on both sides so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that in the</font>

301
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,520
first pass at this we're exchanging is

302
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,410
that the ISPs give<font color="#CCCCCC"> network maps into an</font>

303
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,839
eye tracker and the eye tracker provides

304
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,990
some abstracted called a weight matrix

305
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,000
or cost matrix of connections between

306
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:54,050
locations that does not give out

307
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,910
topology information so for example if

308
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,660
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hypothetical map</font>

309
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,969
of an ISP where pop<font color="#CCCCCC"> 123456 are</font>

310
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,500
interconnected with connections with

311
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,120
those you know those percentages are

312
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,040
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an abstract measure of how much</font>

313
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,959
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic to go along those paths</font>

314
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,779
and that gets processed into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matrix</font>

315
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,369
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says if you're in pop 1 then X</font>

316
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,980
percent of the time you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font>

317
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,330
to users in these other pops because

318
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,610
they're more or less connected and

319
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,830
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the abstracted guidance that</font>

320
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,350
peer-to-peer network gets in order to

321
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,150
say for example that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody's in</font>

322
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,190
pop one they<font color="#E5E5E5"> should connect to people</font>

323
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,959
and pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> two before they connect to</font>

324
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:37,850
people in pop four or five because

325
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:40,279
they're far away so we ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

326
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,709
simulations modeling the BitTorrent

protocol and using network topology

328
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:48,770
provided by Verizon and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Telefonica and</font>

329
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,089
the results so far yeah this is where it

330
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,520
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

331
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,380
emphasize zero dollars for I speed to

332
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,300
sort of contribute to this and if you

333
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telefónica and and Verizon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

334
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,260
before and after you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again</font>

335
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,180
yell modeling results but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yale</font>

336
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,579
research guys provides these nice charge

337
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,319
that show a huge reduction in the

338
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:07,609
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop count which we all know</font>

339
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">every time we have to carry a piece of</font>

340
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,610
traffic across a given link that's cost

341
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,560
more for router

342
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,959
raises costs more for circuits so you're

343
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,250
dropping<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the hop count at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

344
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,469
half with a lot of this peer-to-peer

345
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,060
traffic so that's literally that same

346
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,920
traffic gets to the user that he wanted

347
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,359
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> used half</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network infrastructure</font>

348
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,860
to do it now there's a little difference

349
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,300
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you're reducing more of</font>

350
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,680
the long haul<font color="#CCCCCC"> than less of the regional</font>

351
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,000
but that's still a huge amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

352
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,130
traffic that you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry as</font>

353
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,750
far as you had to before so again

354
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,640
translates into direct dollar savings

355
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,620
just to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of information</font>

356
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:43,189
make the applications a little bit

357
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:46,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">smarter and from the p2p perspective the</font>

358
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,279
simulations yield good delivery results

359
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,380
or slower sorry or shorter download

360
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,899
times so the bottom line in these charts

361
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,250
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to completion so we're</font>

362
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,570
seeing things like a fifty percent or

363
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:01,339
even a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent sorry a</font>

364
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">50-percent to you know having of the</font>

365
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:08,029
download times so what that means is

366
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:12,529
that users get data more predictably and

367
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:14,360
more rapidly while also at lower cost to

368
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:16,310
the ISPs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is all without any</font>

369
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,209
sort of caching infrastructure that you

370
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,189
know the caching folks have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

371
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,779
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is just purely you</font>

372
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,070
know making better decisions the caching

373
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,510
infrastructures you know we're making

374
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,550
cash discovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> as part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard</font>

375
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well just further increases this you</font>

376
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:31,130
know the bandwidth savings and you know

377
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,140
the performance increase so exactly so

378
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,880
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested the p4p working</font>

379
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,790
group is free to<font color="#CCCCCC"> join</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are monthly</font>

380
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,880
meetings where conference calls there's

381
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,910
an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and there's a field test</font>

382
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,850
now underway so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have results from</font>

383
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,410
that shortly and so what we're working

384
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,779
on is we're evaluating the design

385
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,250
through experiments such as this field

386
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">test and they'll be an ongoing series of</font>

387
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:59,779
field<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests then the next steps are to</font>

388
00:14:54,769 --> 00:15:02,480
more formalized the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and work out</font>

389
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:04,100
standardized protocols so going beyond

390
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,199
the proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concept that validates the</font>

391
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:11,930
basic approach to making a more formal

392
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,550
standard and then driving forward

393
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,949
adoption of that and serving<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

394
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,010
ongoing forum for isps<font color="#E5E5E5"> p2p networks to</font>

395
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:21,209
coordinate these sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

396
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,430
so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it i would welcome</font>

397
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:29,100
questions you know what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

398
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:31,050
we're doing it they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all on IRC oh I</font>

399
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,839
can't read the IRC up here if asked oh

400
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,300
yeah that's gonna Mike yeah hi is this

401
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,779
huh yeah yep i'm paul francis from

402
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">cornell so I um I was curious I mean you</font>

403
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,189
have this interface right where you you

404
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,290
have this matrix or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font>

405
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,510
is mathematical thing that happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

406
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,089
probably neither you nor I understand I

407
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,439
was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> why you don't have a for</font>

408
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,540
instance of simpler interface where I

409
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,220
don't know the the pier simply says you

410
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,740
know here's some IP addresses I want to

411
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,500
potentially contact with and the ISP

412
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,240
returns the thing that says you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

413
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,520
give this one wait x and this one wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> y</font>

414
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,970
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pier can decide you know</font>

415
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,529
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on whatever which one is going to</font>

416
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">use i mean i can imagine much simpler</font>

417
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,459
interfaces and some curious as to why

418
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,589
you you came up with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you did</font>

419
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">yells yells original research actually</font>

420
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:20,760
had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach like that but what we</font>

421
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,640
ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> into was the communication volume</font>

422
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,730
between the peer-to-peer networks

423
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,189
tracker and the eye tracker was very

424
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,550
high because you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one query</font>

425
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,410
/ end user announcing in order to say

426
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,689
here's the list of I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 1,500</font>

427
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,459

428
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,010
the best and then get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

429
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:42,689
recommendation specific to that person

430

because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next person who announces it</font>

431
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,260
gets a different recommendation because

they're in a different place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,600
communication overhead was pretty rough

434
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,690
so we ended up moving the map into the

435
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,360
peer-to-peer networks tracker so that it

436
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,790
gets given<font color="#E5E5E5"> this abstracted map so it can</font>

437
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,500
map ip's two locations and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then figure</font>

438
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">out who to connect to who is a local</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

439
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,329
memory operation given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing</font>

440
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,030
thousands of announces a second or tens

441
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,990
of thousands announces a second but we

442
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,209
just couldn't sustain that kind of

443
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,500
communication yeah is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

444
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,120
earlier stuff documented anywhere

445
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I mean that's the sort of thing</font>

446
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,479
that's good to know is to you you you

447
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,429
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of document what you ended up with</font>

448
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,260
but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really how you got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah</font>

449
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,360
and I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> also say that the specific</font>

450
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,910
architecture that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's here is the</font>

451
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:31,770
architecture of this proof-of-concept

452
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,500
test but it's an open dialogue and if

453
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

454
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,760
we end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a different architecture</font>

455
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,639
that solves the problems better we're

456
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,410
very open to that this is our goal right

457
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,750
now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to validate the basic idea</font>

458
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,720
that localizing data transfers improves

459
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,970
performance and saves money which seems

460
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,230
like it ought to be true<font color="#E5E5E5"> but and but the</font>

461
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,890
mechanics of how we do it we're not

462
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,380
particularly tied to this proposal we're

463
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">very open to proposals from Cornell</font>

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,430
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much we've got the proof of</font>

469
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,640
we're essentially at the beginning

<font color="#CCCCCC">stages of you know starting a standard</font>

471

work you know in the formal sense ok now

472
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:18,280
it's cool stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok great Danny</font>

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Macpherson a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then is to</font>

474
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,570
question actually the first was when you

475
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,040
do that optimization and it would seem

476
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me you would have higher peak rates</font>

477
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,300
in the land or from the subside

478
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,800
subscriber distribution side and that's

479
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the larger issues from a</font>

480
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,879
peer-to-peer<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate-limiting perspective</font>

481
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,850
that sort of thing so you know and some

482
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,830
of the data I'd looked at shows that

483
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:42,010
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know topologically like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inter</font>

484
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">domain traffic peer-to-peer isn't a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

485
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,090
significant part of that maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

486
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,250
maybe 12 you know 12 to four percent

487
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,730
maybe of traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain on</font>

488
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:54,430
networks is peer-to-peer traffic as

489
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,990
opposed to localized traffic which could

490
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,180
be you know eighty ninety ninety-five

491
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,130
percent and I know that data is not

492
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,800
published it's not really but the point

493
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that is as you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean are you</font>

494
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,240
solving the wrong problem I would love

495
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,320
that data to be true<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have some</font>

496
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,030
different day that we've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

497
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,470
that says it's it's very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font>

498
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,940
percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of peer-to-peer traffic ends</font>

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,860
up crossing appearing link or trans a

500
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,540
link of some kind so we can definitely

501
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk offline about the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you you've</font>

502
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,470
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's true actually write this</font>

503
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,990
this could encourage you know higher

504
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,980
peak times for the end users but the

505
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,380
brink of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that we didn't make</font>

506
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is purely an optimization sort of</font>

507
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,160
standard exercise any other policies and

508
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,780
procedures an ISP might be trying to

509
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,310
implement is completely separate and

510
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,050
this in no way invalidates anything like

511
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,730
that i mean if someone's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

512
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,470
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of traffic management you can</font>

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">still do those same things but you might</font>

built<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowing</font>

516
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,710
it was the peak<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and then my other</font>

517
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,820
question I was kind of surprised I

518
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,250
didn't see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your slides anywhere</font>

519
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,620
was you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know well no</font>

520
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,420
net neutrality debate and what you know

521
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,040
what you guys might be doing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

522
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,420
technologist perspective to contribute

523
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,090
some clue to that from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that perspective</font>

524
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I followed some of the you know</font>

525
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the legal and regulatory and</font>

526
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,380
even the economic viewpoints on that and

527
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,760
there doesn't seem to be a lot of

528
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology and I think something like</font>

529
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,850
this could contribute positively to that

530
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">well this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a lot of</font>

531
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,000
attention on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that front as well and</font>

532
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,139
quite frankly you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font>

533
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,670
what the internet is supposed to do it's

534
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,680
an industry solution to an industry

535
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,630
problem it's not it's one facet of a

536
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,060
much you know bigger issue but you know

537
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,800
if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of you know stem that</font>

538
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,470
curve that looks like it's a vertical

539
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,090
line almost with bringing HD traffic

540
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,440
onto the net if we can make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

541
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,330
reasonable than all of a sudden that

542
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes the dynamic of what carriers</font>

543
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,240
need to do to manage your infrastructure

544
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,130
so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help with that and</font>

545
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,330
there's many<font color="#CCCCCC"> other ways to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of crack</font>

546
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,190
that enough but this is one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

547
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,919
we can do that's so easy low-hanging

548
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,690
fruit if that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> a benefit from from</font>

549
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,460
an explicit sort of chartering or goals

sort of sort of inputs to be at the SEC

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,990
try to some doubt or the reverse IP yeah

576
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,389
so something some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the p2p networks</font>

577
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,920
use random peer connections like<font color="#CCCCCC"> tinier</font>

578
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,050
generic

579
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,970
torrent sort of approach some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

580
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,460
try to reverse-engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

581
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,640
network structure based on traceroute

582
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,050
your pink times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that and</font>

583
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,360
one of the major ones actually goes out

584
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,960
of its way to connect cross ISPs and

585
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,629
ever possible and avoid inter intra ISP

586
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,380
connections for reasons of their own so

587
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:19,620
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wide range of proprietary</font>

588
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,480
approaches to this and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

589
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,419
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> p 4 p is it should be viewed as</font>

590
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,440
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> an addition to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the</font>

591
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,670
capabilities that p2p applications

592
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,790
already have so if for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP we</font>

593
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,440
have really precise information that can

594
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,870
help us make very good decisions about

595
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,850
these connections will do that if we

596
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,320
don't have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information just peeking</font>

597
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,379
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> piano if we don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

598
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,439
information for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ISP will try to do</font>

599
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,120
good things but obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

600
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,790
successfully and with less precision

601
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,909
than if we have precise data from the

602
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,610
ISP<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the one thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that came to</font>

603
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:59,880
my mind when I saw that matrix was is

604
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:02,459
there any motivations on the last mile

605
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,790
is P side that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would make them want to</font>

606
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,210
look a whole lot less attractive from

607
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:10,680
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world's perspective I'll</font>

608
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,420
essentially use that use this sort of

609
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,920
topology information to discourage

610
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,270
peer-to-peer traffic on there now I

611
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,790
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff on my network</font>

612
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,050
especially as seen from the outside that

613
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,129
kind of thing actually the initial

614
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,840
responses have been sort of the reverse

615
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,970
there was a concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doing this</font>

616
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,980
optimization might accidentally attract

617
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,470
extra peer-to-peer traffic to my network

618
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,550
than was originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended so it's a</font>

619
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">good balance like I think they were</font>

620
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,960
saying it's it's more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

621
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had none or less to start with it</font>

622
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,840
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of augments any of the</font>

623
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,489
protocols I mean the verisign guys have

624
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,990
been pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good about their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tray shot</font>

625
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,030
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> they talk about and sort of</font>

626
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,040
reverse mapping but nothing that the

627
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,080
peer-to-peer guys are doing with sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

628
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,820
reverse engineering the networks and can

629
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,710
possibly include any business

630
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,929
information and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge component</font>

631
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,850
especially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> international ISPs and</font>

632
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,190
anyone who's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Tier one is be you</font>

633
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,419
know there's wide variance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in how much</font>

634
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,580
things cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they may have two</font>

635
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,260
connections to do different ISPs both at

636
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,870
five percent utilization one<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs you</font>

637
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,400
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one doesn't so then being able</font>

638
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,689
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> express that and</font>

639
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,310
you know be part of that communication

640
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,080
process and part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the working group is</font>

641
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:12,149
as much education for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer-to-peer</font>

642
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,530
community in general as it is eunos

643
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,250
appliance information i mean the folks

644
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,450
doing the off net as much as possible

645
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,710
algorithm they didn't do a were evil

646
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,060
they did it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't they</font>

647
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,260
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was somehow better they</font>

648
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,820
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a benefit to that when</font>

649
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,129
it turns out I'm like stop taking money

650
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,450
on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> pocket yeah let's let's let's work</font>

651
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:37,380
on some optimization sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> going the</font>

652
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:39,240
opposite direction so so how are you

653
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,730
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to distribute this data to the</font>

654
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,250
peer-to-peer applications I mean p

655
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,810
repair clients doing like 200 new

656
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,160
connections per second that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

657
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of lookups are going to feed</font>

658
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,150
every application with a BGP feet or

659
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are reports</font>

660
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,860
about are you pleased to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be of the data</font>

661
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,170
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I heard the whole question</font>

662
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,110
there and so how are you can distribute

663
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:03,290
that apology data with our all

664
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">information to the applications</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to class</font>

665
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,520
for for the p2p networks where there is

666
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,790
something like a central tracker that

667
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:15,240
coordinates who should talk to who like

668
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:16,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">BitTorrent that tracker needs to get the</font>

669
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,750
map information and it can use that to

670
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,300
guide which peers it talks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> who the</font>

671
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,970
peers don't have to have that data for

672
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:26,220
the distributed peer-to-peer networks

673
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,250
that's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question and I</font>

674
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,260
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a good answer yet</font>

675
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:34,260
one of the proposed answers is that each

676
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,540
peer asks the eye tracker for guidance

677
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,100
but that then creates a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of load on</font>

678
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye tracker so I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that's</font>

679
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,939
practical so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an area</font>

680
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,380
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to do some research okay</font>

681
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:48,110
yeah they've got some ideas I'd love to

682
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe thank you I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

683
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,629
summarize a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was just</font>

684
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,490
said there I mean generally what you are

685
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,230
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up seeing if every ice P</font>

686
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,240
participated in the standard it's going

687
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look sort of like an offline global</font>

688
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">IGP you know simplify data but I mean</font>

689
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,940
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what you're going to end</font>

690
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,980
up with at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end so you know there's a</font>

691
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot more routing expertise that you know</font>

692
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,350
needs to be brought to the table on how

693
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,540
to really do that efficiently but

694
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,340
effectively you're creating a global<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

695
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,270
database for all the ISPs and the

696
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,290
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules of how they're</font>

697
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,450
interconnected and such so it's

698
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,980
definitely a<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge but again this is</font>

699
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,330
information sharing

700
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,860
gets us a benefit so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot cheaper</font>

701
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:24,960
than put more boxes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more circuits</font>

702
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:27,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">in hmm i think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other question it's</font>

703
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:32,460
like so much the question that's all

704
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:34,830
right I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff Rebecca when i switch quick</font>

705
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,679
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

706
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,320
stop somebody from getting onto a

707
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,240
tracker box and accessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that map</font>

708
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,210
information and maybe set you know

709
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,590
changing the pier information so that

710
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,000
all the piers will connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one</font>

711
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,980
network or another network and

712
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,140
potentially causing a das attack that's

713
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,600
that's legitimate traffic so from a

714
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,610
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> administrator standpoint you</font>

715
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,709
know it could be problematic because it

720
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,409
if the p4p information tells us that all

data<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the planet comes from some poor</font>

00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:20,309
we do now plus one poor guy in taiwan so

724
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,440
it won't hurt us that much we won't gain

725

the benefits will lose the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

728
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,309
now particularly except for one guy in

<font color="#CCCCCC">taiwan and actually that goes to a</font>

little bit like how we're going to

<font color="#E5E5E5">assemble the data and share the data we</font>

say open standard but the reality is i

<font color="#E5E5E5">mean the ISPs you know ourselves</font>

735
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,280
of some rules governing how their data

736
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,449
is is shared to the outside world and

737
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,580
don't know that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be just</font>

739

topology database is most likely going

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,168
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of entity that the</font>

peer-to-peer folks may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

freely available but you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

744
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,520
register you know become you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know except</font>

745
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,600
how you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the data so</font>

746
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,440
but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to work out that's</font>

747
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,000
something we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to</font>

748
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,710
resolve because you're absolutely right

749
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,090
you know there's a security issue there

750
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,890
you can create some sort of problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

751
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,889
it that's we've not done our job well

752
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:12,799
thanks

753
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,799
