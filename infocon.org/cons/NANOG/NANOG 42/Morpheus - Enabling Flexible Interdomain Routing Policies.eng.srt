<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you good morning I'm um from</font>

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:15,619
Princeton today I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:19,050
Morpheus this is a research project with

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:22,080
Janice M Rama porous and my advisor

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,410
Jennifer expert and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I'm here</font>

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:31,380
is to get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback from the</font>

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:35,120
operators about how useful or how would

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,550
you like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this new mechanism to</font>

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,360
actually capitalize your path diversity

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,510
to create a win-win<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation two on one</font>

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,059
hand you can hopefully get more revenue

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,670
out of your current appearing with your

13
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:55,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">neighbors and on the other hand you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,289
you offer better service to customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,809
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know that large ice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> piece have</font>

16
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,470
breached path diversity and hopefully

17
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,270
there will be more peering sessions set

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,110
up after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not because you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,298
wearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the green dots so first from</font>

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,039
some measurement study we know that you

21
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:20,280
know top<font color="#E5E5E5"> two percent of the large ice P</font>

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">past diversity is even further is even</font>

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,450
bigger for example I do some survey on

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,009
you know a lot of some some bleep I said

28
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,649
you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very common to see five to</font>

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:45,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten rather have a path and the different</font>

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,930

just want to avoid some downstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

40
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,149
may want low latency path but some of

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:26,460
them in a want high bandwidth you know

42
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:30,150
different different<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> differ</font>

43
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,610
in terms of performance and given the

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,490
kind of have diversity available in your

45
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,110
eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> peace in your network probably you</font>

46
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,890
can think about how to actually

47
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,290
capitalize them in a better way today

48
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,829
it's we know that your customers may

49
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,040
want different<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths so for example</font>

50
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:52,080
financial companies they heavily

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,929
emphasize the security and the VoIP

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,940
companies the one low latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

53
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,850
content providers they want high

54
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,190
bandwidth nearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> one go closer to the</font>

55
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">eyeballs and many others</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they</font>

56
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,930
are perfect happy with the default

57
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,420
routes so there's no like one size fits

58
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,110
all solution but today<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

59
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,030
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prefer you choose</font>

60
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,540
the one quote unquote best route and

61
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,750
give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everybody so what we propose</font>

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:26,850
here is a routing control platform that

63
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,500
enables ISPs to act alone meaning that

64
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't need to collaborate anybody</font>

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,060
else they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to change their</font>

66
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,480
existing routers but to capitalize their

67
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">path diversity so in the form of the</font>

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,450
talk i'm going to cover two aspects of

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:47,610
this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the kind of supports we</font>

70
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,890
we need to make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work it's all</font>

71
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,470
backward compatible and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second is</font>

72
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the design of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more of your server</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sustained on standalone server a</font>

74
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,750
set of stand-alone servers that actually

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:05,430
computes the route and<font color="#CCCCCC"> push them to the</font>

76

routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of a high</font>

77
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:12,660

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:16,190
a set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> morpheus servers they have ebgp</font>

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:23,789
each of them only take have a subset of

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state and they</font>

communicate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other so each</font>

complete view of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP routes so that</font>

86
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,690
they can select the best out of all the

87
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,580
routes for your edge routers and for

88
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,880
your customers it's worth mentioning

89
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,639
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is not the case today so if you</font>

90
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look you will find different</font>

91
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,740
you're different edge routers in your

92
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,460
network we have different set of routes

93
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,400
to choose from<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's it's clean it's</font>

94
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,409
very very possible none of your routers

95
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,960
have the full picture of all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes</font>

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,270
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbors and this</font>

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,489
argument then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> after choosing</font>

98
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,479
the best routes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mafia service can</font>

99
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:19,080
push down the routes to your edge router

100
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:26,520
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> cigi bgp sessions and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> propose</font>

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:28,680
to use IP or<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpls tunnels between every</font>

102
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,830
pair of edge routers so that you don't

103
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:36,650
you don't need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry the hot potato</font>

104
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:40,620
kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that can cause</font>

105
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:44,880
undesirable shift of traffic load once

106
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,130
some route changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is a</font>

107
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,580
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situation will happen if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you use</font>

108
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,159
Morpheus so even if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer c1 and</font>

109
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,789
c2 are connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same edge router</font>

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,220
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually reach the same</font>

111
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:02,760
destination through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> path so</font>

112
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,490
that it gives you more flexibility to

113
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,669
providing you know customized service to

114
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,130
our customers and the support are

115
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,789
already there you know the vrf from

116
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">cisco and virtual router from june</font>

117
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:23,300
credit are readily available for to

118
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:26,340
realize this kind of customization and

119
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,180
now i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to switch gear to talk</font>

120
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,099
about the design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Morpheus server</font>

121
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,190
to understand why we take the following

122
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,260
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point three</font>

123
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,090
limitations of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP design the first</font>

124
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,699
is an overloading of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

125
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,250
tributes we all know that there are not

126
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,380
a lot of knobs to tweak but actually

127
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,560
they are not enough because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

128
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,780
overloading it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you tweak the local</font>

129
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,440
preference to support both bgp

130
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,030
relationship and the traffic engineering

131
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,040
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you may get used to it because</font>

132
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,039
you did every day but actually it's

133
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,680
quite messy and it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,260
new policies because of that for example

135
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you want add security as a new policy</font>

136
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,200
objective to the whole route selection

137
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:16,799
process you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to think about</font>

138
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">which nap should i use the second</font>

139
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,320
limitation is the difficulty in

140
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:24,090
incorporating SATA information let's

141
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,430
take one step back and think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

142
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,830
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an ideal way to select routes</font>

143
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,000

144
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,969
information to help you with that

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,610
process for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example externally you won't</font>

146
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,800
get some measurement data to tell you

147
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,960
which path is actually better it's

148
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,580
closer to my customer or is it has

149
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,680
doesn't have high bandwidth for example

150
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,289
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you won't have you no business</font>

152
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,130
ownership all these kind of things you

153
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will help you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand</font>

154
00:07:53,130 --> 00:08:00,150
certain property of the path either

155
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:03,599
performance or security or so and so

156
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,580
forth so today<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's quite hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

157
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,580
incorporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> those information to your</font>

158
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:14,130
the resurrection process<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so given</font>

159
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,669
that to limitations what we propose is a

160
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:21,840
different approach before the actual

161
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:25,049
route selection process we<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce a</font>

162
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,349
set of modules called classifiers each

163
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,510
classifier does<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one job so one</font>

164
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:34,439
classifier will take a look at the

165
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,809
royalton<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tag this</font>

166
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,250
route learned from my customer with the

167
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:42,900
numerical number and four routes learn

168
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,810
from my peer or provided i'm going to

169
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,480
tag with different numbers and another

170
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,979
to classify who is taking care of

171
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,660
performances will look at all the routes

172
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,860
and say oh

173
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,410
this routes according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my measurement</font>

174
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,149
infrastructure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's has it has the</font>

175
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,910
lowest latency so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag it</font>

176
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:04,879
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number so each classifier will</font>

177
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,740
only look at one property of the routes

178
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:11,540
and tag it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make any</font>

179
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,430
judgment and doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make any rejection</font>

180
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,410
in terms of filtering it will only take

181
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the route and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> propagate all the routes</font>

182
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:22,129
to the decision process and it's

183
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,490
desirable because it because of the

184
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:27,170
modular design it's very easy to add new

185
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,310
classifiers if you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

186
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:33,949
introduce a new policy objective in your

187
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,939
decision process and we also envision

188
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:39,829
you know something it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very likely</font>

189
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:43,550
different teams even<font color="#E5E5E5"> different vendors</font>

190
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:45,649
can come up with good modules so that

191
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:49,180
actually they can evolve independently

192
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:51,500
in fact there are a lot of nice

193
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,130
algorithm coming up in the research

194
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,290
community that can detect say previous

195
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,630
hijacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a very efficient way so</font>

196
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,329
they can just contribute their code in

197
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,639
some way you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put it wrap them</font>

198
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:06,349
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a module sorry wrap them into a</font>

199
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,149
module then you know everybody can

200
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:15,709
benefit from that the third limitation

201
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP is it strictly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ranked one attribute</font>

202
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:21,018
over another so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way you can</font>

203
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,810
make trade-offs between<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

204
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:26,810
objectives here's example you know if

205
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,000
our paths<font color="#E5E5E5"> are somewhat unstable then</font>

206
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,849
pick the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most stable path of any length</font>

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,370
it could be from up here but otherwise

208
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,709
pick the shortest path through a

209
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,720
customer it's very reasonable trade-off

210
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:40,790
between a business relationship and a

211
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,110
stability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of hard to do it</font>

212
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:48,349
today so what we propose to address this

213
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:52,189
problem is to use a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

214
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,949
pick the best best routes instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

215
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:57,259
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> step-by-step ranking we use a</font>

216
00:10:54,949 --> 00:11:00,589
weighted sum so don't be confused by

217
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:03,769
this notations<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the idea is now</font>

218
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:04,190
after this set of classifiers each route

219
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:07,100
we

220
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,220
have a set of some metadata right hey

221
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,490
they will have attacked for each policy

222
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,830
objective so you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify a weight</font>

223
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,110
for each objective then you compute

224
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,090
weighted sum which<font color="#E5E5E5"> however had the</font>

225
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:25,370
highest score<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be the preferred</font>

226
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:28,460
route and because you're different

227
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:32,930
customers may have different preference

228
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:36,260
over the routes so that translates<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

229
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:40,160
a different sets of weights for the

230
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,460
policy objectives so in Morpheus we

231
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,990
support multiple decision processes

232
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,000
there's no reason you can't you give you

233
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the advances</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,710
multi-core you know there's no reason

235
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,800
you can't run multiple decision process

236
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:58,130
in parallel<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here decision process</font>

237
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,430
a may you know be set such that it

238
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:04,400
always pick the shortest latency path

239
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:08,089
but decision process<font color="#CCCCCC"> be they may prefer</font>

240
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,160
the most secure path for example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

241
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:16,400
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weights differently</font>

242
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:18,140
and then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you're you can export</font>

243
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,850
the different routes to different

244
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:24,740
customers according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their preferences</font>

245
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:28,660
for example we have a product prototype

246
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:35,060
implementation based on zorp and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

247
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:37,490
we we implement several classifiers in a

248
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:42,250
pipeline because that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how job</font>

249
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:46,460
implement its information flow and we

250
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:48,740
support multiple decision processes we

251
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">do some evaluation and we found the</font>

252
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,000
classifier actually can work very

253
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">efficiently the most complicated one in</font>

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,940
which we implement a research proposal

255
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,620
of identifying previous hijacking it

256
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,190
takes only about one-tenth of a

257
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:06,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">millisecond to classify route and then</font>

258
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,850
we look at the total decision time which

259
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,650
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in Morpheus it's just the</font>

260
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:15,580
computation<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weighted sum so</font>

261
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,579
it's very quick you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

262
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,280
there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 routes / prefix it's</font>

263
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually faster than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP a</font>

264
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,230
decision process because in that at

265
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,530
least in the implementation absorb what

266
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:32,470
it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will take look at this</font>

267
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:35,260
prefix and go back to all the peers to

268
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,660
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether they have this the route to</font>

269
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,850
the same prefix and achieve that route

270
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,469
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that compare through the</font>

271
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:46,110
step-by-step process that's actually

272
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:48,670
much slower and we did we set up a

273
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,690
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you've got its</font>

274
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:56,050
throughput in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup we have 40 pops</font>

275
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,920
and each more one more fish server in

276
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:02,800
each pop and each morpheus server

277
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,719
maintain this many ebgp high bgp

278
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,229
sessions and the sessions between the

279
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">morpheus service and we inject 20 routes</font>

280
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:15,700
prefix what we found is very promising

281
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:18,730
because the x-axis is the number of

282
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,220
decision processes run in parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

283
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,040
y-axis is the throughput of updates

284
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:28,420
processed per second so as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

285
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:31,449
the decrease is very slow so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even</font>

286
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:36,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we are running 40 decision process in</font>

287
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:39,340
parallel we only get one one-eighth of

288
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:42,160
loss of the throughput<font color="#E5E5E5"> pisode it's</font>

289
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,590
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying you know</font>

290
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,110
you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to run 40 different</font>

291
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:50,680
decision process but the performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

292
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,600
there and finally other one to mention

293
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no threat to stability</font>

294
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,230
because for large as peace most of your

295
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:02,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers are stops so even if you give</font>

296
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,110
them non-coding quote non-default routes

297
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,610
they are not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> propagate this</font>

298
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,640
route to anybody else they are just

299
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:13,180
using them their selves so there's no

300
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,610
stability concerns and actually that's

301
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,430
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover details here but</font>

302
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:23,170
actually we also have a way for transit

303
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:26,079
ases to provide customer routes to their

304
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,910
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and without causing stability</font>

305
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,740
problems if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more about</font>

306
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,000
that we can't

307
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:35,700
offline okay in summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> morpheus provide</font>

308
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,510
a simple practical way to for a species

309
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,950
to capitalize their path diversity it's

310
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,740
significantly more flexible than what we

311
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,230
have now introduced no impact on

312
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,899
stability it's efficient and scalable

313
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,200
enough for even large ice piece and it's

314
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:56,000
backward compatible so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

315
00:15:52,200 --> 00:16:01,279
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have questions for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,589
what are your top policy objectives and

317
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,080
you know I over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two days</font>

318
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:09,420
actually i chat with some of you and got

319
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,220
very nice feedback about your practical

320
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,920
concerns<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to learn more about that</font>

321
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:18,420
and because the way the way you need you

322
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,029
need to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> the weights for the</font>

323
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,120
different policy objectives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

324
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:26,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually give some of control to your</font>

325
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,950
customers if you want so what how much

326
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,170
control you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are willing to give your</font>

327
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers or you are only willing to say</font>

328
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,819
I have several choices for you to choose

329
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyway I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not gonna let you</font>

330
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,660
touch my router I'm gonna just pick the

331
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,359
routes for you but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will let you choose</font>

332
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,760
which type of rats you want and any

333
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,829
other practical concerns so very

334
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting feedbacks and collaborations</font>

335
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:51,770
and here's the link<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the technical</font>

336
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,770
report thank

337
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,920
hi can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the graph you had</font>

338
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:08,179
at the beginning showing the multiple

339
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,859
routes the explanation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for how you're</font>

340
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:15,050
choosing your rots is very well done

341
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:17,899
I'll is it the question I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is how</font>

342
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:20,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">does our three make a decision to route</font>

343
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,880
traffic from c1 or c2 differently

344
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,069
because choosing your destination is one

345
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,290
thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this seems to imply that</font>

346
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:30,080
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> choosing a path based on a source</font>

347
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're using stock routers how</font>

348
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,320
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that without you know</font>

349
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,880
redirection lists or some other

350
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:42,320
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so your question is how</font>

351
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:45,920
does our three know how to for the

352
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,800
tractor from c1 to c2 differently using

353
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,730
existing technologies right exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

354
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:57,559
so this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question because we</font>

355
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:59,809
use tunnels so that we can tunnel we can

356
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:03,980
use tunnels different tunnels for

357
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:06,800
traffic from c1 c2 and that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

358
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:10,820
end of the tunnel could be the outgoing

359
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,950
interface of our three instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

360
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,010
income interface of our three so that

361
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:19,910
Utah no actually I forgot the exact term

362
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:22,250
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can in mpls you can tunnel to</font>

363
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:27,080
the outgoing interface in fact you can't

364
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:31,520
unknow to the interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> of art r 6 and r</font>

365
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,678
7 right then you can right<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

366
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,610
traffic leaves the outgoing interface

367
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:42,700
from r3 to our six you strip off the

368
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,699
header then you know it's going that way

369
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:53,960
ready

Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush IJ e after some decades of</font>

371
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:05,270
getting resilience through distribution

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:14,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">illogic space I wonder what happens when</font>

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:19,350
the central server<font color="#E5E5E5"> fails to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the routers</font>

375
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:22,080
recover and go back to normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

376
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:26,969
Rani's question is what if one of the

377
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:32,309
Morpheus server fails is that quite know

378
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:35,970
it was when not what if when when it

379
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:39,030
fails yes they will fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's a</font>

380
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">good question and it's not a new</font>

381
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,649
question because it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font>

382
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,580
question it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> old question asking a</font>

383
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,260
new scenario so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it Oh</font>

384
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:52,559
answer for that it's a typical

385
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:55,289
distribution system so conceptually each

386
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Morpheus server will have a centralized</font>

387
00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:01,890
complete view of your routes it's a

388
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:04,200
desirable thing what we want it but to

389
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:07,440
avoid single point of failure what we

390
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:11,400
use is first we use multiple more<font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

391
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,880
servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and second although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's too</font>

392
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,000
messy to show here what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are</font>

393
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:21,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to happen is you know each edge</font>

394
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,020
router will appear with two more<font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

395
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:27,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers okay and that that creates kind</font>

396
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:31,139
of redundancy already in place today you

397
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:33,690
know your backbone router will appear

398
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:38,630
each of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are say access router will</font>

399
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,630
appear with 12 of your back by others

400
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,090
yeah you're telling me why it won't fail

401
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,490
everything we know that it won't fail

402
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:58,740
has failed yeah so what's going to

403
00:20:50,490 --> 00:21:01,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen when it failed okay so even if</font>

404
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:09,480
one of them fails it you can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

405
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:11,150
routes updates sooner or later more than

406
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,590
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fail that's Randy's</font>

407
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:17,580
everything fails eventually usually it

408
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:19,709
awkward times okay then you know we are

409
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:25,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">here the previous talk and can use the</font>

410
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:27,630
course for restart you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

411
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,340
remember what happened when AT&T put in

412
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:34,770
one bad bite and all the e5 ESS which is

413
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,918
you know and all the switches went out

414
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:41,549
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> East</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Coast the control plane</font>

415
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,380
fails you know the brilliant engineers

416
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:45,929
will try to bring them back as soon as

417
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,860
possible what meanwhile you know that

418
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:53,480
the data plane cans the meanwhile the

419
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:56,459
data plane has do keep forwarding and

420
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,580
that the part that the I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font>

421
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,130
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know multiple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions is just</font>

422
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,139
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the probability of two of them</font>

423
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,120
fail at the same time will be much much

424
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,040
lower than one of them fail so even if

425
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,860
one of them fails you know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

426
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,629
life-threatening you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can still get the</font>

427
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,629
route updates from another server

428
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:21,010
on the same slide you mentioned about

429
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">morphus connections between Morfa</font>

430
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:26,320
servers to share the information is that

431
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,690
proprietary or how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement that</font>

432
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,060
is it like some sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP session</font>
