00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:08,510
next up we have Paul Ferguson from Trend

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:13,040
Micro speaking on law enforcement

control out<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks that sounds a lot</font>

5
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,170
more impressive than what it actually is

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,150
anyway I'm Paul Ferguson and work for

7
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">two micro and I wear a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,860
different hats but one of them is a lot

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,300
of outreach to law enforcement and

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,360
non-governmental organizations as well

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,870
as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp community but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before I start</font>

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,420
into this let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me preface this with a</font>

13
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:11,890
couple of items here just say let you

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:15,130
know what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not so this doesn't</font>

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:19,570
really is not really geared towards what

16
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,550
i would consider to be strictly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs</font>

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,259
that are just bit shippers they just

18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,960
pick up the bits on one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> and spit</font>

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:29,200
them out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other however the they're</font>

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,630
orthogonal<font color="#CCCCCC"> e related because some of</font>

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,360
these issues will probably overlap into

22
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,460
their a of a responsibility so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,160
really these are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not issues that</font>

35
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,360
we're really having a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of problems</font>

although<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are problems they're just</font>

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,450
outside the united states mostly in

Europe and a lot in Asia and other parts

of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> where on the contact</font>

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,738
for a particular incident is either

45
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:34,989
incorrect or outdated but I'll get to

46
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:39,730
that let's see so let's see what's the

47
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:42,820
problem we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have things like</font>

48
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">Code Red outbreaks and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advan virus</font>

49
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,108
outbreaks like we use and worm outbreaks

50
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,850
like we used to do now basically it's

51
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:54,650
all financially motivated

52
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:56,690
and it basically the predominant threats

53
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs may consider is against their</font>

54
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,870
infrastructure and rightly so because

55
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,810
that's where most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your money is</font>

56
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">going but for the most part a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

57
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,830
these type of criminals aren't going

58
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,180
after the infrastructure with denial of

59
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,590
service attacks they'd like to keep the

60
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,050
infrastructure in place because<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

61
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,940
disruption<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the connectivity you know</font>

62
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,370
puts an air gap between them and their

63
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,560
victims<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gain money</font>

64
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,780
so the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're really seeing</font>

65
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,130
DDoS is and people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arbor Danny and</font>

66
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,680
someone else come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so most time</font>

67
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:28,850
is when somebody pisses these guys off

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,790
or it's an international<font color="#CCCCCC"> activist type</font>

69
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,410
of incident or somebody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

70
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,209
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> is taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money out of their</font>

71
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,250
pocket and they just did awesome off the

72
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,900
face of the earth so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

73
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,460
these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are basically just for</font>

74
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,980
financially profit motive and the

75
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,500
sophistication and the level and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

76
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,790
the sheer volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the website and web</font>

77
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,300
server compromises that we're seeing

78
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,160
these days is enough to boggle the mind

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,100
in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> just here recently we had a very</font>

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">large one in the UK that was geared it's</font>

81
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,510
not and these aren't just necessarily

82
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,940
just windows user issues I'm all these

83
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">are now going to a mac and mac OS OS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font>

85
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,830
hosting platforms are getting

86
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,490
compromised and these hosting facilities

87
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,260
and injecting individual HTML injection

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,260
with malicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I frame</font>

90
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,310
elsewhere them actually contain these

91
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,990
exploit engines so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing is</font>

92
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,120
literally thousands and sometimes even

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundreds of thousands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of websites web</font>

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,660

95
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,240
an order of magnitude a larger number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,330
compromise users and basically unwitting

botnet zombies and basically botnets you

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> contrary to popular belief aren't</font>

99
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,489
just used for deed offices they're also

100
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,469
rented out in other criminal endeavors

101
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,320
they're used for spamming they're used

102
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:50,270
for financial fraud and things of that

103
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,650
nature click fraud and this is kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the subtitle this presidential could be</font>

105
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,979
more or less like lessons learned these

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,140
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the issues that we're seeing</font>

107
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,229
the security community that we're trying

108
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to overcome and it leaves basically for</font>

109
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:04,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">those of us to try to go and notify</font>

110
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,880
the victims because notifying the user

111
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,200
is coming at the problem from a

112
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,120
completely different angle which is

113
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">already happening to it you know bites</font>

114
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,760
by its own inertia<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we also have how</font>

115
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,370
we contact these hosting providers how

116
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,370
we contact the owners<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP address</font>

117
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">basis the domains and regional contacts</font>

118
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,830
and there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are frameworks in place</font>

119
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,090
to address that but I sent an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email out</font>

120
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,620
to the list last night I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

121
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,429
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people saw it was basically preface</font>

122
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,960
it in here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've already submitted my</font>

123
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,040
slides that I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to do</font>

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,349
so there's a couple of really good

125
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,540
studies that came out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reinforced</font>

126
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,240
some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing one</font>

127
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,880
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is the fact that we're seeing a</font>

128
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,310
large rise of malicious rogue or

129
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,350
misconfigured DNS resolvers some of em

130

are sitting on infected botnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts on</font>

residential dsl machines have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,780
if you can strap extrapolate that to all

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns resolvers on the internet that's</font>

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,680
other study was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> google analyzing</font>

146
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,650
billions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> urls have found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,690

148
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,669
that were malicious or led to malicious

149
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,760
content so what we have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

150
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:40,010
threat vector now is moving into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web</font>

151
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,180
we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to tell people those</font>

152
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,060
a vulnerability that came out an

153
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,060
operating system or at a browser or in a

154
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,800
third-party application and it was a

155
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,290
patch for yet you know the standard

156
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,360
device used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be well you know make</font>

157
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you patch run antivirus yada yada</font>

158
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,990
yada and don't surf to the bad side of

159
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,340
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that kind of</font>

160
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">advice doesn't really hold water anymore</font>

161
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,770
because what even trusted websites now

162
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,770
are falling victim because what we see

163
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,750
is we have even even here in California

164
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,400
we've had several incidents of local

165
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,740
county governments who don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IT</font>

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,239

167
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,600
outsource the maintenance of their

to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party some consultant will</font>

170
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,360
come in put up a website for them and

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,130
collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> their money and go on their way</font>

172
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,400
and if there's ever a vulnerability is

173
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,710
found and say like you know apache or

174
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,239
cpanel or I ass or whatever there's

175
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,979
nobody ever around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font>

176
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,810
patch it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically you've got you</font>

177
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,460
know hordes of bad guys out there

178
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,770
they're scanning vast numbers of IP

180
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,000

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,450
their foothold in and somebody you know

182

like deploying honeypot sandbox as a

reverse engineering malware malicious

JavaScript doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> AV signatures we're</font>

204
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,679
doing IP reputation because we owned the

<font color="#CCCCCC">rbl plus the used to belong to maps</font>

that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to find fast flux</font>

209
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,380
we're integrating all this in the cloud

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,550
stuff not not into down on the client

211

side anymore we're doing it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,359
clouds as references for like you've

<font color="#E5E5E5">known your malicious urls and things</font>

214
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,300
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're quicker to implement it</font>

215
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,280
keeps the code size small all the

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's kind of the way the industry is</font>

going because we don't really define<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

direction of we go the bad guys do it

for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. william we're trying to</font>

to compromise window down from the time

a vulnerability is exploited and the

time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cleaned up or patch and</font>

removed

235
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,260
basically the sheer<font color="#CCCCCC"> volume sometimes</font>

236
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,260
when you know how do you notify the

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some of the issues that we've</font>

dealt whether the course of the past

00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple years the second goal is find the</font>

242
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,459
criminals behind this stuff and that's

243
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,120
sometimes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of their you know there are geopolitical</font>

245
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,790
issues at work here there are

246
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,029
international extradition and

247
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,130
evidentiary things that have to be

248
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:12,930
adhered to and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the law that doesn't work</font>

249
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,279
a lot but actually in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

250
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,989
years I've actually worked with FBI

cybercrime and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Secret Service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,709
tracked down a couple of individuals on

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:29,339
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that investigation is ongoing bad</font>

256
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,290
guys make mistakes sometimes which means

257
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know we have a few staff</font>

258

00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:37,260
enforcement working with the National

263
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,529
registrar's and basically when you're

264
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,630
having to reach out and touch each

265

individual organizations to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal</font>

266
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:52,980
channels things massively fall through

267
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,329
the cracks so for instance how many

268
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,019
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you tried to notify somebody</font>

269
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:59,790
at an abuse desk abuse at<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain contact</font>

270
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,860
and it fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a black hole never to</font>

271
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,300
be heard of again well this is these<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

272
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,790
type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of issues that we're talking about</font>

273
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,459
which basically am falls into a

274
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,899
black hole or on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other side when it</font>

275
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,250
actually works they've got to automate a

276
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,510
response system where they automatically

277
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,920
generated ticket number and a phone

278
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,240
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call and</font>

check<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the status of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ticket those</font>

280
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,209
are the very few and far between good

281
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:23,130
times so but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things here is</font>

282
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,180
I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the language of what</font>

know you know hackers crackers malware

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,319
activity we're seeing now is actually

300

organized crime and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember who</font>

mistake the criminals follow the money

312
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,149
it's all financial enterprise now and we

<font color="#E5E5E5">near future I was a little irritated</font>

they were trying to to get at but allow

327
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:21,029
thing is most of this crime is happening

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">not through very resource intensive</font>

brute force attacks brute force SSH

stuff that's that's too difficult

332
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,820
there's enough low-hanging fruit out

333
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,089
there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this a multi-million</font>

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,320
much more convoluted and it's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

do it you know for fun games or business

these same systems for criminal purposes

so the goal and the desired results this

00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:23,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">is kind of lesson learned is like try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

398
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,389
up with the news one of the reasons

399
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,790
right now why there hasn't been a real

400
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:15,399
backlash against this type of behavior

401
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,230
is because if you notice a fraudulent

402
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,610
charge in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> card for a couple</font>

403
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,930
hundred dollars what do you do you go to

404
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">your bank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say hey there's a frolic</font>

406
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,839
a couple hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> bucks they launched an</font>

408
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,199
you get it credited back your account no

409
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,180
problem you get a new card you're back

410
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,670
in business so therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

incentivized really to change your

behavior that's starting to change

413
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,550
slightly and maybe not going to say it's

414
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:40,839
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consumer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protection laws but</font>

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,649
the consumer angle because that's

439
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,070
already happening from a lot of

larger agenda elsewhere so what happens

471
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,970
there's a lot of times more and more law

579
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:10,950
all service providers follow or are even

580
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,330
aware of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these guidelines so</font>

581
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,070
we're also trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop relation</font>

582
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,080
with corporate abuse of fraud<font color="#CCCCCC"> context to</font>

583
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,809
it's an ongoing effort lots of

584
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,100
challenges need to develop processed

585
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:21,960
immediately directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to organizations</font>

586
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,510
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on it the biggest</font>

587
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,980
challenges is internal process it's not

588
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,150
just process but disciplined it's like

589
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the same thing every time it's</font>

590
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:32,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">very hard because what we found is that</font>

591
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,480
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to be able to rely on</font>

592
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,400
who has information for technical

593
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,669
contacts but you know there's two

594
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,130
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues here we found the</font>

595
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:43,700
domain portion of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is registry is</font>

596
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:46,530
completely unreliable for the most part

597
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:50,340
it might be correct for people who are

598
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,809
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know are good actors and but it may</font>

599
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,399
be completely incorrect<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those who</font>

600
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,590
are bad actors there's no there's no

601
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,080
check mechanism there to keep bad actors

602
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,879
from abusing that the only real good

603
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,960
information there is the the name server

604
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,539
information you can track that

605
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,340
historically as a passive DNS or passive

606
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,320
aggressive DNS type of back in automated

607
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,459
system but trying to find technical

608
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,840
contacts for who owes those domains

609
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,880
forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it we found with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR</font>

610
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,039
side the IP allocation side of the whois

611
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,000
database is generally pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate</font>

612
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,700
because basically we're dealing with

613
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,590
here is allocation information at least

614
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,960
within Aaron policies if you sub

615
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,250
allocate you're required to slip it I

616
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,490
don't know if requires the right word

617
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,870
right your courage to I think most of

618
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,159
the ripe allocations are several

619
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,530
occasions or occurs to do the same thing

620
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,450
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> for generally the technical contacts</font>

621
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,730
for the IP address space are pretty good

622
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">but they meant not might not be the same</font>

a very uniquely positioned in a very

631
00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:00,399
here because I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been several</font>

632
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,259

some people in favor of those type of

00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,940
things and some people they're not quite

<font color="#CCCCCC">a favorite maybe that's something that</font>

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe i'll pick discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back up on</font>

639
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:16,629
again if that's within the framework of

640
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:19,299
nano that's that's for you to decide I

641
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:20,769
know the ripe does it they have wiped

642
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:23,109
out working groups actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for routing</font>

643
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:26,019
and security and you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

644
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:27,428
nature it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be a right fit for now</font>

645
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:30,129
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean at least there would be</font>

646
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:32,169
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know to consider it</font>

647
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:34,149
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if we don't find some cut</font>

648
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:35,679
way to process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and communicate with the</font>

00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:37,089
stakeholders<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this and you know we're</font>

650
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,369
already behind the bad guys as it is

651
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:42,428
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of them there's more money</font>

652
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:44,738
in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically</font>

653
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:46,419
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dog paddle and stay afloat</font>

654
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:52,389
basically to mitigate the threats an

655
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:53,649
ongoing basis so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> summary I mean we're</font>

656
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:55,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of like on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right path but</font>

657
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:58,268
there's a lot there's been lots of

658
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:01,299
course corrections and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

659
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:02,979
like communicating from from us who

660
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,529
basically what we're doing is we're

661
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:07,239
seeing the threats in real time or in

662
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,549
semi real-time compromise we running

663
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:11,109
across like you know the same embedded

664
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:13,329
malicious JavaScript the points of some

665
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:17,259
compromise server and you know say China

666
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:20,109
or Brazil whatever on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten thousand web</font>

667
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:21,729
pages across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet what we're</font>

668
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:24,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do is trying to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

669
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:27,129
some way to notify the appropriate

670
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,359
people to help get that cleaned up

671
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,498
because there are some that are out

672
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,879
there you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there right now</font>

673
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:36,669
look on there are lots of gov and dot

674
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:39,488
edu which you know so that sometimes a

675
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:41,919
swamp as it is but websites that are

676
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:45,009
hosting links to everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from child</font>

677
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:48,279
porn to fake canadian pharmacy sites to

678
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:49,989
actually malicious code and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

679
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,230
successful and the problem is i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

680
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:53,210
a lot larger than most

681
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,150
folks in this room giving give credence

682
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,190
to so there's a larger effort that need

683
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,320
to be taken here and then I'll

684
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,179
communities act as one voice and I'd

685
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to and be able to gauge</font>

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,570
engaged I must say we me myself and I in

721
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,090
trim but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> also been part of these</font>

722
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,700
discussions on specific a SS is very

723
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific prefixes that are known bad</font>

724
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,410
actors why they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> still allowed to</font>

725
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:52,490
even advertisement routes on the

726
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:55,460
internet and it continued and continued

727
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:57,620
and continued until<font color="#CCCCCC"> they decide to</font>

728
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,630
withdraw withdraw them themselves and

729
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,320
diversify their operations into other

730
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">shadier corners</font>

731
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,080
they're still there there is now

732
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:10,830
diversified so I I don't know the answer

733
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the this community is in charge of</font>

734
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a feeling it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has that</font>

735
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:20,789
will hear some some reasoning along the

736
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:24,120
lines of you know our policy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

737
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:27,870
don't black hole route entire blocks<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:31,229
address space because of foo or whatever

739
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:34,379
but you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the answer</font>

740
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:39,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that question Don I see you at the</font>

742
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,759
might call to a cisco systems I you

743
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,370
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for some suggestions on</font>

00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:56,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">nyack several years ago was actually the</font>

748
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:59,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of a slash security page on a</font>

749
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,440
website that would give you information

750
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,860
on how to contact the various contacts

751
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,950
at a company when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do need to some</font>

752
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,719
incident response support and then you

753
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,179
know that would go for isps and even

754
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,279
customers of ISPs you know certainly I

755
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,110
think it's a good idea to advise your

756
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,700
customers put up a slash security page

757
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,830
it says if you've got abuse going on

758
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,480
with your domain here's a great way of

759
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,100
contacting them because we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

760
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,750
route and postmaster mill goes

761
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,428
unanswered in most places it just goes

762
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:29,460
into a black hole I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so</font>

763
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:33,809
basically my frustrations is to try to

764
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,980
do due diligence to try to contact the

765
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:36,629
people to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to clean up their mess</font>

766
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I mean a lot some people</font>

767
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:41,668
are just ignorant of fact or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pathetic</font>

768
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,459
of the fact or<font color="#E5E5E5"> either just there's no</font>

769
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:45,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">contact information for them I mean the</font>

770

General Services Administration almost

771
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:51,959
pulled the entire domain domain

somebody got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and stop them from</font>

777
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,090
doing that but it would have basically

778
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,220
crippled all domain resolution for CA

779
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,959
gov because they even<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a lot</font>

780
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,889
of there's some ignorance there too but

781
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's really lacking is process and you</font>

782
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:15,809
know we myself and several other people

783
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:18,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the security community try for</font>

784
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:22,620
several times to contact them we sent

785
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,909
email to the people there and the kind

786
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,110
of funny thing about is the person who

787
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:27,419
was possible for thought it was a

788
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,559
phishing email we tried to explain him

789
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,340
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a security problem they said if</font>

790
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,190
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a fish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

791
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,840
deleted it so we picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the phone and</font>

792
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:38,789
called him to they feigned ignorance

793
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,500
question yes I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quick</font>

794
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:44,399
point in the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the talk you</font>

795
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,860
mentioned a port scanning being a bad

796
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,299
activity and anything that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

797
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,158
activity should be called criminal

798
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,299
wanted to make a point that port

799
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,500
scanning is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> action criminal and</font>

800
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:58,110
contrast this<font color="#CCCCCC"> with copyright</font>

801
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,529
infringement which is by definition

802
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:03,600
criminal how come we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really so</font>

803
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:07,559
concerned about port scanning so much

804
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:11,158
and not copyright<font color="#CCCCCC"> infringement which is</font>

805
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,928
a organized crime not that I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

806
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">this but I want to make a point that</font>

807
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay our analogy of things does not</font>

808
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:22,918
necessarily imply that causality of

809
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:25,439
things well I not not to pick it<font color="#CCCCCC"> knit</font>

810
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,490
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily the act of</font>

811
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,379
port skating I mean everybody should

812
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,700
know the Internet is a very noisy place

813
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,369
and they should know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

814
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">practice to protect them from that noise</font>

815
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:35,189
but it's it's it's not just so

816
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">attractive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poor skating but it's just</font>

817
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,789
like scanning vulnerability scanning and

818
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,129
then explain this vulnerable those

819
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:42,539
vulnerabilities that could be considered

820
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:45,289
criminal act depending on the law of

821
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:48,389
that particular jurisdiction we have had

822
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:53,759
convictions in fitment of people for

823
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:57,360
scanning a bank<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you slice next</font>

824
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,369
comes running out of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so okay</font>

825
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,619
so only questions from people at the

826
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:03,619
microphones now is that ok no

827
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:11,000
all right 30 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I'd be happy</font>

828
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,780
to talk to anybody later in the hallway

829
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,780
thank you
