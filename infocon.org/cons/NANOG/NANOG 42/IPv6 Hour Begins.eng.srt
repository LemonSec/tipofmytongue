00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,029
I mean we have two presentations and we

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,250
have the ipv6 are so before our first

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,370
speaker comes on I dislike to hand you

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:16,830
over to Randy bush who's just going to

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:23,698
say a few words about the ipv6 are Randy

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:26,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bush iij um you own the v4 lands have</font>

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,099
been turned off you will notice that you

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,950
probably don't have useful connectivity

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:37,050
even if you're a v6 expert I am a

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,829
scientist in part of my life that<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't</font>

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,000
the operator part and failure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as</font>

12
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:49,530
good as success in an experiment there

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,519
is not a single component of this

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,300
experiment which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> not had bugs I'll</font>

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,739
start at the top of the stack on Mac Mac

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:08,429
OS Thunderbird and firefox by default

17
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:16,080
have dns resolution / v6 turned off<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:19,979
um you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Macintosh if you put in the</font>

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,280
v6 DNS servers address if it has a

20
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:30,869
capital A in it the capital a gets

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:34,890
dropped isn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> lovely um pardon not</font>

22
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tiger though um there are equal</font>

23
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,829
problems in vista as you know when XP

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:48,798
doesn't even do dns resolution / v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

25
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:53,008
ISC dhcpv6 we have found problems the

26
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:56,520
cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> nat PT in the routers we found</font>

27
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,590
problems the linux-based and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,579
you can't get out really right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is</font>

29
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,820
the linux-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat PT we substituted in</font>

30
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,639
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> scaling you know if there were</font>

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,169
four of you it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> succeed there look</font>

32
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,079
like they're even more than four people

33
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:16,049
here

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,390
our purpose of operators and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

35
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,970
as operators is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what it</font>

36
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,420
takes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the network work we now</font>

37
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a nice list of things to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work on to</font>

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,929
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back with the vendors and get them</font>

39
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:34,440
fixed so this experiment by me has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

40
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,430
as successful as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be you will</font>

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,579
have poor connectivity for the next hour

42
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,330
but you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good speakers and I'll</font>

43
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,330
leave you to them
