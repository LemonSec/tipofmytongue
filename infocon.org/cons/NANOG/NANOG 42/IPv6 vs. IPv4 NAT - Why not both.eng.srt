4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,590
in doing this and I'll explain a little

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,340
bit what this is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a minute but</font>

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,410
when I started to implement ipv6 on my

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,330
network in a more production fashion and

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,040
in a more comprehensive rollout than the

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,949
sort of experimental fashion that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,839
I was interested in finding ways to

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,399
dramatically reduce our consumption at

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,100
least our consumption rate of ipv4

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,660
addresses if not turning off ipv4 so of

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,500
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I naturally became attracted to</font>

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,029
NAT PT and then we had RFC 49 66 and the

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,079
big debate about whether net PT was

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,340
right or wrong whether it should be

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,739
historical or whether it should be

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,350
continued development but the biggest

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,858
showstopper for me was that for

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,989
applications which don't understand ipv6

22
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:04,019
which won't work without an ipv4 stack

23
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,880
on a host Matt PT won't help you at

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,340
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yet there are some proposals</font>

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,250
to change that but that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite yet</font>

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,619
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT PT realm as many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,869
that PT last hour so I wanted something

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I could do right now and start</font>

30

testing right now and start coming up

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,179
with some results and figure out what I

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">could do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,259
the end-to-end principle particularly

<font color="#E5E5E5">with ipv6 I'm willing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a pact</font>

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,860
with the devil when it comes to using

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,680
ipv4 net as long as I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a backup</font>

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,970
mechanism for having ipv6 end-to-end

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,840
connectivity so if you want and then

39
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,380
connectivity use ipv6 so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here</font>

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,299
is a relatively simple design just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,250
the proof of concept where we have I

42
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,399
wanted to keep the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat by the way as far</font>

43
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,200
away from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> n2 NV 64 portion I want to</font>

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,540
keep all that muck out of the way as

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,250
much as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could so what we have here is</font>

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">a nap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box that is a one hour nap box</font>

you'd like and then each client now is

<font color="#E5E5E5">NAT it's very simple this is all stuff</font>

63
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,839
that we all do and what what it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,250
you point the default route over to the

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,930
net box here a packet goes in the nap

66
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,550
box it gets translated and goes back out

67
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,920
through the router that's for v4 for

68
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,070
view 6 you just go straight through so

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,530
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very simple solution that you</font>

70
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now that will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce your</font>

box having a nap box on every little

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,080
client network is maybe not very

75
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,870
scalable so there are other ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,310
implement that and one possibilities if

77
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,280
you have a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 distribution layer</font>

78
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,740
you can plug<font color="#E5E5E5"> that matte box into that</font>

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,630
layer 2 layer into the layer 2 switches

80
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,330
the aggregations which is that you have

81
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,220
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> tag vlans over them now there's some</font>

82
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,510
obvious security issues with that you

83
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">can have all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of customer traffic</font>

going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one box so you do</font>

85
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,049
have to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> careful with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

86
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,820
you could also put this nap box up in

87
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,650
your core and use some sort of mpls

88
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,049
magic or whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to send</font>

89
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,519
all the RFC 1918 traffic to it and go

90
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead and translate it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in addition</font>

91
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,269

97
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,950
you know somewhat not very easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so</font>

98
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,690
I you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically</font>

also some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these other things in order</font>

106
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,969
to try to reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> that v4 footprint but</font>

107
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,220
still provide good v6 services so i

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,780
won't really read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the advantages the</font>

disadvantages<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this particular with</font>

110
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,929
respect to matt PT is you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

111
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">have dual stack clients I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

112
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,090
that's a big dis

113
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,679
because clients know how to do dual

114
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,210
stack we have a lot of operating systems

115
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,160
have been configured and programmed to

116
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,870
do dual stack for a long time it's well

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,870
supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's well known so that's not</font>

118
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,810
a big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked a little bit about</font>

119
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,970
the issue of scalability in the last

120
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,290
slide but there's also the notion of

121
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,430
capacity planning you've got all your

122
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,800
stuff going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this NAT</font>

123
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,020
infrastructure now most of the talk

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,610
among the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP community is you have to</font>

125
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,130
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this anyway at some point to reduce</font>

126
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,430
the ipv4 address footprint of some of

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:59,340
these larger ISPs so in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of service</font>

128
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,360
providers and universities as well this

129
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to deal with</font>

130
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,030
any way is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> performance of either nap</font>

131
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,680
PT or ipv4 net in combination with ipv6

132
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,450
but you can engineer your way around

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,190
this and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as an</font>

134
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,750
incentive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people to migrate ipv6</font>

135
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,210
just as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't give them too</font>

136
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,430
much incentive to say migrate away from

137
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,500
you but by<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a slightly</font>

138
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,560
degraded ipv4 service that might get

139
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,720
them to move to ipv6 faster and in

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,610
certain particular scenarios where you

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,110
have and it depends on really how likely

142
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,419
you think this scenario is going to be

143
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,270
but in a situation where you have

144
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,460
applications at all support ipv6 but

145
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,810
you've got some networks out there that

146
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,849
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach that solon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

147
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,400
ipv6 then certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT PT is going to</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> your friend in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that situation so that</font>

149
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,250
that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one case where you'd</font>

discussion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have around what are</font>

152
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,849
we going to do and the free pool runs

153
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,310
out particularly in our own networks how

154
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,139
are we going to be able to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

155
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,000
of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers with the address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

156
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,410
that we have given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're still</font>

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,570
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of v4</font>

158
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,360
solution going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for a long time I'd</font>

159
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to add this in because I think it</font>

160
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,919
does a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice job of making sure</font>

161
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we provide end-to-end v6 services</font>

162
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,539
which is sort of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> philosophy I mean v6</font>

163
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,940
is there to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> address space relief</font>

164
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,590
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us but it's also there to provide</font>

165
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,360
end-to-end transparency for our

166
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers so that's why I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like</font>

167
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,289
this Mullen and that PT does that as

168
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,660
well and if that PT can start supporting

169
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:30,539
legacy applications then we'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

170
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,169
good models to use in order to deal with

171
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:36,990
translation if we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is useful</font>

172
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,760
I'm happy to post this to the various

173
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">wiki's that deal with life</font>

174
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,780
v6 like the air and wiki and the in

175
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,929
Randy's wiki that we have and go through

176
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,309
and talk about how I got beyond the

177
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">proof of concept network which by the</font>

178
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,230
way is running it actually is in my

179
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">office and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few other locations where</font>

180
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,240
we have just you know IT staff working

181
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,130
so we know that it's working in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

182
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,190
case but what happens when we roll out

183
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,719
in larger production and what kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

184
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,040
results do we get which of course is

185
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,580
beyond the scope of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lightning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

186
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,370
but I'm certainly happy to contribute to

187
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,740
this as another model another you know

188
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,640
thing that we can do for translation so

189
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:22,830
that's really all I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

190
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:24,450
questions have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question for you are</font>

191
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,469
you willing to try this out at the next

192
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nana for next type ii v six seven um I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

193
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,070
would be I do think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lot more</font>

194
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,210
fun to do to try out NAT PT and to

195
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,590
really see where we got with that

196
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,489
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think a</font>

197
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,669
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us haven't had a lot of</font>

198
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,170
experience with but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

199
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,150
be available for the next now now but

200
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,740
certainly the october one in los angeles

201
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,140
i should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available for so we're</font>

202
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,530
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in playing around with it we</font>

203
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,530
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>
