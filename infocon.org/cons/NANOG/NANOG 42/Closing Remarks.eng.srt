1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,710
okay it's all I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got all right I'm</font>

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,639
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so I will keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,940
fairly short I find the experience of

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">this being a you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a Monday through</font>

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,509
Wednesday nanog and a half day on

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,430
Wednesday and have this many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,800
still in the room a little bit confusing

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,680
I'm sure given the<font color="#CCCCCC"> party's last night</font>

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,160
many of you are confused as well so this

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,590
is good I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over a</font>

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,010
couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this meeting and</font>

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,110
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next meetings so thanks</font>

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,030
to CRT West for hosting this they were

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,030
fantastic hosts great party last night

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,750
great hotel great facility couldn't ask

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,730
for more and also thanks to all the

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,160
break sponsors and all the beer in gear

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,110
sponsors I mean that's honestly you know

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,239
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear lightweight kvetching about the</font>

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,070
cost of nanog very occasionally but the

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,349
reality is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an extraordinarily</font>

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,789
cheap industry conference for you all to

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,799
go to and the reason it's cheap is

24
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,590
because those guys pony up serious dough

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,090
so if you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like buying something</font>

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,369
from one of them because you saw

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,080
something cool at nanog then mention to

28
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,970
them that you saw them at nanog so that

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,979
their marketing people think nanog those

30
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,390
people buy stuff that's wacky and then

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,130
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they sponsor more</font>

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,000
just a thought if you don't feel like

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,530
buy anything from them that's fine too

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,960
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some statistics about the meeting</font>

35
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,460
we're all math junkies and stats junkie

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:36,048
so 575 registered attendees 483 of those

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:41,059
were not dead weight people like me

38
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:44,970
sorry here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the breakdown by category</font>

40
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,479
numbers have been moving into some other

41
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,340
categories of late like content

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,920
providers are up pretty significantly a

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,689
you know network operator that don't

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,159
specify what kind of network operator

45

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,609

51
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly why that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might be a lot of</font>

represented as well these shift

57
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,579
depending on which coast you're on quite

58
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,109
frequently so one would expect that New

59
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,340
York might get quite a few more

60
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,950
Europeans shorter flights easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco</font>

survey please fill out the survey I know

75
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,820
it's a pain in your toughest is but the

76
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,800
reality is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we do need the feedback</font>

77
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,000
was this a good program what was bad

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,320
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to see in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> future</font>

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,810
and a note on the future so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm 43</font>

80
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,340
is coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Brooklyn in June a</font>

81
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,959
couple notes about that telex is

82
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,400
sponsoring it and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very excited</font>

83
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be sponsoring it and they're doing a</font>

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
lot of promotion work now and a lot of

85
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,560
groundwork now and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,560
fantastic nanog and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nanog in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">york city and that historically hasn't</font>

88
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,780
happened and is a fairly impressive

89
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,880
logistical feat just given how expensive

90
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,970
hotels are in New York and how cheap we

91
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,590
are as a group<font color="#E5E5E5"> so not to say we're cheap</font>

92
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,940
but we're cheap right so like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

93
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,530
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay four hundred dollars a</font>

94
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,930
night for hotels for conferences and to

95
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,310
be able to organize an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ana in New York</font>

96
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,930
with hotel rates under two hundred

97
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,130
dollars I think they actually hit or

98
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,470
just around two hundred dollars is

99
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,540
pretty impressive<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's not an</font>

100
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:03,020
opportunity that's likely to be repeated

101
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:06,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">again in the future so a note about that</font>

102
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the program committee we have</font>

103
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">received an enormous amount of positive</font>

104
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,970
feedback that we got the program out

105
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,859
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough for many of you to make</font>

106
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,780
travel decisions based on the quality

107
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">and content of those presentations</font>

108
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,738
that's great what that means is that

109
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,298
will do that again what that means is

110
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,070
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show a call for</font>
