00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,619

is this Iceland surrounded by water

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,350
obviously there's a low cap cable

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,880
there's a hicap cable there's a history

33
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,039
of backhoe aggression on the high cap

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,320
cable backhaul elements the high cap

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,250
cable terminates in done it bang and

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,829
rationally backhauls down to London the

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,020
low-k below cab cable is going to end

<font color="#CCCCCC">the life soon cable lifetime is roughly</font>

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,550
we use a branching unit we drop a piece

you know you've got distance limitations

74
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,070
you and you have expectations based on

86
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,920
parameters of the project were to look

you look at the electronics<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

91
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,270
the cable types there's multiple cable

92
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,739
types depending upon the depths and in

93
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,350
the geography and the geology of the

94
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,730
bottoms you look at the dry plant what

95
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,130
electronic components are going to be in

96
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,890
the landing stations it's fairly

97
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,780
proprietary by vendor so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

98
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tyco you're going to see obviously</font>

100
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,070

103
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,489

104
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,120
many how many pairs of fiber are going

105
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:12,010
to be in a cable you can you can drop a

106
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,900
cable with two pair of fiber four or

107
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,539
eight the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest cable that I'm that</font>

108
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,950
I'm aware of as an eight pair cable it

109
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,440
was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> something bigger I just</font>

111
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,280
to determine the routing you have to

112
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,500
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where it's going to go under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sea</font>

113
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,200
and how you're going to back all

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,090
to get it to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and</font>

115
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,380
then finally you need to determine what

116
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,609
sort of what your service day is going

117

125
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,169
and the likely the better likelihood

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,200
that you'll be adaptable for a future

127
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:04,200

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,880
to commit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay five minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

we serve in the Middle East that's

really not possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> because all the</font>

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,309
and that's a pretty tight place to be

139

their fisheries are and you negotiate a

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,740
settlement so that you place the cable

149
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,229
in places that they don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fish</font>

probably greater than fifty percent of

the cause of outages what anchors do you

153
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,120
know these submarine cables are hard

ship over one and drop an anchor on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

156
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,930
and go whoops you when a ship drops an

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,760
anchor they<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop the anchor they lay out</font>

158
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,580
some chain to add some weight to hold

159
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,870
the ship in place and then if the

<font color="#E5E5E5">captain of that ship doesn't do the</font>

right thing the ship starts dragging the

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,450
anchor catches on to the cable the cable

163
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,880
snaps under its own weight it's fairly

164
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:27,659
straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's basically the idiot</font>

factor and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally permitting to</font>

cross all these international boundaries

and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need you need to apply</font>

some cases you need to pay taxes so the

170
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,540
chronology of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project we signed an</font>

171
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,940
intent to

172
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,250
seed that basically gets the cable

173
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,800
operator in gets the engineering moving

174
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,990
gets the materials acquisition going

175
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,330
they commissioned the desktop study the

176
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,340
desktop study is the analysis of the

177
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,020
route that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you're</font>

179
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,109

181
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,680
then you sign your final agreement once

182
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,380
you sign your final agreement you make a

183
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,420
fairly large down payment and the

184
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">project begins you finish your back call</font>

185
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,500
selection you do your ocean survey and

186
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,210
basically they<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a ship out and they</font>

187
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,950
map the topography of the route and they

188
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,510
do that from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the a through all the way</font>

189
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:23,219
through to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Z end and then do an</font>

190
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:25,349
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so they manufacture the</font>

191
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,560
cable cables manufactured in links and

192
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,300
they typically will join them and the

193
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,160
joint technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the sweet</font>

194

really is just a wet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metro e on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

196
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,000
long one and it really is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple so</font>

197
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,500
you finish your pops you you contract

204
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,190
service so at the end of the project we

205
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,470
got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise another cable well great</font>

206
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you you know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add this into your</font>

207
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:09,000
system the more cables the merrier so we

208
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,400
started out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out with</font>

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,220
this and when all was said and done in

210
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,679
the time frame of about a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ended</font>

211
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,140
up with this so now we've got three

212
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,480
routes out of the country to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi cap came</font>

to hike one<font color="#E5E5E5"> high cap cable existing one</font>

214

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,640
cable to be installed as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so</font>

216
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,530
interesting stuff there's about forty

ships that do lay repair or both and

225
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,580
typically the vendors will share their

226
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,439
ships so if Tycho has a ship in the

227

area in its<font color="#E5E5E5"> on station laying a cable</font>

228
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,490
and there's a cut somewhere and then

229
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">global marine has a ship that's closer</font>

230
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,440
an idol they'll contract global marine

231
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,390
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that cable because</font>

232
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,120
of the jointing technology they can do

233
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,130
that so in the event of an oddity to the

234

golden marine ship working on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tycho</font>

cut the cable pull up the ends splice

239

them together throw it back down and

complete the repair cables<font color="#E5E5E5"> our pilot</font>

243
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,690
cable costs are coming down quickly more

capacity on the cable below across per

245
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,920
mile as you utilize it tough to reverse

246
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,550
the unit cost but generally the more

247
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,180
denser the cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so interesting</font>

folks and said you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like all</font>

251
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,510
your transport probably crosses he

252
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,580
crosses other transport multiple times

253
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,290
and they said oh no there's just no way

254
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,000
that that happens well here's a map of

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,210
these cable cuts are that people are

265
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,640
cutting costs by doing things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

266
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,080
burying the cable and shallow depths and

267
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,240
not using the proper harm ring because

268
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,800
you can tell the vendor not to armor

269
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,890
things in the wrong places and they will

270

do it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will pay prix fixe mapping</font>

me to give this talk fishing conflicts

288
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,770
analysis when we meet with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fishermen</font>

289
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,540
they gave us GPS coordinates of all of

290
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,990
their their drags over a six-month

291
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,899
period

292
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,240
and so cable was routed to the south of

293
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,529
the fishery that made us happy and not

294
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,899
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> them happy because we didn't</font>

295
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,029
disrupt their fishing here's another

<font color="#CCCCCC">example of routing this is the leg that</font>

297
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,700
goes into the Faroe Islands you'll

298
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,720
notice these numbers here<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

299
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:26,089
depths 2138 meters all nautical charts

300
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,740
are in meters pretty deep but fishing

301
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,149
that's not going to catch this and you

302
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,330
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to heavily armored it so you</font>

00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:33,950
can save a little money here this is a

the wall of that that that route

309
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,910
collapses it's going to break the cable

310
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,830
also if there's a high amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of current</font>

station approach it's very shallow you

320
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,120
would bury your cable all the way and
