00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,300
here than I did but let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through it</font>

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,439
okay we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing some simple</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis for some of our customers this</font>

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,570
is a glimpse at some of the key findings

9
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,680
we're gonna have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the slides</font>

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,390
later but basically what we did was for

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,760
publication purposes we made up a

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,399
topology our marketing department has

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:47,039
had this network topology for quite some

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:49,620
time mapped core nodes and core links on

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that topology when we gave the talk</font>

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,570
at Stanford it was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP where</font>

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,328
audience we spent a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time on that</font>

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:02,460
this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> very familiar if you</font>

19
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,860
have in this case there's sixty six

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:13,040
cities that we modeled and 18 of them

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,070
work or you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small city to city</font>

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,810
traffic flows and you obviously

23
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,298
aggregate them into very large core

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,549
traffic flows for people in transport

25
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,630
that's sort of a revelation but this is

26
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:31,380
a very IP aware group so that's

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,060
networking 101<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now we get to the</font>

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,070
interesting part we actually spent a

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,900
real lot of time on staffer on that this

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,789
is why I can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> an what was an hour</font>

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:54,600
little little step backwards on a

34

methodology we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically took a demand</font>

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,559
which was comparable to the smaller ISPs

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,700
put it on the left<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this graph</font>

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,800
two tick marks into the graph and then

39
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,970
we scaled out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> demands to take a look</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font>

41
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:19,020
how cost per bit is impacted going into

42
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,060
the future if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left side</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> graph where we have a low scale</font>

44
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,500
what you'd have is if you built your

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,989
whole network out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of OC 768 you have a</font>

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,900
lot of under filled interfaces so you'd

47
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:34,290
have a dramatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop in cost per bit as</font>

48
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,180
you began to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,600
true with the transport into with the

50
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,720
transport costs you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have fiber which is</font>

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,820
carrying very little traffic and as you

52
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,890
fill that capacity you don't add it you

53
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,310
you add very little cost as you go and

54
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,989
eventually flattens out if you were to

55
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,800
do the same thing with 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gigabit</font>

56
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet obviously you have less wasted</font>

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,930
bandwidth it at the low scale and this

58
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,650
is all very obvious to many people here

59
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,480
that 10 gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost less than than 768 so</font>

60
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,250
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the scale you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have seven</font>

61
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,480
hundred dollars per megabit if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,040
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale here you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got four</font>

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,679
hundred and fifty dollars per megabit at

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,679
the very far left end and in both cases

65
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,400
they level out another way of building

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,430
the network and this is this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,489
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly obvious to most people at</font>

68
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,900
going so far anyway is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

69
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">build it with layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 layer 3 switches</font>

70
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,090
with some loss of functionality don't

71
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,489
let anybody from for standard foundry

72
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,930
here we say that but with some loss of

73
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:48,930
functionality the generally those boxes

74
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:51,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">are smaller in capacity than your your</font>

75
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,220
core routers and so you end up having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

76
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:59,250
quickly build a class which is a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

77
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,609
like an array of routers in order to

78
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle the capacity you very quickly get</font>

79
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,930
beyond one however the router cost goes

80
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:14,070
way down so in this case your transport

81
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,680
costs dominate in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other cases the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">router costs dominate here the red line</font>

83
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,280
is a router<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost in the green line is</font>

84
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,450
the transport costs again with the OC

85
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,450
768 it's more dramatic

86
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,330
another technique<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been looking at</font>

87
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,909
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually unit did way</font>

88
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,310
back a decade more than a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decade ago and</font>

89
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">they called it IP router bypass i'm not</font>

90
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,979
sure what anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to call it</font>

91
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,109
but essentially if you have enough

92
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:45,758
traffic for example if you have parallel

93
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:50,860
10 gigabit eat interfaces between a

94
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:55,860
chain of cities example is Detroit

95
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:58,979
Chicago Denver pick your cities if you

96
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,810
put up a few create a link between

97
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:04,270
Detroit and Denver<font color="#E5E5E5"> bypassing Chicago</font>

98
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,460
even though the fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes past that</font>

99
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,318
core node you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually reduce the</font>

100
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,680
number of router interfaces and you can

101
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,659
save some<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs it doesn't incur any</font>

102
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:19,750
additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost in transport so it's</font>

103
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:22,030
it's a net cost savings the goal is of

104
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">course to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the number of router</font>

105
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:28,380
interfaces there's a practical limit

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,789
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know you could do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

107
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,009
mathematical exercise but in practice

108
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:37,419
you can't do as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP router bat</font>

109
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:40,169
bypass as as the as an analysis like

110
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:45,039
this would predict the practical

111
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:47,650
limitation is imposed on by how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

112
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">your traffic patterns actually change in</font>

113
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,840
real life and that is measurable but so

114
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:57,039
far we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any measurements of it</font>

115
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,340
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't quantify it today at the</font>

116
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,620
current scales only a small number of

117
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:07,739
bypass links are<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-effective and due</font>

118
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> high variability in the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flow</font>

119
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,400
that providers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've talked to</font>

120
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">hotel is that that very few are</font>

121
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,008
practical they so those who are doing

122
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,289
using this technique only<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have</font>

123
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,659
anywhere from just one or two to maybe

124
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:26,349
four or five bypass links in their

125
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:30,039
entire network the potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

126
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:34,240
savings are very substantial though

127
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:36,430
again preface by saying that the number

128
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,750
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bypass lengths that you can in</font>

129
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:44,440
practice put in place is limited by how

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,240
much your traffic patterns change if you

131
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the graph this particular graph</font>

132
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows relative to doing no IP bypass</font>

133
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,969
what your cost savings would be and this

134
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,190
is total<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost so its transport plus the</font>

135
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,280
router<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and as you can see you've</font>

136
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">got more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than a twenty five percent gain</font>

137
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,890
if you were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually put that</font>

138
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,560
many bypass links in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

139
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,500

140
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,650
links and so this really is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing</font>

141
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,320
the next plot just truncate sat 30 and

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,150
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just shows that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do gained</font>

143
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:24,510
substantial amount by just putting in

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:28,090
five or ten bypass links if you were to

145
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:32,980
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the maximum number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bypass</font>

146
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:35,380
links you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even at at the</font>

147
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:39,310
highest scale we have here which is a 32

148
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,280
terabit coming into an IP network which

149
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:49,000
for most providers we think is at least

150
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:53,859
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future your savings</font>

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,730
aren't are not tremendous but you can

152
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,650
potentially get a twenty percent savings

153
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,480
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even then you're not building a full</font>

154
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,880
mesh this is sort of a revelation for

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,620
transport people again especially those

156
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,760
people who believe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OL optical</font>

157
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,430
network they believed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could</font>

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,770
build just build a full mesh and it just

159
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,860
doesn't it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not cost-effective even if</font>

160
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:19,120
the transport was free that a full mesh

161
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,760
would not be cost-effective if you were

162
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,410
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a lot of IP bypass one of</font>

163
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we've noticed is your optical</font>

164
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:29,020
reach goes way up so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

165
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:34,289
did create a bypass link from Chicago to

166
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:36,699
Salt<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lake City you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a long way to go</font>

167
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,839
this has some impact if you're

168
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,180
considering

169
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,160
doing optical switching because now you

170
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,010
have to figure in the regen cost you

171
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,579
also have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out that every</font>

optical<font color="#E5E5E5"> add drop that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you pass through</font>

173
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:55,900
provides a penalty it reduces your reach

174
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:59,770
somewhat the most how am i doing time

175
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:03,430
anyway I'm gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> do okay the the the</font>

176
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:06,670
longest reached<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody claims is 2000</font>

177
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:11,739
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2500 but we show that even that's too</font>

178
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:16,329
low let's I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to skip down</font>

179
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:18,130
and I live a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute so okay some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

180
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:24,250
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we're doing that I</font>

181
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:26,680
didn't show in this presentation is the

182
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">impact of mpls te we haven't actually</font>

183
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,280
done that there's some stuff that we did

184
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stanford the couple slides on</font>

185
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,750
restoration techniques it turns out that

186
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,400
I GP restoration today is much cheaper

187
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,800
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport restoration which is</font>

188
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,520
another revelation for transport people

189
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,050
not such a revelation for IP people it's

190
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">very easy to do the same sort of</font>

191
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:51,990
analysis for space and for space and

192
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:54,699
power I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> done some analysis with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

193
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,900
DWDM in<font color="#E5E5E5"> alien waves I was hoping to be</font>

194
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,780
able to show it today that would have

195
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,680
been much more interesting than this and

196
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,319
there's some stuff with future

197
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,810
technology that is in the research world

198
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,910
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> planning to do we haven't</font>

199
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:10,989
been quite yet really that the only the

200
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">only thing you get out of this is that</font>

201
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">768 is a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more expensive even in the</font>

202
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:20,050
foreseeable future then it's more

203
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,880
expensive than either even OC 192 any

204
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,859
pause is much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive than 10</font>

205
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,840
gige there are some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh we've</font>

206
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,210
known that forever there are other there

207
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,150
particularly the carriers are pushing

208
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,710
for 760 anyway the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 layer 3</font>

209
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,900
switches are much cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> than routers</font>

210
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,360
everybody knows that there's some there

211
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,770
are some limitations to them though and

212
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,290
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the IP router</font>

213
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,520
bypass can substantially reduce costs

214
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,900
and one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're looking</font>

215
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,010
for

216
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,160
and we're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of trouble</font>

217
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:51,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting is the data that would be</font>

218
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,329
necessary to quantify the limits to how

219
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:59,470
much bypass is practical and that's

220
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:06,420
pretty much it<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks have any quick</font>

221
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:06,420
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you curse</font>
