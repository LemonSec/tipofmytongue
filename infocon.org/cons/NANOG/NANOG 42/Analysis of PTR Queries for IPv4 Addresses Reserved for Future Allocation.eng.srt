1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:15,299
so we will start with Leo<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vigoda and</font>

2
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,850
he's right now working at ini used to

3
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,670
work at ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCC and he will talk about</font>

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the analysis of PRT queries for ipv4</font>

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:31,130
addresses in reserved for future

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:34,410
allocation Leo please<font color="#E5E5E5"> hello um so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um I</font>

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:38,430
concentrate in my work on looking at IP

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,860
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I came here to the last</font>

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,079
nanog made a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightning talk in</font>

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,690
which I said hey we've got lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">people telling us that these unallocated</font>

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,300
addresses are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and that's a bad</font>

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,730
thing and reported it to you and went

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,989
away thinking I just told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you there was</font>

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,730
a problem but I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really give you</font>

16
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much data i just gave you some</font>

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,190
anecdotes and pointed her to like a

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,979
couple of websites and that isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,509
useful so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away did a little bit</font>

20
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:13,729
more thinking and came up with a method

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:18,780
hopefully of how to measure unallocated

22
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:23,759
ipv4 addresses that are in use it's not

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,270
all the addresses but it's a view so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

24
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,189
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about what the problem is</font>

25
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,720
what we're going to try and measure what

26
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:35,100
we can't measure what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results are</font>

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:39,420
and then talk a little bit about going

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward so the problem again to recap is</font>

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:48,210
all an allocated unicast address space

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,570
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> allocated there won't be any / 8</font>

31
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,820
left in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ionath free pool that remain</font>

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,699
free at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we've all</font>

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,990
switched to ipv6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've taken the</font>

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,090
ipv4 off our networks unfortunately the

35
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,570
move to ipv6 isn't going to be that fast

36
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need all this ipv4</font>

37
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,099
address space the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some</font>

38
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,510
networks are already using this address

39
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,640
space and that means that

40
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,670
there are potential addressing conflicts

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,369
when you've got multiple networks using

42
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,048
the same addresses and all sorts of

43
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:29,530
thinking that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using them</font>

44
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:32,379
so that's that's the problem and we have

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:37,230
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure it basically by looking</font>

46
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:40,268
at DNS queries received at l root for

47
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,060
the addresses that are in these

48
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:46,900
unallocated blocks the root nameservers

49
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,140
provide the dns service for<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy DARPA</font>

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,629
if a / 8 is not allocated it's not

51
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,819
delegated therefore the queries are

52
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:56,170
going to come to the route we run l

53
00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:00,298
routes so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go and do some</font>

54
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:03,548
measurements and so we can hopefully

55
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:06,159
infer from this a little bit about which

56
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:10,799
which parts of this unallocated address

57
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:14,980
space are in use and maybe even how much

58
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:17,290
what we can't measure is the people who

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:22,828
have reasonably well maintained networks

60
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-run networks but those networks</font>

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,819
don't link we're measuring people who

62
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:30,340
leaked people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

63
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:36,399
split-horizon dns people who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,780
egress filters people who sort of want

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,060
to run a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> network but aren't</font>

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,459
doing it very well and that's what we're

67
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,889
seeing that's what we can measure we

68
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,359
can't really legally measure anyone

69
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:48,129
who's running a private network and

70
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:52,480
using this address space and doing it so

71
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:54,608
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't see them it's that</font>

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,879
that's what we can't see I don't know

73
00:03:54,609 --> 00:04:00,060
how big that slice of pie is it could be

74
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,530
really big and it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite small</font>

75
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,139
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there is a way to</font>

76
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,790
measure if there is a way then please

77
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:10,900
let me know because I would be very

78
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as well these are the</font>

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,298
initial results just taken from one day

80
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:18,639
of oh to be honest looking at the big

81
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:22,120
picture it doesn't really change all

82
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,750
that much this is all the queries we got

83
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,889
four in a dropper and as you can see on

84
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,319
the

85
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,449
left hand side there's a a long blue

86
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:35,590
line which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is considerably longer than</font>

87
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:38,050
all the other blue lines and that's an

88
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,469
outlier of lots and lots and lots of

89
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,279
queries and then it sort of curves down

90
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:46,659
quite steeply and then shallows off and

91
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,289
write down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the right-hand side you</font>

92
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:52,360
can see there's some odd-looking names

93
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,120
if you look down on the x-axis and

94
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,919
there's sort of rubbish names in in a

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,949
droid r / that for some reason people

96
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,770
send queries to us for not entirely sure

97
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:04,539
why but we do know that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roots get</font>

98
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,688
all sorts of rubbish thrown at them so

99
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:09,639
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> too exceptional but this is</font>

100
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:11,590
this is what the the big picture looks

101
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:16,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">like when you look at the distribution</font>

102
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:18,938
for all / aids and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most exciting</font>

103
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:22,810
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is the stuff on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

104
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:24,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand side so if we take a closer look at</font>

105
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,789
the stuff on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side we can</font>

106
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:30,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually start to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what's up</font>

107
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:34,330
there at the top and is there anything

108
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:37,779
that's problematic and first off we've

109
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:42,568
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to 22 / 8 which is allocated to AP</font>

110
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:45,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nick and I don't know why it gets such a</font>

111
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:50,080
lot more queries than the other / aids

112
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:52,509
it is odd it was suggested to me that it

113
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,339
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be legitimate dns lookups</font>

114
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,169
performed by mail servers because

115
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:59,680
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of mail what comes out of</font>

116
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">22 2 / 8 I don't know if that's the case</font>

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,149
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually run a mail server so</font>

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,710
it's not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell it</font>

119
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:07,779
could just be one machine that's going

120
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,938
crazy and sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a hell of a lot of</font>

121
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">queries we haven't actually gone done</font>

122
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:15,789
that investigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we could chuck</font>

123
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,330
this away and normalize the data and you

124
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:23,080
would see a slightly different curve 10

125
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:27,609
/ 8 that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not particularly weird we</font>

126
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,529
expect people to leak 10 / 8 i'm sure it

127
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,099
happens quite a lot and it's right up

128
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:36,519
there near<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top 0 / 8 which is this</font>

129
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:39,759
network and also it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too weird</font>

130
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,630
that's leaked and then we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got 2 / 8</font>

131
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
which is

132
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,219
unallocated it's quite near the top I

133
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,230
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 16th from the top</font>

134
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:53,320
and obviously you've got 10 and 0 in

135
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,630
there which can't really be used anyway

136
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,969
so you could sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to closer</font>

137
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,350
to the top it's starting to look a

138
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,170
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit odd that we've got</font>

139
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:06,700
unallocated address space which is so

140
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:13,240
close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top in this in this view at</font>

141
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:16,960
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> on L so this now we need to go and</font>

142
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,670
look at more data more days and take out

143
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,099
all the allocated stuff anyway because

144
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,130
the allocated stuff we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font>

145
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,730
about so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the curve that we get</font>

146
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,860
and even though I've taken out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

147
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:33,390
allocated stuff you still can't see the

148
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:37,600
names because there's too many entries

149
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:40,539
so I created a top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 just to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

150
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,470
easy to read and you can see that too is

151
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,090
there at the top and then one and five

152
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:50,190
which I spoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when I was here last</font>

153
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:53,590
time which is that hamachi VPN service

154
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:56,500
100 is there at number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and that's</font>

155
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,989
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed that we</font>

156
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,960
allocated to slash eights Erin last week

157
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,390
and the next / eights that we were going

158
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give them we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to give them</font>

159
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:10,479
100 and 101 but because we saw 100 on

160
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,040
this list and it was so near the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top we</font>

161
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,640
thought that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

162
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,710
choice for Erin well actually for an RA

163
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,990
are right now until we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a better</font>

164
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,659
view of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem because it's</font>

165
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:26,140
possible that we go and allocate those /

166
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,790
eights to Aaron and then Aaron gets lots

167
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,229
of calls saying hey we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

168
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,540
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this address space and</font>

169
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron's customers the operators in this</font>

170
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:38,800
region have lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems using that</font>

171
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:43,709
address space so that was that was why

172
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:49,510
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't use 100 in well this round and</font>

173
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:52,600
but we've we've got a view now the top

174
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,620
10 / 30 day period which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 30 days</font>

175
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,850
ending on sun

176
00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">a-and I went and had a look at this</font>

177
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">because when I went and pulled these</font>

178
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,900
statistics on sunday i also went and

179
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,830
looked at them and compared them against

180
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,740
the statistics I used when I presented

181
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:15,130
this work at the es nog meeting in

182
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,170
Madrid a couple of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and it</font>

183
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,210
turns out that the data aren't really

184
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,969
all that static the order of domains in

185
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:26,380
the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten changes and domains join and</font>

186
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,900
leave the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten so what we've got here</font>

187
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,750
is we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> side-by-side comparison of</font>

188
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,449
these two periods<font color="#CCCCCC"> 28th of december to 26</font>

189
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,290
of january and 19th of january to 17th

190
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,260
of februari to 30 day periods and there

191
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:45,730
is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of an overlap and what</font>

192
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,230
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see is two and one they stay at</font>

193
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,279
the top and they stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the right order</font>

194
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:55,570
but we've got we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / h that</font>

195
00:09:51,279 --> 00:10:00,939
rise and some / eights that go down 5

196
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:03,490
and 23 rise 127 drop and we've got four

197
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,050
new entries and it looks just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

198
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,339
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 used to listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the radio</font>

199
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:12,270
before radio became rubbish so we've

200
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:16,470
we've got all that movement in there and

201
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:19,390
what this shows me or what what I am

202
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,520
inferring<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this data is that it's</font>

203
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:25,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">not static there is the movement here</font>

204
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:28,870
and at this time I don't really know why

205
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,729
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> do know that we want to do a</font>

206
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more work on this we want to</font>

207
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,760
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what's going on so what we're</font>

208
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,800
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> measuring at the moment is we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

209
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,630
measuring the query source address and

210
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s number that we could get from</font>

211
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it would be a possibility that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

212
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">could go and collect this data it's not</font>

213
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,250
difficult to collect and then we could

214
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,439
go and say ah you're querying for this

215
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,870
unallocated address that probably means

216
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone in your AS IS using that</font>

217
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,670
address maybe we could go and inform the

218
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,380
people operating that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s that they've</font>

219
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,160
got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on it could be causing</font>

220
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,120
them a problem but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that we</font>

221
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,069
want to

222
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,520
actually go and do a little bit more

223
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:16,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">work so far we've only been measuring</font>

224
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:20,020
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> l root I've spoken to other</font>

225
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,790
operators and they are in theory happy

226
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,930
to share the data with us so that we can

227
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:28,180
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better view of this situation it</font>

228
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,550
turns out that i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really a proper</font>

229
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,650
researcher I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just someone who noticed</font>

230
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,900
a problem and wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look but</font>

231
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,060
to do proper research you need a set of

232
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,130
skills that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have and I can</font>

233
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:43,959
doesn't really it's not really set up to

234
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:45,939
do so what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to be able to</font>

235
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,650
do is merge in data from other root

236
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,060
server operators who've got nodes in all

237
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,430
sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries around the</font>

238
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,479
world in different cities at different

239
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,359
internet exchanges and we would then get

240
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,860
extra data we would get data about

241
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,820
whether the query was received on a

242
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:10,180
global or a local mode which city it was

243
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,459
in who peers with that a s all those

244
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,859
sorts of data and someone who really

245
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:16,270
knows how to crunch the numbers could

246
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,010
then actually do some really useful

247
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:24,579
analysis it's a big job<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we want</font>

248
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do now is we want to look at whether</font>

249
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,540
we are going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get some skills</font>

250
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,029
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in-house are we going to farm</font>

251
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:35,140
it out but this is clearly some work

252
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:38,620
that we're going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

253
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:41,770
bit more research on so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

254
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,630
combine the data from l and<font color="#E5E5E5"> k and all</font>

255
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,000
the other root server operators that are

256
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to share the data with us and get a</font>

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,430
better set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

258
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:57,670
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> present and then hopefully use this</font>

259
00:12:51,430 --> 00:13:01,989
data to at least pre-war people possibly

260
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:04,860
help get some stuff fixed that's ideally

261
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:08,140
what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do with this and</font>

262
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,170
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end if anyone's got any</font>

263
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,350
questions then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll do my best to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

264
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,349
them

good morning hi Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> Louis Lee</font>

266
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:34,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Equinix thank you luili equinix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

267
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find out if you've looked to see if</font>

268
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:44,140
any or both or all these in a top 10 are

269
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:47,569
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> global routing table no I haven't</font>

270
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,850
I probably should but I was I was just

271
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,510
looking at reverse dns queries at the

272
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:57,440
moment but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I</font>

273
00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:00,230
should do I suppose yeah but that would

274
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,110
be what proper research you would do Leo

275
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">bicknell is see I'm wondering if you</font>

276
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,960
looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source of these queries to</font>

277
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,820
see if you know perhaps all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the queries</font>

278
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,650
for a particular / 8 we're coming from

279
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,279
one or two resolvers which might

280
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:18,650
indicate who was using them internally

281
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,900
no I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to</font>

282
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">gather all that kind of data well i say</font>

283
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,529
i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to i want to get someone else to</font>

284
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,670
do it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't really think</font>

285
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,939
it's something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would do very well</font>

286
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:32,390
but yes I i think that is exactly the

287
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would make this run</font>

288
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,360
just sort of isn't this an interesting

289
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,670
problem too how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> help and yeah it</font>

290
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,370
would be good if we could go and do that

291
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:46,099
and help one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the issues I've</font>

292
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,339
discussed with John Crane who is

293
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,410
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for help is there are some</font>

294
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:55,130
privacy considerations handling all that

295
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:57,110
data sort of taking the query address

296
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:01,070
and then turning it into contact

297
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,510
information for someone so before we go

298
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,459
and do that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it through</font>

299
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:07,910
very carefully and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

300
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:10,339
other route operators would also want to

301
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,829
think through very carefully and maybe

302
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:15,080
get us to sign stuff before they went

303
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:19,430
and shared that data with us it's the

304
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,950
sort of thing that if if we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it well</font>

305
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:26,199
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it would be good but we don't</font>

306
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,200
want to leak private data<font color="#CCCCCC"> too too much</font>

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Keith Mitchell IRC yes it's interesting</font>

work thanks leo just to point out that

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a lot of the infrastructure for</font>

operators including yourselves as

314

317
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:08,110
share this data properly and go and do

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> research well when we get someone</font>

319
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:17,920
better than me to go and do the research

320
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:21,520
but yes I totally agree hi Helen Larson

321
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">from agente de have you considered</font>

322
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,980
further instrumenting to attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

323
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,469
determine the level of noise queries on

324
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,770
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be considered allocated or</font>

325
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:35,710
legitimate address space to determine

326
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,020
server baseline noise floor below which

327
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:43,510
you probably shouldn't pay any attention

328
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:45,430
to these I've not given it a thought it

329
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:50,470
sounds like a very sensible thing to do

330
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:55,229
but this is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much raw data this</font>

331
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:58,230
this doesn't have any any data cleaning

332
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,230
thanks

333
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:06,178
I join<font color="#CCCCCC"> rustles from the measurement</font>

334
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:11,130
factory one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think to keep</font>

335
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:12,540
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind is things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that make DNS queries</font>

336
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,699
sort of have different behavior when

337
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,668
they when when something this exists and

338
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,720
what it doesn't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so in some</font>

339
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,970
sense looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the root is the wrong</font>

340
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,370
place to look but in the other since

341
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,140
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only place to look because for</font>

342
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:27,958
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know some of these zones</font>

343
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,690
like zero net or DARPA don't exist

344
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,770
anywhere right so it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worthwhile</font>

345
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:39,570
to at least temporarily make those exist

346
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:41,850
and collect data on on those servers in

347
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:46,110
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that to the roots so</font>

348
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:51,540
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> start serving empty zones for</font>

349
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:54,059
ya<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and let's go hadn't thought</font>

350
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:57,690
about that sounds like an interesting

351
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:01,340
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's the sort of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

352
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,870
real researchers think of and I didn't

353
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,490
I've got one Detroit<font color="#CCCCCC"> jessup from the</font>

354
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,719
Utah Education Network I'm just

355
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering whether you've considered the</font>

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,340
possibility that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and the two and</font>

357
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,559
the 100 networks the reason why you're

358
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,909
seeing such large amounts of queries

359
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,799
against those are because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

360
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,500
miscreant or the malware that's out

361
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,720
there thats starts at one dot one dot

362
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,100
one dot one and goes through the

363
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,429
internet and actually just<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the</font>

364
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,889
reverse queries on those IP addresses

365
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,090
100 is also one that we see is a great

366
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,980
starting point for the miscreant

367
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,928
community when they're creating their

368
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:40,020
scan blocks so just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement when I</font>

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:42,210
go and look through our abuse mailbox we

do seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a disco shin Utley high</font>

371
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:49,230
number of complaints about 100 and I

372
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:52,290
also noticed that when i use some of

373
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">these Wi-Fi hotspots where you have to</font>

00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:10,830
a reverse dns query and sending and

379
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:17,789
be that it's just that one dot 1 / 16

which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really dodgy / 16 within that</font>

away somewhere I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking at</font>

the data with the DSC<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS statistics</font>

collector stuff I yeah I think that is

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,740
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

391
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,020
research to go and look at where there

00:19:54,929 --> 00:20:04,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">are hot spots go and clean up the data a</font>

393
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:06,090
bit go and see if the if the little

394
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:10,460
movements that we saw between the two

395
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:13,370
measurements that I took are really

396
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,510
significant all that sort of thing so

397
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,549
hopefully this was a little bit more

398
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:22,710
useful than just saying hey there's a

399
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:24,600
problem and maybe the next nanog will

400
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,480
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something even more useful than</font>

401
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,408
saying now we've now we've got some

402
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,650
measurements so hopefully this has been

403
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,650
fairly useful

404
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:44,560
any more questions thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very muchly</font>
