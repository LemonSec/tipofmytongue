1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:11,219
thank you good morning and al and john

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,920
from comcast like to talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,259
about dhcpv6 and so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i call the</font>

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">state of the union so when i joined</font>

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,660
comcast but four years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we looked at</font>

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,410
the heb v6 and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in a bad</font>

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,390
shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RFC was out but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there was not</font>

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,949
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a usable implementation there was</font>

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,299
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> product that we could buy</font>

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,760
and it was a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:38,218
live in bradford dhcp so moving on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> d2</font>

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,079
ipv6 dhcpv6 was going to be something

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,200
important to us so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been working</font>

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a number of players and getting</font>

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,030
some product of the ground and we have

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tests so last year we</font>

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,430
did the first back off just before the

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:58,230
ITF in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prague and MIDI the second one</font>

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,670
before the ITF in Vancouver so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,959
picture from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back of inner in</font>

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:07,260
Vancouver so last time around we had

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,320
eight vandals coming and 14 different

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,080
implementations this is done in this

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,820
period you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interop so we do</font>

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,270
not publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> with detail weasel to try to</font>

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,500
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> some general overview so I will not</font>

27
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,939
give the exact names of the

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,619
implementations but if you're interested

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can come and talk to me we have six</font>

30
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,750
different dhcpv6 servers but we have

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,700
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> using five different dhcpv6 clients</font>

32
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,920
and three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different relays so some</font>

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,650
companies have one of each some have

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,960
even multiple servers in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> total of</font>

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,909
fifteen participant you can see the

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,520
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a room with 15 people in it</font>

37
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,619
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very crowded a lot of</font>

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,869
cables and lots of laptops and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:54,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">people for about two and a half days so</font>

40
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,060
quickly some findings when we add the

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">first back off last year before the IHF</font>

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,360
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague we added at the ripe NCC in</font>

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Amsterdam and most things works at the</font>

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,459
time but there were a number of

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,508
clarification that were needed like our

46
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,550
relays were really supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

47
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,260
because essentially this is taking a

48
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,750
DHCP message and tunnel

49
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,689
through the infrastructure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final</font>

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,989
server so all those clarifications have

51
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:25,290
been essentially done now and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

52
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,060
some bags that's expected but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bags</font>

53
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,920
were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really minor bugs and were</font>

54
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,110
like just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like programming error so they</font>

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:37,109
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> em were quickly fixed on site</font>

56
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:38,640
and this stuff is now really ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

57
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,310
production so there might be some later

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,238
caveat left and right but most of it is

59
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,819
now usable we are now both some

60
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,579
commercial and some open source product

61
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,608
but are<font color="#E5E5E5"> available at least two major</font>

62
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:56,579
open source product but past all those

63
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:59,099
tests based on flying colors and that

64
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,290
was really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good we are seeing</font>

65
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,828
some dhcpv6 clients being integrated

66
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,599
with operating systems but this is a

67
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:09,810
toad slow so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are pushing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard</font>

68
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,339
to get all the different OS that you can

69
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,900
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your laptop or things that you</font>

70
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:19,680
can run on home gateway<font color="#CCCCCC"> or any kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:24,870
device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use ipv6 we are getting</font>

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,000
there so well last slide on this one of

73
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,910
the next steps for us so we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,730
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one third dhcpv6 back off in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> March</font>

75
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,129
that will be march seven six and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

76
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,548
in Philadelphia<font color="#E5E5E5"> but will be the week</font>

77
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:41,790
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf so again two and a half days</font>

78
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:44,280
seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work well for us and after that</font>

79
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,280
during the ITF there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font>

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,560
ipv6 our just like here at nano get

81
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">Randy explained earlier on and we will</font>

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,609
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> address assignment for dhcpv6 on the</font>

83
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,619
ipv6 only<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless network so that we</font>

84
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,180
provide much more coverage and much more

85
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,120
people will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to use this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

86
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the goal being that starting ITF 72 and</font>

87
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,979
further dhcpv6 address assignment will

88
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,608
be part of a normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and expected network</font>

89
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:17,549
today they use dhcpv6 only to carry the

90
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:19,970
address of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns server so we would like</font>

91
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have the address assignment on</font>

92
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,110
and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

93
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,430
vendors to get this stuff integrated so

94
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,449
we could all use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our own laptop</font>

95
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,389
but we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I wanted to make</font>

96
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,759
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we have gone a really long way</font>

97
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,330
since the last couple years we now have

98
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:44,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">some code that is fairly solid but is</font>

99
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:50,849
really usable and can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take it</font>

100
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,849
that's it excellent thank you allah

101
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:57,879
looks like we have a question from the

102
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,938
mic yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a quick comment Michael</font>

103
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sinatra from UC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Berkeley um the servers</font>

104
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:04,569
and clients are doing well one thing I

105
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,810
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so pretty spotty is the relay</font>

106
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,550
agents you've got implementations that

107
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,050
have good servers but don't support the

108
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,090
relay agent you've got certain routers

109
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,439
some routers support relay agents in

110
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,090
some don't so it's still kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

111
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,300
scale some of this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

112
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,128
throw that out for real a space is where

113
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,740
we saw the most problem at the first

114
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:25,389
bake off from all the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who came at</font>

115
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,569
the first wake up and came at the second

116
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:32,620
most of us problems have now been fixed

117
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:34,719
but as I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier we had about</font>

118
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,430
eight vandals I do not claim that we

119
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:43,020
sweep isn't all the possible vendors on

120
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:43,020
the planet excellent
