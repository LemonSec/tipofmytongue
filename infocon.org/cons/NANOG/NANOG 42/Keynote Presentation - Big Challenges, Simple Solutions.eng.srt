00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,370
are getting set up every once in while

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program committee gets together and</font>

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,489
tries to think of a good keynote that

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,928
would come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for an analog we don't do</font>

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,099
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every nanog we do it</font>

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,190
opportunistically when we have some

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,180
great speakers interesting topics so the

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,470
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm the guy stuck up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,539
announcing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a guy who had</font>

11
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,070
we've got Tom and Dan to actually come

12
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,750
into this keynote and got amazon to

13
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,119
present which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if anybody has</font>

14
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,009
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> conferences for years amazon</font>

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,960
doesn't present very often so it's kind

16
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,219
of neat to get these guys here but

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
you've got Tom kill a who's a vice

18
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,640
president at amazon of what do you do

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,129
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that helps and Dan Cohen</font>

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,649
who's the principal engineer right it's

21
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,449
all about titles right so anyway these

22
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,430
guys are get this thing all set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,750
have a great presentation on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon</font>

24
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,910
is doing these days big challenges

25
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,140
simple solutions and I think they've

26
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a pretty innovative company and</font>

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,489
been pretty flexible when we got bombed

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,699
and have now grown up again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

29
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:07,128
we'll see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> good stuff guys ready to</font>

30
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:07,128
go pressures on

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,589

you just gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> them do presented Hills</font>

35
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,970
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really presenter tools</font>

44
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,730
familiar with amazon com but in terms of

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,739
what we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is our mission and</font>

46
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,709
what we do what we strive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this has</font>

47
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,480
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> our mission for the last 13 years</font>

48
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,800
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 and a half years is to be the</font>

earth's most customer-centric company

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,670
with respect to customers we think about

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,650
three different things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

52
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,350
consumers or people who you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

53
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,270
stuff from us sellers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> seller on our</font>

54
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,579
marketplace platforms and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

55
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">developers now some of our customers</font>

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">were multiple of these hats hats there</font>

57
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,370
you know people may have overlapping

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,540
roles but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about these three</font>

59
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,640
categories of customers and in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,260
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we serve the consumers and sellers</font>

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">are objective there is to provide a</font>

62
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,079
place where people can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> and discover</font>

63
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,510
anything they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to buy online</font>

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,330
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in all sorts of different</font>

65
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">shapes and sizes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it essentially from</font>

66
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front end looking in looks like a</font>

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,959
bunch of websites and different forms

68
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend gets pretty interesting in</font>

69
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,590
terms of what lies behind that this is

70
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,010
what an eight hundred thousand square

71
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,080
foot building looks like which contrasts

72
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,010
sharply with Randy's apartment and Tokyo

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were talking about it this</font>

74
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">morning this one happens to be out and</font>

75
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,830
divided<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a bunch of these</font>

76
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the world we've got something</font>

77
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,989
like 30 buildings not all this this form

78
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,970
factor but that's what fulfillment looks

79
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,310
like and what makes that box show up on

80
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,410
your doorstep they're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

81
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,799
just wide and deep but they're pretty

82
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,450
high too quite well stacked as you take

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,459
your digital pictures you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to watch</font>

84
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,209
out for crazy guys on forklift trucks

85
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,680
zooming around and this is where the

86
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,560
rubber hits the network really this is a

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,370
sortation device you can see little

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,840
people at the end of so busy is a

89
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,330
conveyor belt that's going at about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 kilometers an hour with tilt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raised</font>

91
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,660
along it and if there's any packet loss

92
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,420
or city different

93
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">see issues then that tilts happens at</font>

94
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,839
the wrong / and potentially the wrong

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,940
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends up in a box with respect to</font>

96
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,070
how we serve software developers what we

97
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,079
try to do we we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that over the last</font>

98
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 12 years or so we built up a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

99
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">of useful infrastructural components</font>

100
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,029
that have allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build the</font>

101
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:23,850
applications that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we build and what we</font>

102
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,500
said was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should figure out a</font>

103
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,020
way to give other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people access to those</font>

104
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,910
so we've exposed a bunch of AP is so

105
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,159
that other people can build web scale

106
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">competing services and free developers</font>

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,670
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build an application</font>

108
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,290
from the heavy lifting typically

109
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated with launching and growing a</font>

110
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,200
successful web business a lot of that

111
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,480
heavy lifting we refer to it internally

112
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,560
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> mock so you know anything that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

113
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,360
the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> logic that you're actually</font>

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,970
trying to expose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside world is</font>

115
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,610
mark so server<font color="#E5E5E5"> is networks cables all</font>

116
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,620
that stuff as<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark and we feel like</font>

117
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,050
developers running startups they'd much

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,870
rather be building their application

119
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,220
than dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this stuff and this is</font>

120
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,220
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a picture of our data</font>

121
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,140
center by the way we're we're slightly

122
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,420
tidier than this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure something</font>

123
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,950
to somebody like keeping their head down

124
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the room right now because maybe it's</font>

125
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,760
there is but but in any case this is the

126
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,770
muck we think about and this is the sort

127
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,960
of image that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to free</font>

128
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,299
developers from so rather than having

129
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">them deal with that we try to allow them</font>

130
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,250
to do with api's you publish very simple

131
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">api's and rest and soap format and at</font>

132
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the month give them a real</font>

133
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,810
nice clean bill that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what's</font>

134
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,280
on the right hand side here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we start</font>

135
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,300
from those developers and work backwards

136
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,580
in terms of part of the right

137
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,919
abstractions on top of this muck to

138
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,320
expose so storage was the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

139
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,270
we expose we call our product<font color="#CCCCCC"> there s3</font>

140
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,340
for a simple storage solution our

141
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,799
computing is we call the elastic compute

142
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,900
cloud or ec2<font color="#CCCCCC"> queueing is another really</font>

143
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,390
useful one in a distributed context and

144
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,969

00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,190
large-scale systems one was influenced

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:44,740
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> something Jim Gray sent said over 20</font>

184
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,699
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we've a desire to be able to</font>

185
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,680
build planetary scale distributed

186
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,300
systems that could potentially be

187
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,169
operated<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a single part time operator</font>

188
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,050
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about that challenge you</font>

189
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to really wonder is it possible</font>

190
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,319
could we provide this muck in the way so

191
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:00,759
the developers don't have to worry about

192
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the abstractions are clean</font>

193
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,919
enough that you really don't care about

194
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,210
what goes on underneath and ideally

195
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,378
would like to be able to do in such a

196
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,818
way that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the people who are</font>

00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,409
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what is below that</font>

198
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,879
abstraction line the network engineers

199
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:16,029
and so on don't have to worry about the

200
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">mock either and that's that's the really</font>

201
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bulk of how we're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

202
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,029
today is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually make that be</font>

203
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,110
as painless as possible here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

204
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:25,450
other questions we've asked

205
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,580
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the key challenges in building</font>

206
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,530
large-scale distributed systems is what

207
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,470
do you do with your persistence<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage</font>

208
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:35,169
and how do you deal with persistence and

209
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,880
and with shared data systems how do you

210
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,890
deal with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric Brewer at Berkeley</font>

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,330
position does the cap theorem so there

212
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,370
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these three things this consistency</font>

213
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,860
availability and network partition

214
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,830
tolerance and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only at any given</font>

215
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,410
time of be guaranteed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide two</font>

216
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">invariance out of these three things so</font>

217
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,890
as you scale you just have to deal with

218
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,469
how do you compromise what trade-offs do

219
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,990
you do and as you all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

220
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,600
partitions they either are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

221
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,100
and you when you're building

222
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,210
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scale you just have to</font>

223
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,890
learn to live with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and figure out</font>

224
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,270
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with them but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

225
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,810
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of control over them they</font>

226
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,100
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen you have to admit that they</font>

227
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,520
they happen that there may be the worst

228
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,750
timed moment availability<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

229
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,610
that we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> strive for one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

230
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,050
percent so as we think about with

231
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,350
respect to share its<font color="#CCCCCC"> stage how do we</font>

232
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,660
manage us we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get into well what</font>

233
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,360
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to consistency to</font>

234
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,790
deal with trade-offs and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually</font>

235
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,590
conclude that hard consistency is an

236
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,530
impossibility in certain systems and you

237
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,000
have to get to a point where you deal

238
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,480
with versioning in deal with eventual

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,520
consistency and convergence if you are

240
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,600
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tolerate those network</font>

241
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:49,630
partitions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh another key challenge that</font>

242
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,280
we think about is dependency discovery

243
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,870
how do we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it real time how do we</font>

244
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,780
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually useful</font>

245
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,760
rather than just a book he get<font color="#CCCCCC"> PE</font>

246
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,949
exercise where like someone goes out in

247
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,420
surveys and five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after they</font>

248
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,150
produce the server results it's

249
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,949
completely out of date so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

250
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,449

251
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,370
you a view into what we've done in this

252
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,430
space to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make it real and make</font>

253
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,870
a useful information can and then would

254
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,979
you pull in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know what your</font>

257
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,580
yourself from the dance train services

258
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,829
and so on that you talk to and the

259
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,550
badness that may occur there and can you

260
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:30,010
actually self heal with respective

261
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,930
communication infrastructure then we try

262
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,579
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how that can be self scale</font>

as well

infinitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> self-healing and load</font>

267
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:46,980
potentially self configuring it's really

268
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,709
important that we take a holistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

269
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:54,839
of our system soon this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> um this is a</font>

270
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:57,268
really in essence on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

271

a dependency map and what it's showing

272
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:03,779
is for the invocation of a single gate

a hundred different services and so from

definitional paper on what web 20 is all

356
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,229
about it he used the phrase software

above the level of a single device and

but that they make requests then to

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,140
either aggregator services or directly

369
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,390
to services that might have sufficient

business logic to provide a fragment of

latency is also a considerable

391
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,680
constraint as we think about how we

392
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,660
engineer the network so just to explain

393
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,209
what you're seeing up here you're seeing

<font color="#CCCCCC">a logarithmic scale graph of a typical</font>

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,030
or write the lower pair of trends are

398
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:12,089
the average latency and the upper on a

399
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:16,890
large scale trends are the 99.9

400
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:18,660
percentile latency so we pay very acute

401
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,370
attention to each of those so

402
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,630
ninety-nine point nine percent others

403
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,880
have you taken up a thousand

405
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,490
at the worst of those thousand and

406
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,219
paying attention to both the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

meet median and the 99.9 percentile

408
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:38,250
makes us really focus on how do we deal

409
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,800
with packet loss how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as the network level</font>

417
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:04,990
so we're also constrained by some

418
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,850
unusual change management rules we don't

419

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,380
involved referencing policy and process

433
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,120
and having to repeat things many times

434
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,980
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really important when you're</font>

435
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,629
building at scale very fast so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think differently about automation in</font>

437
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,550
our environment we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build self</font>

438
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,379
configuring self verifying systems and

439
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,220
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build those systems as as</font>

440
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:16,750
building blocks so that once we we get a

441
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:21,250
certain unit working of I say over a

442
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:23,830
quarry or a data center or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot we</font>

443
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,330
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to then say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we want</font>

444
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,520
to repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> that again so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't to</font>

445
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,710
think about about the detail work that

446
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,590
we went that went into defining the self

447
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,760
configuring system the first time and

448
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,770
then those blocks<font color="#E5E5E5"> build on top of each</font>

449
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,980
other and and so it becomes easier to

450
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with with with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next level of</font>

451
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,770
problem how the building blocks connect

452
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,360
with each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not what we did</font>

453
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:50,200
originally and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> builds api's and</font>

454
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:53,820
self-service web pages to keep humans

out of repetitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric on processes</font>

456
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,080
configuration of various services that

457
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,300
would typically involve network

458
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,710
engineers touching things system

459
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,928
engineers touching things we've

460
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,940
automated to the point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can be</font>

461
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:10,920
called by API so the

462
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:13,570
standard errors are not likely to occur

463
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:20,800
we think differently about policy as

464
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:23,500
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as policy goes it's been</font>

465
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">in my experience that if policy is not</font>

466
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">built it's me if if a policy isn't built</font>

467
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,110
in the process it might as well not

468
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:35,080
exist if policy has to be searched for

469
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,580
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page wiki it may as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

470
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,179
exist people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow it for a</font>

471
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,040
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of time but but as as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

472
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:47,610
build up additional policies then people

473
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:50,710
tend to to not look at past details and

474
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,479
as a result if policy is not Auto

475
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:56,710
enforced by a system it may as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

476
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:01,810
exist so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that leads us to create systems</font>

477
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,670
that verify and enforce policy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

478
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:08,800
talk about those in some more detail in

479
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:10,450
a bit it's important for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to to make</font>

480
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,200
scaling really simple in our environment

481
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:19,590
so that it can be defined by by policies

482
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:22,600
and simplicity is not something that

483
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:30,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes easy simplicity takes work it</font>

484
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:32,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">takes iterations so because of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

485
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,100
levels of growth that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

486
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:39,010
then every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we're working on small</font>

487
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,870
units it's not sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to</font>

488
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about how did we solve the problem</font>

489
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's in front</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us right now but how</font>

490
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,830
we would solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem if it was</font>

491
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:52,000
scaled<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten times and a hundred times and</font>

492
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:54,159
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a challenge to do but</font>

493
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,500
doing so means that when you actually

494
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:00,790
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that step then things work out</font>

495
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:05,320
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well and really that's driven</font>

496
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:06,850
by by this which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we we need to</font>

497
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,470
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy production data</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really make this work we have to to</font>

and networks that you build into your

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,510
network management systems and we've

520
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:12,110
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to automate all of these processes</font>

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we've taken another step further in</font>

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,429
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not just automating the</font>

configuration but automating the the

something is broken and all the steps of

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,100
that investigation process in and taking

532
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,350
those and saying well instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

533
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,790
applying those when network operators

are trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what's broken</font>

535
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,180
let's let's apply them all the time

536
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,890
let's have systems that run they show

537
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,380
commands and looks look for the patterns

538
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,840
the network operators are normally

539
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,210
looking for and then followed the

540
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,740
processes they follow to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so</font>

541
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,110
that we can keep them from from doing

542
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:08,240
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be here strictly defined</font>

543
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:10,459
that way and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat and is it</font>

544
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,980
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic well it's a challenge</font>

but but really it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">course to figure out where to start we</font>

552
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,020
all have operating networks before we

started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this we had a very large</font>

operating network and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

555
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:43,600
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so we have</font>

556
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,690
to treat our running network as the

557
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,810
authoritative resource the network

558
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:52,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">exists it's there has to be the thing</font>

559
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:55,120
that we trust so there are network is

560
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:59,350
our reality and and based upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

561
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,969
reality then we can we've taken small

562
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,550
parts of what we've deployed what we

563
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:07,630
thought we understood is as our policy

564
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:09,879
and define those those bits of policy

565
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:13,180
and then wrote systems to check them

566
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,740
against the configurations and we find

567
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:19,720
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually an iterative process</font>

568
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:22,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">you you may say for example on all 10</font>

569
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,710
gig interfaces you want to attend gig

570

Ethernet interfaces you want to enable

571

flow control and you think that that's

that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy that you're going to</font>

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,800
there you may see well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true</font>

576
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,980
actually in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases and that's</font>

an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to either say are those</font>

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,860
changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in configuration or do we need</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change policy to deal with exceptions</font>

581
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:54,820
to just cycle back around and so of

<font color="#E5E5E5">course we pick that firstly the high</font>

584
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:03,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives us a place to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start never</font>

585
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,840
define everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the sort of process</font>

586
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:09,100
but we do continue the cycle so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

587
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,199
get more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more of that your</font>

589
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,820
it's been a forcing function to to make

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand what the</font>

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:33,220
characteristics for keeping knowledge in

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,600
the network once operators are and

597
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,980
engineers are done work

<font color="#E5E5E5">in particular projects and move on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

599

really consistent normalized repeatable

601
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,270
deployments which is important in terms

602
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:48,100
of getting the building blocks done that

607
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:04,090
gets it simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk about a</font>

608
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:07,900
particular case study involving the

history of multicast at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon must you</font>

00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,490
probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon is is a</font>

611
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:15,250
very heavy user of multicast internally

612
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:19,809
and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been for it for a long time</font>

613
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:23,230
about boats<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 years Stefan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seven years</font>

614
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:26,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah yeah we we started encouraging</font>

615
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:30,220
people to use multicast as a basic

616
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:32,110
transport to make it easy to send

617
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">messages between applications when when</font>

618
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:37,689
they have thousands of servers and so we

619
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:39,460
made it easy for them to do that and the

620
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,100
key to keep design powdering that we

621
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,659
were following was till I

622
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,969
publish-subscribe to happen such that

623
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:46,990
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some interesting data but</font>

624
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,539
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't exactly who might be</font>

625
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,120
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it I might be a change in</font>

626
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:54,340
inventory position that occurs somewhere

627
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,830
like in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big box in Nevada that big</font>

628
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,879
building and it might need to propagate

629
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:03,129
who knows where and what we found is

630
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,600
that both the degree of publishing and

631
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,630
the amount of subscriptions which<font color="#CCCCCC"> drives</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">SD State really grew very quickly this</font>

633
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,919
became very successful from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an adoption</font>

634
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,570
point of view that led<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a lot of</font>

635
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems and complexity getting pushed</font>

636
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,110
down into the network from an operation

637
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,549
point of view yeah so from the

638
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,350
perspective of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developers everything</font>

639
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:22,360
remains simple from my perspective

640
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,939
things became very hectic and so that

641
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,309
represented a need to rather than then

642
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,289
deal with with a complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> system figure</font>

643
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:30,730
out ways to drive it back to towards the

644
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:33,570
simplistic system so that we didn't have

645
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:36,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it anymore and in fact</font>

646
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,370
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had more SG state than</font>

647
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,610
other network in the world at that time

648
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,320
by over<font color="#E5E5E5"> two times it's according to all</font>

649
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:49,770
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was was available then</font>

650
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:52,020
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually challenging the 40 and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the state checking potential of our</font>

652
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,220
vendors hardware and so we worked very

653
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,100
closely with them to figure this out and

654
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:03,620
check we started off<font color="#CCCCCC"> with with a with</font>

655
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,620
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> hem sparse with the SR and</font>

656
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:09,870
eventually we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was</font>

657
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:13,140
getting so popular the the desk BTW

658
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:16,020
failover<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was getting to be quite</font>

659
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,330
expensive on the rps so we built a

660
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:23,910
constraint apology the that allowed us

661
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:29,100
to remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> spt jail over and following</font>

662
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:33,660
following that then we found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

663
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:38,909
needed to to deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast rpe in order</font>

664
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:41,820
to deal with with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the minimization</font>

665
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,680
of joins and and we needed to split that

666
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,560
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eventually to multiple locations</font>

667
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,810
with msdp and these are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of standard</font>

668
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:52,889
design evolutions for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

669
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:55,169
multicast networks and we we found

670
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,300
though that about three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago if</font>

671
00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:02,250
even with come sparse you still have to

672
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:05,940
track us<font color="#CCCCCC"> j state so we we were forced to</font>

673
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:11,340
move to japan biter about about three

674
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:13,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago and actually we were forced to</font>

675
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,600
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the constraints</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of no</font>

676
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,070
no out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of windows and that sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

677
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,330
things we were forced to do all each of

678
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,879
these transitions on a live network

679
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:23,870
without without scheduled outages so

680
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,960
it's been quite a challenge and and

681
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,979
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> once once we moved to tip him and</font>

682
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,840
we did actually all those iterations

683
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,940
over the course of a year once it became

684
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,919
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and and really it got too</font>

685
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,870
simple again once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> moved to bite her</font>

686
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,880
and we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> running with with biter</font>

687
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,800
an hour in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> core for about three</font>

688
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,570
years now we had to build a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

689
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,639
of instrumentation around it and then we

690
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,429
were able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> effectively forget about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

691
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,700
we don't worry about multicast as a

692
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:52,549
major problem anymore and we still have

693
00:29:49,700 --> 00:30:01,399
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> users that use it extensively</font>

694
00:29:52,549 --> 00:30:04,129
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so it I'm actually originally</font>

695
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:06,529
a holistic design and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at</font>

696
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:12,230
the the Maya graph that showed how

697
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:13,610
system calls are related to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

698
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,250
through three different systems and I

699
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,840
think it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about our</font>

700
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems architecture a little bit to</font>

701
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,449
talk to understand how how we consider

702
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:27,010
design holistic in our systems

703
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:31,269
architecture we have generally

704
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:33,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">homogeneous deployments of devices of</font>

705
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:35,510
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're basically the same</font>

706
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:37,940
we have rows of racks of basically the

707
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:41,740
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then as services are</font>

708
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:44,269
required<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they're built as needed</font>

709
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,669
and they're accessed through API so

710
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:48,260
developers can say I i need i need

711
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:51,440
another server of that they make a

712
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,570
system call to they make a call to

713
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,590
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay give me another</font>

714
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of those it actually creates new</font>

715
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,158
assignments of hosts and and then they

716
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:04,250
release them again when they're done

717
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:07,220
with them so to demonstrate this so a

718
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:09,679
subset of a data center here similar

719
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,279
acts of similar servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have an</font>

720
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,950
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> read that comes online and</font>

721
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,389
then makes a call request for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 units</font>

722
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:22,639
without human involvement at all and

723
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:24,889
those applications get placed basically

724
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:28,789
randomly in available spaces through the

725
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:30,649
data centers and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

726
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:32,510
additional application so blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> and green</font>

727
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:34,879
will come online and they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

728
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:39,889
requests through through similar calls

729
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:44,149
and those will be placed at random as

730
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:47,570
well and they'll add and remove them as

731
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:50,120
required and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order for them</font>

732
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:52,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to make a request that says I</font>

733
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,439

735
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,810
has to be an architecture involved that

736
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,910
that understands how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy a blue so</font>

737
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:05,780
so that that's one component that we've

738
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:07,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">had to build here and of course we're</font>

739
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,379
dealing with thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

740
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">applications that are doing this sort of</font>

741
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,990
thing and that leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> us confirm from the</font>

742
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,139
developer side and from the system side

743
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,430
that this keeps everything very simple

744
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,020
but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it leads to really</font>

745
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,960
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flows so if we don't</font>

746
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,030
do anything about it so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just drew a</font>

747
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,250
bunch of lines on here with<font color="#CCCCCC"> OmniGraffle</font>

748
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,960
that are random but represent something

749
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:35,420
that might happen probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be worse</font>

750
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:38,420
than this and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> represents something</font>

751
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,890
that again becomes complex if we don't

752
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,590
do something about it so we have to

753
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,420
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out ways to</font>

754
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:47,090
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this simple again from</font>

755
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,370
our perspective and we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by</font>

756
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,740
creating a variety of services like

757
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:55,280
others there's a discovery service that

758
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:58,760
is required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey I want a blue</font>

759
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">what blues exist and perhaps most</font>

760
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,400
interestingly we have a network locality

761
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,190
service which understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topology</font>

762
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,530
of the network that actually is based on

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,180
on the constraints of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto</font>

764
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,700
deployment system that we referenced

00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:17,720
originally that<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what what's</font>

766
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:20,030
closest to to anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is querying</font>

for it and answers by informed

definition of that topology and that all

769
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:27,200
requires no people to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

770
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:29,480
that process as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so it give an</font>

example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of network locality service and</font>

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,580
that all the point out that nls is a

777
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:51,500
was a unit of work for the within the

778
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,960
entire system so it may be yellow<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

779
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,510
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these deployments and as we need more</font>

780
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,680
nls servers because they have a high

781
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,270
workload then they can also

782
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,390
automatically be deployed into the

783
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:04,809
system and it provides a programmatic

together the greater degree of

build up between systems network and

as network<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers working very</font>

00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:09,859

with how quickly he could get servers or

866
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,039
how quickly he could get data center

trying to do to Amazon and I think he

886
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:06,980
said he he had a loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was running</font>

and one of the interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

897
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,019
he came up with in that whole search

00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:38,079
going back to the you know hundred fifty

899
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:42,700

Randy you go first well maybe a space

cadet um Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush iij what happened</font>

927
00:39:51,810 --> 00:40:00,080
last week it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take long to the top</font>

928
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:07,109
we're pushing out more details over time

929
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,090
but basically we had Ahad Randy's

930
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,130
referring to is on Friday<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning we'd a</font>

931
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,740
problem with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our services</font>

932
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:16,920
that impacted summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> East Coast data</font>

933
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,859
centers and it was a problem that should

934
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,220
have been eminently fixable and findable

935
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:24,840
but wasn't and we're diving in we hate

936
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,390
to disappoint customers and have any

937
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,580
adage of any type in any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our services</font>

938
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,589
so we're diving into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and figuring</font>

939
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,960
out how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do future prevent I'm not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">asking for blame I'm asking do you have</font>

941
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,620
any lessons so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know all of us</font>

942
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,330
are in the same or van boats do you have

943
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,520
you learned anything yet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font>

944
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:47,040
learn so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to us I</font>

945
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,930
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of the key lessons</font>

946
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,550
Randy is with respect to how you think

947
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,919
about dependency mapping and thinking

948
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:58,950
about even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most obscure contributors</font>

949
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:02,100
that that contribute to providing any

950
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:04,379
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level service you need to</font>

951
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,270
do incredibly rigorous testing of the

952
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,000
edge cases and of the obscure service

953
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:12,450
failures and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you do back</font>

954
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,850
off and recovery such that the edge

955
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,620
cases kind of add up and and cause

956
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:19,350
anything else to tumble down at higher

957
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,580
levels it's a it's I think it's it's a

958
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,860
real challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a service-oriented</font>

959
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,870
architecture like what we've built where

960
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,180
you know people a lot of the newer

961
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:30,180
applications being built are mashing

962
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:33,089
together different api's and you really

963
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:36,440
have to think quite dependent quite

964
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:40,290
defensively<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved multiple failures</font>

965
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,030
know that interact actually really

966
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">single failure that had cascading</font>

967
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:47,490
effects at higher levels yeah so you

968
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,410
really have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think very closely about</font>

969
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you defend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself and have the</font>

970
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,839
edge case doesn't affect the common

971
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,630
case of what people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do I</font>

972
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:59,020
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the thing less and</font>

973
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:02,230
feel free to chat to me more Randy next

974
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:06,460
question in the middle okay go ahead yes

975
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:09,420
and Johnson<font color="#E5E5E5"> C packet networks so I was</font>

976
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:14,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interested in the concept of</font>

977
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:19,870
locality and in how you decide what the

00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:21,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">port's best quotes server might be so</font>

979
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:24,609
would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

980

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide said IP addresses but</font>

981
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,150
there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more to it than just</font>

982
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:33,570
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the closest IP address and how</font>

983
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:33,570
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you define closest in general this</font>

984
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:39,520
bestest are necessarily the absolute

985
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,920
closest because in many cases half a

986
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,509
millisecond doesn't really matter and so

987
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:51,910
with respect to how we provide answers

988
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:53,950
we r you what we respond in the order of

989
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list that you get back is impacted</font>

990
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:58,500
by available capacity not just

991
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:01,450
topological proximity does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

992
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,100
that helps yes thank you another

993
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,330
dimension of this is we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

994
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,830
figure out how to expose this or

995
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,029
external developers obviously because

996
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:12,610
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that external developers</font>

997
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:14,860
are are very interested in and and we're

998
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,780
open to input on what form people would

999
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,540
like that to take but one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1000
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,670
does look attractive is what allows you

1001
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:24,310
what in an external developer to think

1002
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:28,330
about fault zones and the different

1003
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:30,279
pieces of the topology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

1004
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:32,319
potential to fail together and what you

1005
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,000
want but what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in terms of</font>

that uses a lot of interesting

technology to sell crap to a company

1023

that's selling its technological muck

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to me about that is was that</font>

something that was always<font color="#E5E5E5"> schemed about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">does that impact the role that people</font>

like you guys have in your organization

1035
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,600

1038
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,690
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feeling that an Amazon maybe</font>

not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much anymore so can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk a</font>

1041
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,500

1047
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,660
what we did find as we evolved was that

1048
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,030
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> built a lot of really useful</font>

1049
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:19,859
technology that we that only we were

1050
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:22,110
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and slowly we started to for</font>

00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,120
e-commerce platform technology we

1052
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,740
started to like have other sites like

1053
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,089
Target and Marks and Spencers and swim

1054
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,069
would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run on top of that but</font>

1055
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,420
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there were very useful</font>

1056
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:34,200
primitive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could expose to</font>

1057
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:37,140
outsiders and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and did that</font>

1058
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,120
and our hope and expectation is a battle

1059
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,350
turned into a material business for us

1060
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,359
and it's growing nicely we're very

1061
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,430
surprised and pleased with how small

1062

they're really informing how we shape

people who've been as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can imagine we</font>

00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:04,259
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> built a lot of this technology</font>

assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it wouldn't be exposed to</font>

1072
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,630
some random developer who knows where

1073
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,430
and

1074
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,500
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to change our culture with</font>

1075
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:14,649
respect to everything we build now with

1076
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,630
the expectation that at some point in

1077
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,700
time it's very likely that it will get

1078
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:22,560
exposed so builders with a view to

1083
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,980
Blair with Cisco you're managing a lot

1084
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:41,530
of complex information flows in a

1085
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:44,740
hopefully simple way from the user point

1086
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:47,200
of view do you do you consider symmetry

1087
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,000
of information flow or asymmetry of

1088
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,640
information flow if you'll analyze that

1089
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,600
as how it impacts meeting your your

1090
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:59,850
overall availability<font color="#E5E5E5"> goals you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check</font>

1091
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:03,970
well it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what level the</font>

1092
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:06,069
symmetry is important for in some areas

1093
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:11,020
of our network design especially where

1094
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:14,170
where where any<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a concern I</font>

1095
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:18,490
think if symmetry generally more as a

1096
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:20,740
matter of something that is applied

1097
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:23,200
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to network designs rather than</font>

1098
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:26,009
then flows though what I guess what I'm

1099
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,399
getting is I've seen that the goals of

1100
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:32,230
troubleshooting and performance can have

1101
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">op depending on what your symmetrical or</font>

1102
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:37,210
asymmetrical are kind of in opposition I

1103
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:40,210
was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you if you've actually</font>

1104
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:42,220
thought about that or if you have

1105
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:45,850
anything on that I think asymmetry is

1106
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:48,359
like at network partitions they and lots

1107
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:51,069
of other perturbations and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale</font>

1108
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:55,810
environment it'll just exist you have to

1109
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:58,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with that and a lot of the flows</font>

1110
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:00,940
that we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with are fairly</font>

1111
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,830
tightly localized though I went once

1112
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">they go through the lookup process so</font>

1113
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:08,340
they tend to be symmetric and in local

1114
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,339
local area

1115
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:13,000
yeah do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know an Cisco regarding</font>

1116
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,350
Randy's questions about the outs is due

1117
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,520
to edge cases do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see your edge cases</font>

1118
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:20,890
increasing drastically a little bit

1119
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,360
flattening going down and are they at

1120
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,609
the application level a network level

1121
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,590
all over the place and are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1122
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything to simplify your network so</font>

1123
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:31,650
there are less edge cases I think the

1124
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:35,920
biter example is a good example of a

1125
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:37,570
radical degree of simplification and you

1126
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,670
know like my see tons comment about the

1127
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Russia which are the French Revolution</font>

1128
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,790
it may be too early to tell how well

1129
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:46,320
that's working but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's has been pretty</font>

1130
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:46,320
stable for about three years or more

1131
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,820
simplicity is the first design principle

1132
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:55,300
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always consider every time a</font>

1133
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:58,930
bunch of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> get in a room and think</font>

1134
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,520
about a design it's hard hard to get

1135
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:07,660
more specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that Dina</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are your</font>

1136
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:12,070
edge case is increasing I haven't trend

1137
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:13,540
to them I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not we</font>

1138
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,800
have interesting maybe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

1139
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,630
do you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about all</font>

1140
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,750
your edge cases until they happen one

1141
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:24,940
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one thing that does</font>

1142
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:26,890
influence how we do designs is we we try

1143
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do pretty rapid prototyping and</font>

1144
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:32,859
provide minimal functionality early and

1145
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,780
allow the use of that early prototyping

1146
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,350
and like alpha and beta releases to

1147
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:40,390

1148
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,750
built over time so we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not</font>

1149
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:45,250
release very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> full-featured services</font>

1150
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:47,860
we strive for simplicity in the design

1151
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:51,220
process and have our customers influence

1152
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:52,840
what gets added on over time so let me

1153
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask you a direct question as a protocol</font>

designer if you wanted to add new

<font color="#CCCCCC">functionality to your network would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1156
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,069
prefer a new protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be added to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mix or would you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to modify an</font>

existing protocol to make it happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1159
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:08,770
have any preferences it depends on what

1160
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:12,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">were talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about specifically may only</font>

1161
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:16,570
have to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what makes sense for</font>

1162
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:19,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">four they hit the end goal and it don't</font>

1163
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:23,200
need more protocols increases<font color="#CCCCCC"> op x</font>

1164
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:24,969
any opinions generally adding adding

1165
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,089
additional protocols is not desirable

1166
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:32,739
but but sometimes things will<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll get</font>

1167
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:35,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to maybe we we keep expanding so as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1168
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:37,569
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at at higher level designs and</font>

1169
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:39,430
how to deal with with with larger and

1170
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:41,380
larger systems then sometimes there's a

1171
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:44,499
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go beyond</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we've done before</font>

1172
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:46,479
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one last quick question so</font>

1173
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:48,399
centralization versus distributed I'm

1174
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:50,379
sure you guys have played<font color="#CCCCCC"> debt accordion</font>

1175
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,259
either way do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lean one way or the</font>

1176
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,369
other I mean there's a it always pulls a

1177
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:56,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade-off with network management</font>

1178
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:59,109
obviously in terms of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we organize</font>

1179
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:01,420
our entire technology organization we

1180
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:04,150
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be as distributed as possible and</font>

1181
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:06,309
to minimize the inter communication

1182
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:08,650
between teams and have as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

1183
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:10,539
communication happen through clean heart

1184
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a P is so that people don't have to</font>

1185
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:14,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to each other and ideally api's</font>

1186
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:16,059
that are pretty self-describing so that

1187
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:17,828
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consumer of them and just</font>

1188
00:51:16,059 --> 00:51:23,950
look and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay well I have a good a</font>

1189
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:26,729
sense of how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks</font>

1190
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,729
very much for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and</font>

1191
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:35,359
thanks to Josh for finally twisting our

1192
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,390
arms hard enough than<font color="#E5E5E5"> to got us to come</font>
