two to three hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts related to</font>

to that whole process they<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided to</font>

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:39,300
break up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mpls work group and and</font>

course a place in which providers can

IETF and my recollection was that it was

pretty soundly rejected but apparently

63
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,980
they formed a<font color="#E5E5E5"> work group however the</font>

68
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:12,340
provide input to the I Triple E so the I

vendors had been claiming that this

optic stuff is really hard and new

97
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,990
router vendors could never possibly

00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:56,919
understand it some people have tried to

<font color="#E5E5E5">quantify that there are problems with if</font>

you know what they're talking about the

and only use one optical switch vendor

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> interoperability at one point</font>

either get 1 times whatever OC 48 or OC

with requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a provision</font>

132
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,229
in there and it suggested that with a

change to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Charter and they're not</font>

really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nap completely so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

on whether the oif you and I is of any

been interest in that area put it that

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,600
way in fact you know we're we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> did a</font>

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,590
press release on it so I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

144
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,180
we're kind of interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> too but the</font>

148
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,549
some reason there are providers that

149
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,199
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful</font>

150
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,740
and the optical switch under sink that

151
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,470
this is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful and there are</font>

152
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:49,390
others who don't feel it's useful so far

153
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:52,800
the oh I fu and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I has over or a you and</font>

154
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:55,569
I has not become an official worker

156
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:01,630
and my personal opinion is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

157
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,579
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are enough people that don't want</font>

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,090

163
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,490
opinions of course do vary

164
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:29,150
see camp in theory see campus sits above

165
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,450
mpls and it also sits above ATM and

166
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:37,520
frame relay and TDM and everything else

167
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,050
there are others who actually don't

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,100
be that there's only one draft right now

the useful work was going on and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

207
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,189
has been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very productive work group</font>

208
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,860
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint that there are quite</font>

209
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,839
a number of rfcs now out of the work

210
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,250
group there are there's an enormous list

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,980
of internet-drafts that our workgroup

212
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:17,639
drafts they don't necessarily match the

213

Charter and but part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

214
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,060
because over the last year the iesg has

215
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,740
been shuffling work groups around and

216
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,369
everybody's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been submitting their</font>

drafts to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpls workgroup until the</font>

218
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:36,180
whole thing settled down there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

219
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,850
lot of interoperability testing and

220
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,560
there's been some deployment so it's I

221
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:48,569
would have to say that's a productive

222
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:50,130
work group<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a list of the</font>

the anything the GM pls set is up for

227
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:18,180
last call the RSVP LSP tunnels work is

228
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:20,189
in the RFC editors<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands and I believe</font>

229
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,359
that should come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out pretty soon that's</font>

230
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:26,579
I guess that's number four on the list

231
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,149
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LDP stuff i believe is already</font>

236
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,740
so quite a number of the of the drafts

237
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,250
on this list are either in the IES<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez</font>

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:52,800
or in the RFC editors hands there is

247
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,670

and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to do that has bounced</font>

250
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,650
around you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> work group to do</font>

251
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,520
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> its currently thought to be</font>

252
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:38,970
secant so all the drafts are still

253
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,610
individual submissions and the probably

254
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:47,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rule that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will prevail is those with</font>

implementations will survive<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this</font>

256
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,230
is a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the RFC's that are</font>

is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp specification</font>

259
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:05,610
applicability and I thought the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop</font>

260
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:11,219
prevention these these have all gone RFC

261
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:14,730
the tea stuff is lagging because it's

262
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,440
still in the RFC editors some hands so

263
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,360
there should be just another short list

264
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,780
at least two more documents should come

265
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">out quickly</font>

that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up hierarchical tunnels</font>

lot of interest in TDM over at first

optical burst switching which is

essentially a TDM technology over an

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:24,340
in order to need traffic engineering you

385
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:27,908
need traffic so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so where is the sub area</font>

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,889
headed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPLS work group was was</font>

00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:33,850
headed in every direction all at once

388
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,950
and you know the sub area was<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed</font>

389
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:41,320
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the chaos was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font>

390
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:43,990
to help sort out the chaos and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

391
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,970
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually helping it is it has</font>

392
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,760
helped weed out the contributions the

393
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:54,460
quote contribution some of which were a

394
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:57,879
junk dress or the end I might note that

395
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,669
the the IPO<font color="#E5E5E5"> work group probably holds</font>

396
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:05,909
all records for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of framework</font>

397
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:05,909
documents proposed by a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> workgroup</font>

398
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,149
so the IETF is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

399
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,120
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that they actually</font>

400
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:15,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement things that are useful which</font>

401
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,760
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a nice thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for them to do</font>

402
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:21,129
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the routing area has an</font>

403
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">additional requirement that is not a</font>

404
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,669
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of general internet-drafts</font>

405
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,600
and that is that there'd be two

406
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:31,990
interoperable implementations and my

407
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,240
personal opinion is that the IP sub area

408
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,520
should also have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement and</font>

409
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:43,919
I've expressed that to a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

410
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:45,730
ESG members this the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

411
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,590
things that people have actually

412
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,029
implemented as opposed to ideas that

413
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,699
people propose and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sure</font>

414
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:57,269
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to implement it or not</font>

415
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,269
and that's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>
