00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,910

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,559
work going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to actually interconnect</font>

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,240
content delivery networks how many

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,129
people know what content delivery

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,140
networks are familiar at least with the

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,150
term<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good so this presentation can</font>

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,869
start out talking about a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">about content delivery networks and then</font>

10
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:29,580
set the stage for talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about actually</font>

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,470
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ways that several people and</font>

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">about interconnecting content delivery</font>

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,489

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,850
ISPs are connected at the IP level and

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,949
then I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sum up and talk a</font>

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,920
little bit about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> testbed that's being</font>

rolled out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this so content overlay</font>

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,850

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">site performance so basically</font>

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,730
distributed web hosting model there's a

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of commercial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns a lot of ISPs are</font>

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,580
specialized servers that look very much

29
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,350
like web servers with a couple

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,380
exceptions and then there's another

31
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,490
component to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it CDM which is a DNS</font>

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,110
first there's a distribution system

35
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,740
which is a fancy name for all the

36
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,840
surrogates they're out there these

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,658
surrogates often communicate using a set

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,420
of protocols for distribution and cache

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,130
coherency and things like that there's

40
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,710
also another domain which is what we

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,100
call request routing and this is what's

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,829
put on top of DNS or with DNS to direct

43
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,829
users to the closest piece of content in

44
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,389
a distribution system and there's also

45
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,270
the accounting<font color="#E5E5E5"> billing stuff of course</font>

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boring part a simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

47
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the CDN and again I'm setting</font>

48
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,780
stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 talking about interconnection of</font>

49
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:15,850
content delivery networks in this

50
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:19,630
picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a client here who is</font>

looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a request that is a</font>

52
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,200
particularly well for example that could

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,600
be distributed on a content delivery

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,429
network so the first thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,209
there's a request that goes to its local

56
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:34,510
dns server<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns will typically either</font>

57
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:38,380
embed their their own DNS names into

58
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:42,819
URLs or they'll actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cname</font>

59
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:46,840
that references references their dns

60
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:49,179
from a customer name the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing of</font>

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,450
course is the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> will contact its</font>

62
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,459
local<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns server which will go through a</font>

63
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,910
whole bunch of processes to eventually

64
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,709
get down to the to resolve the CDN names

65
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,019
I've left out like the root server look

66
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,390
up and such eventually it will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

67
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:07,569
request router which is owned by the CDN

68
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,160
is authoritative for the CDN you know

69
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,488
this special name that's doing the

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,850
request routing of course that will

71
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,140
return the closest IP address to

72
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,209
whatever you define is<font color="#CCCCCC"> close i mean</font>

73
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">people use a variety of metrics and a</font>

74
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,730
variety of algorithms the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

75
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:27,549
course will then contact the local

76
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,709
surrogate in the CDN network that is

77
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,900
Rita the IP address that's returned from

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,459
the quest router if the circuit doesn't

79
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,799
have the content typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pulled</font>

80
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:41,230
on demand though with streaming media of

81
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,220
course push is also used as well request

82
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,060
rounding is probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

83
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,070
interesting part of cns it's the global

84
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,170
load balancing piece and knowing where

85
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,910
content is is as well as doing

86
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">measurements to determine which</font>

87
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,220
surrogate is the best one to serve a

88
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,859
given client this is where you know the

89
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">quote unquote black art is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in CDN it's</font>

90
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:03,310
also the piece that's interesting with

91
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,470
respect to when I start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

92
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,299
inner connection of<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs because the</font>

93
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,980
request reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> system is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

94
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:14,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inner connection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens so right</font>

95
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,159
now simple

96
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:23,389
in terms of what the user see the user

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:24,889
season modified URL and a web page again

98
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,220
just walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the distribution</font>

99
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:30,500
system again it's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really is in a CDN</font>

100
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,419
the distribution system really is the

101
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,350
overlay Network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the request router</font>

102
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:38,000
is the actual the request router using

103
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS is really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote routers</font>

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,380
of the CDN one other interesting point

105
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:47,419
that that's come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns is because</font>

106
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:51,770
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDN is serving lots of different</font>

107
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:55,639
customers you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

108
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,409
host header to determine which URLs

109
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,630
you're actually serving because of

110
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,090
course you could have overlapping easily

111
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:06,169
have overlapping directory names within

112
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,119
a URL space so use the host header again

113
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,789
just like a standard virtual server on a

114
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,130
web server but you also have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

115
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,930
idea of an origin server which is where

116
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:18,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually retrieve the content if</font>

117
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,960
it's if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the other</font>

118
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,300
thing is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because CDNs are operating</font>

119
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,940
on behalf of an origin server which is

120
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,010
what makes them different from web

121
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,950
caches is that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

122
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,080
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that the origin server or the</font>

123
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,700
user themselves can actually control the

124
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,770
content in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network so there's a set</font>

125
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,219
of signaling protocols that happen in a

126
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:44,740
CDN as well so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk</font>

127
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:49,490
about interconnection of these networks

128
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:53,960
the I've drawn a very very rough analogy

129
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,060
here and let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me let me walk through</font>

130
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,700
these pieces in a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three network of</font>

131
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,970
course we all know routers route packets

132
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:05,570
in a CDN we have DNS requests routers

133
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:11,450
that route DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests or user requests</font>

134
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:15,169
to a best surrogate in layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of</font>

135
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,990
course the units<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information that are</font>

136
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:20,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">being exchanged and being what's up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

137
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,550
routes in a CDN you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

138
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,390
for is content so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really looking</font>

139
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,390
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs</font>

140
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,270
interconnecting a layer three networks

141
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,960
basically means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've agreed to</font>

142
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:37,270
carry traffic for another network

143
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,690
interconnecting a CDN means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

144
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,330
agreed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serve content on behalf of</font>

145
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,389
another CDN and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately on behalf of</font>

146
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,099
an origin server and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course right now</font>

you're an ISP and you're deploying your

in CDN how do you compete with somebody

you might want to do is you might want

to actually create some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,440
there's several quote-unquote tier 1

184

<font color="#CCCCCC">CDNs on are currently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

networks

190
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,919
is that the primary value proposition of

191
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,029
a CDN is quality of service so you're

192
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,100
basically trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get around the</font>

packet loss at network access points and

194
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,480
at private peering points so what we

195
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:53,040
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that</font>

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,570
once we interconnect CD ends that we

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,130
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't destroy that so it seems</font>

198
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:03,029
many people believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we need at</font>

199
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,490
the CDN<font color="#E5E5E5"> interconnection is a much much</font>

200
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:08,040
more intricate set of ways for

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:13,380
expressing quality of service

202
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:16,050
information and one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons why</font>

203
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,430
some people you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know will dis believe or</font>

204
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,990
not believe this is because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

205
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,489
difficulty in doing this and I I

definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledge that this is a</font>

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge challenge one of the</font>

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">other difficulties with with actually</font>

209
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,139
having quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of service between</font>

210
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:35,880
providers is that when you introduce

211
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,790
arbitrary topologies into the network

212
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,750
you end up with a hard problem of how to

213
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:45,149
solve routing loops in CDN it may be

214
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,829
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve this problem there's</font>

215
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,449
many of us that believe it will be

216
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:50,760
because since idioms are overlay

217
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:52,500
networks you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have to have</font>

218
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,010
there's no in others there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

219
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,079
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have arbitrary hierarchy of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns you</font>

220
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,140
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just directly connect because</font>

221
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,760
everybody is basically at the same level

222
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,120
the network since everyone's an overlay

223
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,250
Network the other interesting thing

224
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,260
that's slightly different with cdna our

225
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,870
connection is that you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take into</font>

226
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,899
account paranoia about content assets so

227
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,459
there's a you know the SLA s and the

228
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,500
offline negotiation might be a little

229
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:22,199
bit more complex because people are

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,149
worried about you know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

231
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:25,620
distribute my content they probably what

232
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">a content providers probably wouldn't</font>

233
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:33,660
want arbitrary<font color="#E5E5E5"> handoff of serving their</font>

234
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:34,889
content so right now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this work</font>

235
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,089
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about now</font>

236
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:40,889
is is basically result of some work in

237
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,680
the ITF there's been two boss and I

238
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit but we've</font>

239
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,579
basically generally generally have a

240
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,960
have a model that we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with for</font>

241
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:57,170
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with some of these</font>

242
00:10:51,960 --> 00:11:01,230
providers that are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in hearing</font>

243
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:04,020
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this works is that each piece</font>

244
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> content has an authoritative CDN so</font>

245
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,670
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the master CDN or the</font>

246
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,820
CDM that has the relationship with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

247
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:16,890
content provider and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty easily</font>

248
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:19,170
identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the DNS name that points</font>

249
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:23,750
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the request router and the</font>

250
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,130
authoritative CDN the authoritative CDN

251
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,070
will then get the request from the

252
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,800
clients of course so it can then decide

253
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:34,290
whether it wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serve the content or</font>

254
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,880
whether another network should serve the

255
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:41,189
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> and right now this is based on</font>

256
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,980
basically some arbitrary decisions that

257
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision making process that is</font>

258
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:52,890
being corporated into various products

259
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:56,339
and proprietary implementations once the

260
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:58,770
request is directed to another network

261
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,730
of course then that network will serve

262
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:04,920
the content and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> there has to be some</font>

263
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,750
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of offline SLA just like in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

264
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,020
kind of interconnection or appearing

265
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,700
where you negotiate some kind of you

266
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,069
know bandwidth you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

267
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,720
negotiation of bandwidth for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns as</font>

268
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,240
well because a lot of that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

269
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,150
way a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of students builder on other</font>

270
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,980
customers but there's a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

271
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be taken into account</font>

272
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to keep track of</font>

273
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,940
which networks are authorized to

274
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,250
distribute which content and you also

275
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,650
probably want to make note of which

276
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,050
networks actually have the content so

277
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,720
for pull based distribution this isn't

278
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,040
so much an issue but when you talk about

279
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,460
push-based distribution for<font color="#E5E5E5"> streaming</font>

280
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,839
media it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely important the</font>

281
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,400
other thing that word<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're doing</font>

282
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we're taking what we call black box</font>

283
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,490
approach so we're abstracting a network

284
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,480
very much in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP can</font>

285
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,690
aggregate a bunch of routes and

286
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:04,449
track the internal topology away we're

287
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:07,990
doing the same thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs so a</font>

288
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:11,740

between<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs when you want to</font>

291
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,519
interconnect them is you have to have

292
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,500
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of way to determine what</font>

293
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,570
information or what content should be

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">distributed between the networks what</font>

295
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,220
content types are supported so if I

296
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:30,279
support real media serving and you

297
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,870
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows Media then you know how</font>

298
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,410
do we resolve that or do we not just

299
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,480
distribute content between us when is

300
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,370
the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready so in a push based</font>

301
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,709
distribution once the content is pushed

302
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,550
you want to actually acknowledge that

303
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:47,829
you actually have the information and

304
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:51,399
accounting information has to be

305
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:53,680
propagated to the authoritative CDN so

306
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,410
that it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either give logs to its</font>

interface to its customers it's also

required for<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-tiered settlement</font>

310
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,519
which there's been some commercial

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,350
proposals for multi-tier settlement

providers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting together to</font>

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:23,470
propose a multi-tier settlement model

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:26,529
for CDN<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter connection so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

317
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,420
really high level you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see DNS</font>

318
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:31,480
and what I have is in this case I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

319
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:34,779
CDN has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote unquote global footprint</font>

320
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,209
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I have an ISP here that might</font>

321
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:40,449
have its own CDN and let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is P</font>

322
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,790
is a smaller regional ISP that the CDN

323
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:45,639
is the larger CDN doesn't actually have

324
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,519
sir gets in there so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually wants</font>

325
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,589
to have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inter connection</font>

326
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:54,910
here so the content provider still has a

327
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:57,810
relationship with cdna and<font color="#CCCCCC"> these CPGs or</font>

328
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,490
content peering gateways as we call them

329
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,729
basically talk some kind of protocols to

330
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:07,940
interconnect the

331
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:10,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">too so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that we're initially</font>

332
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be looking at doing request</font>

333
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:16,969
routing between<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs through the use of</font>

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:19,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">dns see names again another picture here</font>

335
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:24,199
with the client looking up a dns name

336
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:28,399
that is part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the authoritative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns</font>

337
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:33,050
namespace<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if that CDN decides to</font>

338
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,089
redirect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the request in step 3 where the</font>

339
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,310
request routing component is actually

340
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:41,899
making decision then it will return a

341
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:45,349
cname which will point to CDN<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so you</font>

342
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:47,899
actually make use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> C names to do hand</font>

343
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,149
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the request so it works pretty</font>

344
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:55,670
nicely and what's being<font color="#CCCCCC"> using the test</font>

345
00:15:50,149 --> 00:16:01,190
bed so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just walks through it the</font>

346
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:05,959
more concrete example so provider a has

347
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:11,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular site or its particular</font>

348
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:13,849
authoritative name is CDN blog com then

349
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:18,230
a would be authoritative for that name

350
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:23,410
which could be a dns name cody<font color="#E5E5E5"> block com</font>

351
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:26,149
org law com could be a cname in 2 a's

352
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,250
authoritative request routing system so

353
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:31,610
provider be wants to distribute the

354
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:35,810
content or to interconnect<font color="#CCCCCC"> it must apply</font>

355
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,779
a cname for redirection of that site and

356
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,979
then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there's a policy at</font>

357
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,319
provider and the interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

358
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,199
here is that it is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hierarchical so</font>

359
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:47,329
the authoritative request routing system

360
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,519
makes a decision and then hands off the

361
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:52,638
request down so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is another</font>

362
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,069
thing that's slightly different from IP

363
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,690
routing where you can kind of hot potato

364
00:16:55,069 --> 00:17:02,240
around to whoever you want this is

365
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:05,179
pretty strictly hierarchical right now

366
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,069
as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were focusing on DNS for</font>

367
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,949
the first ways to actually interconnect

368
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,990
content networks but there's also

369
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,720
another way which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually used layer</font>

370
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">7 switches so layer 7 switches have</font>

371
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,819
typically

372
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:22,339
been used at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web hosting center to</font>

373
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,589
distribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests between web servers</font>

374
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,020
but if you actually move those switches

375
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:31,750
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge of the network you can do</font>

376
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,750
fancy things we actually intercept a

377
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,780
request at the edge of the network and

378
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,200
direct it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nearest server and</font>

379
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,560
avoid the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS lookup so right now DNS is</font>

380
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,660
used because it's convenient it works

381
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,720
across the across the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

382
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:54,110
could actually deploy a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 request</font>

383
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:56,030
routing system so for short term for the

384
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,090
test bed and for some of the protocols

385
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:01,520
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at DNS with with mesh</font>

386
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,990
connectivity so no arbitrary topologies

387
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,020
and actually arbitrary technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

388
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:09,260
probably get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of performance</font>

389
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,180
problems to that you don't want so what

390
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,970
you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it the way this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

391
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work is the hierarchy will be one or</font>

392
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,520
possibly two levels deep and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's and</font>

393
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:22,310
that's all so you don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tremendous</font>

394
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">delay with DNS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> request routing and then</font>

395
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:29,450
later on we'll figure out how to

396
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:30,889
integrate it in with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer 7 as we</font>

397
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,630
move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to have some</font>

398
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,060
protocols to exchange times will you

399
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,370
know dynamic information right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

400
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:41,600
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um is</font>

401
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,979
being statically configured so another

402
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,000
analogy would be we're doing static

403
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,550
routing right now right now in some of

404
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,250
the architecture drafts framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafts</font>

405
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,230
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nit f we have concept of a</font>

406
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:58,520
Content peering gateway this is

407
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:01,280
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

408
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:06,020
interconnect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two CDNs and exchange</font>

409
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,270
information so the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

410
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,520
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exchange or we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

411
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,740
useful to exchange is<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote unquote</font>

412
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,830
coverage areas so what you do is you map

413
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,440
your CDN into effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> what your</font>

414
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,360
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 network coverage is and the</font>

415
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,590
second piece that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

416
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,370
specific content related information

417
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:29,189
what content do you have and you know is

418
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:32,789
it ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be served what types content</font>

419
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,970
types do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you support etc etc lots of</font>

420
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,929
information needs to be exchanged in

421
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,720
reality what will probably happen is

422
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:42,539
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information will probably be pretty</font>

423
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,100
aggregate especially at the stuff thats

424
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:49,440
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> content so we're probably</font>

425
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:54,389
operated to hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> two first two levels of</font>

426
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:57,000
it of a URL if you will there's a whole

bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting problems in CDN</font>

428
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,659
interconnexion one of the things i want

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stress is that this is very bleeding</font>

430
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:06,480
edge stuff there's a couple people that

with this is this is very bleeding edge

434
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,919
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of problems to left to</font>

435
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,840
solve and and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was involved</font>

00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">in some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the early am bone stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

437
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,459
think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would i would compare what we're</font>

438
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,379
doing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now to some of the very very</font>

439
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,230
early stuff in the embo where we're

440
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,620
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn about this learn how</font>

442
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:38,070
still provide quality of service with

443
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,959
the CDN that's interconnected etc etc so

444
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">these are some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenging</font>

445
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,840
problems to solve you know how do you

446
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,980
make a routing decision what<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

447
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,559
has to be exchanged<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you prevent</font>

448
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:55,399
information overload how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ensure</font>

metadata updates like purges between the

452
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:07,830
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs so again very this is all of</font>

453
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:11,880
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> bleeding edge to see there's</font>

something called<font color="#CCCCCC"> content Alliance which</font>

455
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,929
again some of you may not there's these

460
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:30,908
these problems so right now there's a

466
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:45,879
at the bottom CDI test bed net is not

468
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:52,689
but 18 p is coordinating this test bed

469
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:54,248
and we have several vendors and service

00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,929
use the testbed to try to figure out how

00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:23,590
this stuff is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work in the real</font>

world here's a list of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

draft so far that are part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob's</font>

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,759
and will be part of the working group a

506
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:33,849
lot of kind of framework type stuff

507
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:36,099
we're putting together requirements see

508
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:38,259
some requirements documents up there for

509
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:40,239
the interconnection of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems so</font>

510
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,809
when we go to actually do protocols we

511
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,730
have something

512
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:44,549
the reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> off of and there are some</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually starting to do some</font>

514
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:53,110
protocol work so summary there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

515
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,799
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve this is a brand</font>

516
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:58,240
new area let's say it's of interest to a

517
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,918
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people here because a lot of</font>

518
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,159
service providers are building their own

519
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">cdns there's been a couple and I'm not</font>

520
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to mention names but there's been</font>

00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:07,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple large service providers that</font>

522

have announced either that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

CDN we have this test bed up and running

525
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,408
and right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing static routing</font>

526
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:21,340
but we probably will be adding some

00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:24,249
dynamic information exchange and your

528
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,610
input is<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatly appreciated and if</font>

00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:29,110
you're interested in looking at the test

530
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,629
paddocks I think there's an email

531
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">address up there if there isn't come</font>

okay thanks
