in these virtual private networks is a

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,160
major issue as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the security of</font>

security so here's a quick simplified

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,859
view of what I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

63
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:15,260
say a LAN tool and VPN the second is

style VPNs these are tunnels that

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,070
typically connect a single node to a

73
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,030
why access policies as well can be

74
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,500
centrally controlled and that can be

75
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,760
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important when you're dealing with</font>

76
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,350
a disparate group of users so again

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,179
another simplified view of what I'm

78
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:55,220
talking about when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say client tool and</font>

80
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,790
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges again what i mean</font>

81
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,940
by these these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things that are</font>

assume the worse with<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT and tell your</font>

103

customers that up front some NAT

104
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,240
implementations won't even allow a

will allow single tunnels will be

107
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,870

108
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,590
that are created tear<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the initial</font>

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,900
thing that comes with the territory

150
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,630
first of all the tool sets that

151
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:06,750
that are provided with many products are

152
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:09,120
fairly immature the varying standard

153
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,889
implementations of the protocols make

154
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,880
root cause finger pretty difficult and

155
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:16,800
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it if your</font>

156
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,300
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem where one of</font>

157
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,090
their end users is having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font>

158
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:26,550
creating a tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your to their</font>

159
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:29,190
network depending on what what device

160
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,180
you're using it's not obvious what's

161
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on and that's difficult the very</font>

162
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,889
nature of Virtual Private networking

163
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,060
makes troubleshooting very complex

164
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,949
obviously they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry some</font>

165
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,960
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of important traffic between their</font>

167
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,109
your side so once when there is trouble

168
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,330
sniffing packets is useless in between

169
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,349
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously they're homogeneous</font>

170
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:58,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">and encrypted again another another</font>

171
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:01,590
another thing that we've brought to bear

172
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,859
to address these issues is building some

173
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of IPSec debug target you can think</font>

180
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,888
complexity of your implementation by

181
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,960
trying to enforce product standards and

182
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,810
ensuring the number of devices vendor

183
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,848
combinations<font color="#CCCCCC"> is minimal and structure</font>

access networks with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the devices that</font>

185
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,969
accommodate simple packet inspection so

186
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,890
this means<font color="#CCCCCC"> where where traffic is</font>

187
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,360
popping out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these tunnels some sort</font>

188
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,279
of device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to inspect</font>

189
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,450
what's going on that's that's one quick

190
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,950
way to address that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> many levels of</font>

191
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,100
interoperability are also an issue

192
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,680
you'll typically as a service provider

193
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know selling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this type of service</font>

194
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,540
you'll have users who already have some

195
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,839
sort of VPN implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they use</font>

196
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,819
for remote access at their site etc so

197
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,300
they'll they'll maybe want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

198
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,829
and that can be troublesome especially

199
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,979
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running you know vendor a</font>

cross vendor interoperability

202
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,410
troublesome at best many of the critical

203
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,120
features that you might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using are</font>

204
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,900
often vendor specific such as failover

205
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,090
etc products are often streamlined for

206
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,220
usability and thus extensions that

207
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,100
vendors have put in place are difficult

208
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,990
to turn off or impossible client Elaine

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,729
interoperability so vendor age client

214
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,829
isn't necessarily going to interoperate

215
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,280
with vendor B's and it's not in their

216

best interest maybe to make that work

typically a<font color="#CCCCCC"> no-brainer from a from a</font>

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,870
technical standpoint however

operationally it can be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

226
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,700
because of the disparate command

236
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,320
at the same time can also be problematic

237
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,520
so it's if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to expect that</font>

you're going to see many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

application and client interoperability

240
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:06,200
issues so some strategies in for

241
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:10,350
standard device and client combinations

242
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,000
strongly set expectations in terms of

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,590
what you're supporting its standards

level you can offer them so it's

271

important to set expectations solidly

and therefore it makes them suspect some

level of user access control is lost

347

with mantle and tunnels so some

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,640
strategies to address these security

349
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,100
concerns one is to just simply enforce a

350
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,689
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of no bifurcation or no traffic</font>

351
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,820
forking the risks are quite great

otherwise favorite clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> atlanta's a</font>

354
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,150

well-defined and can be controlled a

expect laughs as a security on the

remote end you need to be vigilant about

363
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,980
protecting your own network obviously

364
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,600
routing an addressing challenges I'm

365
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,610
sure many of you are aware of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,510
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> client Atlanta implementations work</font>

367
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:49,480
so routing and addressing issues are

368
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:53,380
typically moved with client to land

369
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,570
however would<font color="#CCCCCC"> land to land issues abound</font>

370
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,610
and I'll show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> why say you're running</font>

371
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,560
a hosting<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and you have your</font>

372
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,560
you're hosting a number of customers

373
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,889
networks or websites etc and they want

374
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:10,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">to access that stuff in order to put</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">times you'll have customers are</font>

377
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,709
utilizing the same private space or

378
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,990
seems you know whatever and you'll

379
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,720
therefore have customers coming in over

380
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:23,150
land to land sourcing from addresses in

381
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,100
common so obviously at your edge where

382
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,319
you're terminating these tunnels routing

383
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:31,550
can become problematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convert become</font>

384
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:33,710
problematic throughout your network so

385
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,129
again use of private addressing is

386
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,500
pervasive and this makes collisions

387
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,600
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network inevitable advanced</font>

388
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,330
routing techniques like policy based

389
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,879
routing source look routing are commonly

390
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,030
not feasible or available and route

391
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,340
sharing is typically undesirable this is

392
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,980
sort of a side issue it can be

393
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,199
complicated and therefore difficult to

394
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,230
control what what is going on within

395
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,690
your own network

396
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,830
if I out sharings not used obviously

397
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,809
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out some</font>

398
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,269
way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your customers to plumb the</font>

399
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:11,418
traffic within their network to the

400
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:13,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">endpoint and over to your side so this</font>

401
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:14,570
can be problematic because many of the

402
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,539
customers that you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me</font>

403
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,100
may find it difficult to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

404
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,940
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this new device sitting on my</font>

405
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,799

406
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,539
another issue with that is if they for

407
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,418
instance start redistributing routes

408
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:31,879
throughout their network for resources

409
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:34,279
on your side if there's leaking etc this

410
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:37,850
can be pretty disastrous for your

411
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:40,429
environment so good<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT there's a</font>

412
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,080
duality to NAT with ipsec and to

413
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,379
creating tunnels and providing this type

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,668
of service<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beneficial</font>

415
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:48,649
because it can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cope with these</font>

416
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,809
issues it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can create a layer of</font>

417
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:53,239
abstraction or a buffer<font color="#CCCCCC"> between you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

418
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">your customers it can simplify your own</font>

419
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,399
internal routing and it can mitigate

420
00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:01,250
customer internal IP address conflicts

421
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:03,529
and it also returns a major level of

422
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,110
control to you as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider</font>

423
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:08,600
the downsides are obviously complexity

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing all these translations to</font>

425

all these networks that can it can get

426
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,590
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> spaghetti like bi-directional</font>

427
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,969
traffic initiation with like i was

428
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,658
saying many to one that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

429
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:23,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">problematic and there's also application</font>

430
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:27,409
and compatibility issues with with

431
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">natick so here's an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

432
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:32,389

<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously very simplified but this is</font>

439
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,820
strategies again you need to provide a

440
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,529
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of documentation a lot of what I'm</font>

441
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,379
talking about as you can see is

442
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:56,779
education I consider an architecture

443
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:59,529
that protects you your critical services

444
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,820
from leaking routes on a customer end

445
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,649
build an abstraction layer to your

446
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,710
network where traffic and addressing can

447
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:08,658

compartmentalizes many of the aspects of

458
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:36,110
providing an ipsec VPN you can provide

459

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,030
defense in depth which isn't obviously

463
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:49,789
important and also be vigilant and

464
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,770
selecting a VPN product one that that

465
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,270
allows you as a service provider to do

466
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,039
many different things with many

467
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,460
different customers many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are</font>

typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed for the enterprise so</font>

469
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:05,030
that's important human factors

470
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,710
perceptions and expectations this is

471
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,039
probably one of the largest things that

472
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,650
we run into the underlying connectivity

473
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:15,530
architecture wants a IP SEC VPNs in

474
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,179
place is extracted and the traditional

475
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,280
troubleshooting techniques that a custom

476
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:21,679
might might use to understand what's

477
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,230
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wise things are going slow etc</font>

478
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,970
is can lead them astray because

479
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,960
obviously the underlying network between

480
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:32,150
them is obscured so this means education

481
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,250
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important letting these</font>

482
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,049
smaller customers who have maybe don't

483
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:40,940
have a broad<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding what's going</font>

484
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:43,940
on letting them know that when a tunnels

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,190
built the traffic obviously is or the

486
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,490
hops along the way that type of stuff is

487
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,809
extracted<font color="#CCCCCC"> from them and therefore you</font>

488
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,150
need to help them understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

489
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:57,830
address the issues where to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I'm saying is she's hot if you</font>

491
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,449
ownership conflicts are also very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

492
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:05,440
when you're doing this type of service

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:08,030
provider provisioned type of VPN

494
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore your customer relationship</font>

495
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,289

00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,090
is highly cooperative which means you

<font color="#CCCCCC">really need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very closely</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these issues performance expectations I</font>

it they're difficult to enforce

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,580
obviously because<font color="#CCCCCC"> your util a network</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your control in many</font>

ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sis and marketing</font>

people understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're trying to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">capable of doing obviously you know the</font>

513
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,430
consequences of not having educated

514
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:59,629
sales and marketing folks and also

515
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:01,610
educate yourself know<font color="#CCCCCC"> your customers so</font>

516
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,210
I think running throughout the

517
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:07,189
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you'll see education is</font>

518
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,530
one of the main issues when you're

519
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,800
providing this type of service as a host

520
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:15,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">er in our case many of the customers are</font>

521
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,379
typically doing a lot of advanced

522
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,240
networking at the smaller level

523
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,520
obviously you'll have large customers to

524
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,440
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an issue but a large</font>

525
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,940
number of the smaller customers will and

526
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,960
also setting expectations is essential

527
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,810
letting your customers know what they

528
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">can expect out of your VPN network is</font>

529
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,389
important so some conclusions again

530
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,640
large majority of the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

531
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:43,490
creating ipsec VPN<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this application</font>

532
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,580
are pretty mundane and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

533
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,480
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology related per se in</font>

534
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,320
other words you're not going to be

535
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:56,000
looking at why you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ike phase ones</font>

536
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:59,810
failing etc VPNs do not mitigate many of

537
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,640
the traditional connectivity issues they

538
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,649
they also<font color="#CCCCCC"> combine in many of the</font>

539
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,840
traditional LAN connectivity issues that

540
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,190
you would see<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the enterprise etc with</font>

541
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,020
the vagaries of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

542
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:14,030
quickly magnifies complexity external

543
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,010
issues affecting performance are common

544
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,950
and thus these expectations need to be

545
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:21,230
communicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly issues over</font>

546
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,570
ownership of configuration connectivity

547
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:26,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">and even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware are common so you need</font>

548
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:29,300
to again set the relationship let people

549
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand what your your responsibility</font>

550
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,680
is what their<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility is now your</font>

551
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,780
target customers ensure that your design

552
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,559
is flexible enough to accommodate the

553
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,720
vast majority

554
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,149
without breeding expectations in your

555
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,070
network and education should serve as

556
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:50,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the foundation of your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>
