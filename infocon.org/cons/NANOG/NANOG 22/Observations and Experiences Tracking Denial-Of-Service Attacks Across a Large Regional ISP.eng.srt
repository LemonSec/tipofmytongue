<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk to a little bit about today is</font>

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,929
the observation and experiences we've

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,448
had tracking denial service attacks

this work a compliment to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjuster</font>

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,439
so whereas the previous talk looked at a

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,448
global perspective of what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said also</font>

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
protect if you look like this is a sort

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:35,760
of snapshot of what happened with those

15

specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network ok so i just want to</font>

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,410
of what what we were shown you doing

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,140
where we came from we'll go over the

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,370
collection methodology a summary denial

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,300
service statistics we measure within

21
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,489
this network and then someone at the end

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,750
so give your project overview this is

23
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,890
work i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would call the lighthouse project</font>

I also like to thank course what's going

methodology so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do</font>

41
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,250
in a nutshell was we're trying to to

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,659
measure within a single providers is

43
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,390
particular part of network we want to

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">find out which routers were affected by</font>

45
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,130
denial service attacks when they happen

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,570
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface is on the others were</font>

47
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,640
examples of the attacks are you've heard

48
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,029
these words before many times to keep in

49

<font color="#CCCCCC">saco back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stream citroen so now I</font>

50
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,040
kind of go in a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,149
need of the stats here we're trying to

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask answer a number of different</font>

53
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,770
questions basically looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data</font>

54
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,600
how many attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> will restore on the</font>

55
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,110
providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network how much of it was</font>

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,210
inbound attacks

00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,889
down the tax<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized that you'll</font>

58
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,380
recognize that the ice cream was with me

59
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,929
and educational<font color="#CCCCCC"> base either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of you</font>

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,140
right for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for compromise in those</font>

62
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,630
pads for attack we're under how long

63
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,420
will be attacks last how big<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they</font>

64
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,710
and also lifted some of the target

65
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,510
characteristics of the attacks as well

66
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,870
so look at the names as well as the

67
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,100
target autonomous systems finally we

68
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,380
want to break their appeal at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

69
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">business of source IP address cool thing</font>

70
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,090
is it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mostly towards boosting</font>

71
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">reserves the best booth and finally how</font>

72
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,739
much bandwidth was being arrested in the

73
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,630
network as a result of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> some attack</font>

74
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:49,300
so i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at whether the IPO is</font>

75
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,890
being super serves<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attacks so for the</font>

76
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,470
fact i'm looking for a min this driven

77
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,149
the scene that is primarily over anime

78
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,580
yelled violent attacks so this again

79
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on meebo with equation with the</font>

80
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,780
fact is were<font color="#E5E5E5"> educational institutions</font>

81
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:06,010
out and for the launching pad sort of

82
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,690
speak for attacks let's see again we can

83
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,959
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PDF of attack magnitude with a</font>

84
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,310
nice key clubbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> nicely as well with</font>

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,530
the threat with the previous talk i

86
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,030
think it had anything look at here is

87
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that both the soon and</font>

88
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:22,570
remote side look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> goods typed up a</font>

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,549
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> less space than we act sumpn a</font>

90
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,010
fee-based floods and that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

91
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:30,040
happening there via the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only a simple</font>

92
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,840
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> simpson fight bugs are in the short</font>

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,780
package basically to do the attacks so

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,400
they take<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a lot less bandwidth but on</font>

95
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,750
the other guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are mostly yeah Dan's</font>

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,180
related so<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at how much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bandwidth</font>

97
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,680
is wasted there in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP so saw over</font>

98
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,230
the course of about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 months there was</font>

99
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,930
about about TMJ<font color="#CCCCCC"> four gigabytes of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sin</font>

goodbye to know about 280 pm250 I've

102
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,599
seen people and talk about something 20

103
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,670
Vivat<font color="#E5E5E5"> limonite this is doing that and</font>

104
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,078
realizes what else my isp<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not great</font>

105
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,869
message types to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the</font>

106
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,700
internet so if you if you let this

107
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,189
directly service ticket running for the

108
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,839
entire grossing movie of the trial you

109
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,608
had a gun pointed three on the kilobits

110
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,409
per second oh go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free to make this</font>

111
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:19,690
per second sort of tripling outbound at

112
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:21,639
a time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at now what in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ask</font>

113
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">you what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being attacked by the people</font>

114
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,350
who are launching from the isp as well

115
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,448
as interim of the isp we saw that most

116
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,660
of the attacks were actually in this

117
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:36,340
data set against home users either the

118

120
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,440
assess where the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> creeping down</font>

121
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,039
computers will do pretty much what you

122
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,020
expect but we can see cooperating with

123
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,150
over the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> oculus nah but to give the</font>

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,419
percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of custom attacks</font>

125
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,940
are on the rise so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

126
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,590
remaining space on your attack segment

127
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,940
if we don't see well maybe here I guess

128
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great bunch incredible</font>

129
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting of attacks but we predominantly</font>

132
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:14,129
here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they only had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one or two</font>

distribution net weld about every type

136
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:24,119
of attack is wrong so again looking at

00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,429
target autonomous systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was allowed</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show the new target arrest numbers um</font>

139
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:31,498
far from the stuff in this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

we're gonna get in trouble but<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,260
services were actually running with

197
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:03,430
targets that we don't mention attacks on

<font color="#CCCCCC">essentially technology out of value</font>

200

versus even argue about them about

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,390
little last year and if you feel free to

email me or check out page if you like

<font color="#E5E5E5">the results about the breakdown of sorts</font>

206

address who thinks because if you look

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,600
at all of the tools from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tree no</font>

208
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,730
time frame onward I'm examines<font color="#CCCCCC"> olives</font>

code as a function of English filtering

212
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,219
and so it doesn't surprise me because

213
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,460
what will happen is they'll first can

214
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:07,490
send a test would be if the full spoof

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming I'm will back off on</font>

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,320
even find the graphics it but so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

220
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">would expect here why you see this</font>

221
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,730
breakdown is because you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> english</font>

222
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,030
filters had the edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> it tries to do a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">432 and then when in fact it cannot it</font>

224
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,329
back down to its last 24 which has been

225
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,420
the standard behavior for a year and a

226
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,890
half sure so there's also a flag to a

227
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,689
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these tools to which is how do</font>

you want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this spoofing and the</font>

they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it clear one of the</font>

239
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,589
better imitate that tax on the

240
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,089
infrastructure are increasing are you

241
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding that the attached to the</font>

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,709
they

244
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,170
self defeating in the sense that it was

245
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,580
at the infrastructure from the very

246
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,099
structure of the rail infrastructure

247

248
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,520
Reservation attacked stops yeah I we

249
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,680
have no quantitative analysis of how

250
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,569
what the impact of the target service

251
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">really goes for the use for the attacks</font>

252
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,120
so stupid it's hard to know whether I

253
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,540
know the anecdotal evidence for example

254
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,800
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an attack but when basically</font>

255
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">they delayed done some reconnaissance</font>

256
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they done trace route through the</font>

257
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and they protected every single</font>

rattling updates along the path

259
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:51,170
basically and what sort of disrupted a

260
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:54,150
significant portion of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isps</font>

261
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,979
operations so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was very</font>

00:10:54,150 --> 00:11:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective and didn't down service to</font>

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,630
actually target itself proposed to as

264
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,630
was not

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,980
sorry
