1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,330
okay so thank you everybody and wow I

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:13,469
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> when everybody's listen it like</font>

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:17,460
a normal classroom anyway so I'm people

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:20,130
offered um I also want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a little</font>

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit about what's going on in our</font>

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,310
industry and then some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,710
observations and what can what I think

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:35,550
can be done or not done and and I think

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:38,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really know them we are</font>

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,169
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make an effort work and if you</font>

11
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,930
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to users that the thing they</font>

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,850
start asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> is at some point they</font>

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,140
say I wanted to work now and I want to

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">cheat and I wanted reliable and then we</font>

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,399
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address this in all sorts</font>

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,468
of ways and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and right now there is a</font>

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,829
whole industry of people trying to make

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:04,769
boxes that do things that I really don't

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:07,650
understand what they're good for and you

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,140
can actually make everything that I can

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">hear people asking for in the air in</font>

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,189
there in the space or what where we are

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,949
operating using s IP packets I just

24
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,750
don't see why we have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> around with</font>

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,280
all sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time in</font>

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,720
trying to just six the problem we ended

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,670
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a very funny scenario right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,490
where people are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all sorts</font>

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,750
of buzzwords again and for a while we we

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,539
didn't have that money to deal with but

31
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">now it's bareback and some of the people</font>

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,390
are actually trying to art market is<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,180
and we're getting to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where i</font>

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,829
saw that Clara Greg we're comparing

35
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">isolation service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providers and the top</font>

36
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,279
one they were basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were much</font>

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,589
faster than speed of light they saw a

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,350
lot of problems there so if you look at

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last line there is a so with I ATM</font>

40
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,210
and you can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what word i</font>

41
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,500
didn't put there instead of etc they all

42
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,339
look fantastic and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,020
actually make it work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> once I fought</font>

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,880
me where we're trying to got rid of

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,500
these people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying to put</font>

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,228
things on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need for IP network and</font>

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,008
make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard to operate</font>

48
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,410
unfortunately they were replaced by a

49
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,739
new free throw

50
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,240
and maybe maybe if you were to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

51
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,970
effort you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> build an effort that</font>

52
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,580
looks like this the thing in the middle

53
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,320
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I call ipv4 transport is it's</font>

54
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,350
something that just moves IP packets IP

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,420
packets could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ipv4 packets or maybe</font>

56
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,640
even ipv6 packets that's for now ipv4

57
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,929
packets and then you end up with all

58
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,369
those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people want to sell</font>

59
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,560
they call them services they call them

60
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,690
all sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is nothing</font>

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I can't figure out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

62
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,240
can put on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this transport Corps</font>

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,590
there the feature of doing it this way

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can keep your head with them</font>

65
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,120
very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the middle of the</font>

66
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,829
network X you can do at the same time

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,150
serve the function of eating the public

68
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,500
internet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the thing that</font>

69
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,480
actually makes things go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around there</font>

70
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">are also a quality of service stuff and</font>

71
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,320
there are all sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

72
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,150
let's go look at how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some of</font>

73
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using IP in the middle</font>

74
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,080
of the network and not trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,080
so complicated for the ones who doesn't

76
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,440
understand what denver duck service is

77
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's there's a company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually is</font>

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">now the local phone company Tarbuck here</font>

79
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,320
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> I asked them at one point where</font>

80
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,520
they were they were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> big about IP</font>

81
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,840
or office and I asked them where they

82
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,610
were building an ATM service and they

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,670
said well we have to feed the ducks in

84
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:33,920
general the core of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that if</font>

85
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,359
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pretty simple the core the</font>

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,179
job of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core of the never gets a new</font>

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,250
package<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you try to make the</font>

88
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,140
quarter of an effort understand what

89
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,760
every customer is asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what every</font>

90
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,730
customers need is and trying to figure

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">out what to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you</font>

92
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,010
10 de you<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 having a fairly complicated</font>

93
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,540
network configuration or you have some

94
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,630
protocols that actually does<font color="#CCCCCC"> States in</font>

95
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,370
an effort and maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can build that</font>

96
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,350
for one the customer at a time and you

97
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,520
layer them on top of each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> so every</font>

98
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,320
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new customer special</font>

99
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you configure it to verify</font>

100
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,920
that it works and it's all fine and

101
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,840
dandy but what happens over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is that</font>

102
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,488
your network gets bigger and you get new

103
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,500
boxes and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get fancy box and your</font>

104
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,350
topology changes and something breaks

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,660
and rewriting happens and and it means

106
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the network a she knows does a</font>

107
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,260
lot of performs a lot of functions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

108
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,060
are the paying customer to paying

109
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,180
customers are paying for you have to

110
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,500
retest every time

111
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,220
change to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does the</font>

112
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,470
right thing this mpls people with

113
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,870
tunnels you give them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an N</font>

114
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,060
squared problem of figuring out how

115
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,650
writing works even is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you if you</font>

116
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,449
get more circus than you physically have

117
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,479
right so you get more headaches and you

118
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:45,000
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have if you hadn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done anything</font>

119
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,320
um there's a lot of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has to be</font>

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,180
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the routing protocols we have</font>

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,409
today like b he p and r<font color="#CCCCCC"> IEPs are not</font>

122
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,940
optimal for what they're trying to do

123
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,560
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that could be</font>

124
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,990
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them are there may be some of</font>

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,550
them yes need something you but most

126
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,259
resources and all the vendors go to the

127
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Department of boss which is the people</font>

128
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,330
that don't do all sorts of things that

129
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:09,990
doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> package</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm i think</font>

130
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:13,440
that the functions that the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

131
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,780
you can all do at the edge and I said

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,789
value added value removed if you end up

133
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,630
building a perfect network and somebody

134
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:23,099
wants pay less you have to produce a

135
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,659
worse service than you had from the

136
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:26,070
beginning so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

137
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw that packet delay and delay them</font>

138
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:32,070
and do stunts there is some history

139
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,909
behind where we're right we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going the</font>

140
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,349
way we were going in the old days then

141
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:39,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">would cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

142
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,680
were working internationally if you went

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,169
into country the cost of a circuit was

144
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,090
basically a 24 by 7 phone call with

145
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,070
twenty percent off so you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

146
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,138
ways of using that circuit basically

147

over<font color="#CCCCCC"> sonet in order to make any money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

148

all but today when you can buy fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,750
cheap that is not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> funny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BAM beard</font>

150
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,550
is not an issue really so a lot of stuff

151
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,440
was built around assumptions that are no

152

works for a service provider and he said

154
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,258
well they're replacing our boxes and

161
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,979
needs to do is reliably deliver package

162
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,679
right and if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong in the</font>

we're breaking back in service again

168
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,950
and some people say oh yeah you have to

169
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an underlying optical network they</font>

away something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are pretty badass</font>

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,950
is knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the network is doing</font>

175
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,810
while the network is moving packets and

176
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,070
everything is fine today you have to be

177
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,720
able to figure out what is the network

178
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,219
doing who is talking to whom wheres

179
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,280
packets coming from where they're going

180
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,480
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is talking to one whom and why and</font>

181
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,460
try to guess what's going to happen in

182
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the future depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on where you're</font>

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things you have to do</font>

184
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,830
either traffic engineering or capacity

185
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,840
planning and capacity planning means

186
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,370
that you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write small papers or</font>

187
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,570
send out digging machine innocent and

188
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,889
you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what's</font>

189
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on because it's a circuit is</font>

190
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,940
overloaded maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the end point</font>

191
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,740
so that circuit that I see generated

192
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,419
traffic it may be smarter to put the

193
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,889
circuit in between two completely

194
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,320
different points in an effort to offload

195
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,180
it and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the restoration schemes</font>

196
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,169
you end up seeing on networks of any

197
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,850
size today are spaghetti you don't want

198
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,590
to never to reorder too many packets and

199
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,979
and you want the court to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

200
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">carry a large package I put 4470 here</font>

201
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,510
the game here is that you want the core

202
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,890
of an effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move bigger Pakistan</font>

203
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,110
Ethernet because even at is the de facto

204
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:56,070
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that UD mark to user with I</font>

205
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,930
mean eva<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this period the 4470 came</font>

206
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,729
form historical reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

207
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,560
basically started off with a CDI being

208
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,000
able to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

209
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,430
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are high speed network interfaces</font>

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,710
XPS did that or something bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

211
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">are reasons a ethernet standards and</font>

212
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,150
some of the ATM people can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9k or</font>

213
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,250
something so the trick here is you have

214
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,200
to be able to carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger package</font>

215
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,820
than you're giving it giving the user so

216
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,680
if you're giving the user 1500 bytes

217
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,800
over an Ethernet you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

218
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,130
able to wrap that into something to do

219
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,990
the stuff that people think they need so

220
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,510
if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a typical core and this</font>

221
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,700
is not this is not any particular

222
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">network providers this is numbers work I</font>

223
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,050
try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what numbers make</font>

224
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,459
sense before the cost of running and

225
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,620
operating and building and effort goes

226
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,848
through the roof and basically if you're

227
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to build the core of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

228
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is better than this the cost goes</font>

229
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,300
up or your operational impact is so

230
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,290
happy I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't basically taps or</font>

231
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">weave or lease</font>

232
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">our router in a year without getting</font>

233
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,319
outside the five miles of the

234
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">availability but if this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the criteria</font>

235
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,860
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have five minutes and</font>

236
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,570
availability on you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

237
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,839
pretty decent job using IP technology

238
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,360
and a connectionless network I don't

239
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,250
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's anything strange in there</font>

240
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,839
so I point is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have something</font>

241
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that requires a better network</font>

242
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,279
connectivity that better performance or

243
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">a TDM kind of type surveys of TDM like</font>

244
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,899
service you're better off buying a TDM

245
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,910
effort because I can't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a welded IP</font>

246
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:25,769
networks or packet networks then people

247
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:30,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you need call to service in the</font>

248
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:34,199
backbone this graph shows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> queuing</font>

250
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:39,209
is milliseconds of delay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

251
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,420
horizontal scale is loads of the circuit

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the green one is that he won so you</font>

253
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,360
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on a t1 when you start to load</font>

254
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,888
the circuit at sixty seventy eighty

255
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,029
percent you're actually introducing

256
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,470
queuing delay and it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font>

257
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:57,779
roof so if you have packets that are

258
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packets you may win by putting</font>

them before the packets are not real

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:04,949
time packets because there is an alkyl

261
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:06,870
up on cue look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> p3 circuit the</font>

262
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:09,240

263
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,510
sixty percent load<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that makes</font>

264
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,240
sense the red line is a 10 it's a 10

265
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,519

269
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,190
faster so as what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> people get</font>

270
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,660
confused about the switching delay in

271
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,310
Juarez versus queuing delay in artists

272
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,380
and they forgot that they are over

273
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,930
magnitudes much smaller than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> queuing</font>

274
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:37,110
density propagation then the speed of

this bits in<font color="#E5E5E5"> block in glass now if you</font>

276
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,089
increase the backbone circuit I still

277
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,740
kept the p1 there and you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a note III</font>

278
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">backbones work it okay you're queuing</font>

279
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,019

security of service fight prioritizing

281
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,029

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,250
eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> load and if you go to an</font>

283
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,990
OC 12 network it you actually have to

284
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,760
get up ninety percent load of the

285
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,120
circuit before it makes any sense it

286
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,760
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

287
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,980
at the no c48 network you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

288
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,660
over ninety seven percent load on your

289
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,390
backbone before you're queuing makes

290
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,860
absolutely no sense or before you're

291
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,939
killing make any sense you have to load

292
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,800
your circuit at ninety-eight percent

293
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,350
which is tricky so you're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

294
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,209
with very very is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small margin</font>

295
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,310
today everybody has an LC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 192 network</font>

296
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,630
and with a note C 192 network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

297
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,279
to load the network up to ninety nine

298
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,800
percent before you're queuing delay

299
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,360
becomes an issue and the gang of doing

300
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">Troy dq'ing and your backbone is</font>

301
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,890
basically suppose okay if your circuit

302
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,180
is overloaded yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in trouble but</font>

303
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,339
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no reason for overloading an</font>

304
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,870
effort today you can make you can make

305
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:44,170
it work that the chief facilities

306
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:45,820
available in in any way ok so the

307
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,219
background 12 the service is not really

308
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,200
needed as long as it's working then you

309
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,520
get to what the customer wants and the

310
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,760
customer they have all sorts of weird

311
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,410
the idea is what they want and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

312
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,189
you can do that at the edge it's fine if

313
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:03,189
you can find a way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them figuring out</font>

314
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,420
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn it into product we maybe we</font>

315
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,029
can learn something from the cell phone

316
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,290
people anybody I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know anybody that</font>

317
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,400
can figure out with a cell phone bill is

318
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be next month it's so</font>

319
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,819
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't know what's</font>

320
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:17,350
going on and people stood to pay anyway

321
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,490
so customer called your service is

322
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,080
something you can do at the edge right

323
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the core is out of the picture</font>

324
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:29,500
here so if you're on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribe</font>

325
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,270
link or if your ball neck it's a circuit

326
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,920
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customers maybe the t1 circuit</font>

327
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,589
then he wants to do voice over IP and he

328
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,150
also wants to do ftp transfers there's a

329
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,420
wind of putting the voice packets before

330
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,910
the type to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be transferred packets now</font>

331
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,189
it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of transport</font>

332
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,480
you're using if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ATM or mpls right T</font>

333
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,980
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a queuing problem and you have</font>

334
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,209
to figuring out how you have to figure

335
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">out how to do queuing you're queuing</font>

336
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:54,969
strategy but then you can look at the

337
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:57,279
packet and it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem of I</font>

338
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,020
have five different cues I now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

339
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,640
look at my traffic and say which packet

340
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,959
goes into both queue and there's a

341
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,420
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways of doing it but there's</font>

342
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,099
nothing like<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrapping with the bottom</font>

343
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,529
line right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where for example</font>

344
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,000
mpls phones in itself that oh you look

345
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,800
at this label and that label goes in a

346
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,120
certain queue and it gives the user the

347
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,160
veil ability to tag is

348
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,810
I guess you can have done that through

349
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,990
other means to then speak we got the

350
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,790
quality of service being save people I'm

351
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,890
too tired the quality of service thing

352
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,130
taken care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what do we need to</font>

353
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">build services to users well they asked</font>

354
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,460
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things basically they asked for</font>

355
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,920
point-to-point circuits and they asked

356
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,660
for point-to-multipoint clouds and they

357
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,310
sometimes think they need a

358
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,569
point-to-multipoint cloud where the

359
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,540
cloud actually understands the IP

360
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,610
routing has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a multiple back views and</font>

361
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two products you end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having is</font>

362
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:54,670
the public internet connection and a VPN

363
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:56,080
service now there is nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

364
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,670
you can do this lightly headers right

365
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,600
you see what you do if you instead of

366
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">using UTI is basically mpls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that using</font>

367
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,390
IP headers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just put a funny word learn</font>

368
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,060
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do is you take a</font>

369
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:13,060
layer 2 packet it could be a packet or a

370
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,500
solid frame an ATM crime and I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> al5</font>

371
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,359
only there because you really don't want

372
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,650
to take people's voice traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> or their</font>

373
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,260
circuit simulation traffic and try to

374
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,850
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet network because if</font>

375
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,800
you remember my Escalade for the court

376
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">David</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs free second playoff offers</font>

377
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,680
and nobody wants a circuit for voice

<font color="#E5E5E5">with 666 second-ranked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bully you can</font>

do framing life<font color="#E5E5E5"> tranquil multi points</font>

380
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,970
you can do IP and IP which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think which</font>

385
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,240
explain straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to an IP packet and</font>

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,459
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to have multiple</font>

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,690
circuits on that same ethernet we do the

388
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:55,270
1 QV and encapsulation feature is that

389

you everything you look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

390
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,000
people are trying to solve right now

391
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,709
there you have variations of

392
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,870
encapsulation and the method of

393
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:06,609
encapsulation doesn't really matter as

394
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:09,390
long as you can carry it when you have

395

<font color="#CCCCCC">skip those slides</font>

396
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,020
you have attitude on the i'm going to

397
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,550
show this line because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's simpler</font>

401
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,510
we just take ethernet frames and put

them in a tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun it to another</font>

405
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,069
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> do service provider selection and</font>

Transport for any layer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> service so</font>

409
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:48,330
it's going to be layer to overlay or

free overlay to instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of so if you</font>

look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> an end of this you have the</font>

an IP source destination pair and

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,790
dusting capsulation and you can do

else is just not really secure I mean

432
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,310
you have somebody plug the viola station

475
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,260
got real security so if you're on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

always encrypted the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right on the inside</font>

479
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,320
then just can run any routing protocols

480
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,360
on it tolls and now you're saying okay

481

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,450

486
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,290
is you configure that last of routers to

487

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,530
really like to push this at the edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

526
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,270
if you want to put that edge the missing

527
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,910
piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> are is a discovery protocol that</font>

528
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,290
we'd find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm VPN blockbusters</font>

529
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,120
where are the members of VPN

530
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,280
blockbusters well you can configure to

531
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,020
RP right and then there's more fruits of

532
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,790
people we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have can help us say okay</font>

533
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,320
here's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sign those messages and</font>

534
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,930
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get denial of service</font>

535
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,929
attacks and now poof you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> find all</font>

536
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:25,690
the members of this VPN and then the

537
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">outer router together with the protocols</font>

538
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,020
can actually go and build all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> word</font>

539
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">from circuits that go in between them on</font>

540
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:35,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the network the feature</font>

541
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,910
of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anybody can do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

542
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,350
would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run across the existing</font>

543
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">internets from any across multiple</font>

544
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,000
providers so I made an artist line that

545
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,239
looks like the different that shows the

546
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,130
same thing then it solves a problem that

547
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manage rudder networks</font>

548
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,990
or VPNs today that the NOC has to be

549
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,330
inside all those thousands of VPNs in

550
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,670
order to monitor the networks and in n

551
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,340
it's actually a security problem if you

552
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,580
build<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like this the the</font>

553
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,720
provider management I've forgotten are

554
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,909
the provider can be sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

555
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,590
outside because the DM said is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

556
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,240
inside of the network so if you are

557
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,800
sitting on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the outside where you</font>

558
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,050
can monitor the public performance of

559
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,490
the network for every box that is part

560
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and make sure the wide area</font>

561
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:21,090
service works fine being<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the outside</font>

562
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,090
not having to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the inside at all</font>

563
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,149
hmm

564
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:29,369
so what would happen is that you have an

565
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:31,289
RP and the top everybody reports to the

566
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,269
RP and then you will build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a table</font>

567
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:35,009
automatically and I got out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>
