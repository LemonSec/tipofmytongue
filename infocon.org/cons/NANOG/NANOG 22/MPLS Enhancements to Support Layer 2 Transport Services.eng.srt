<font color="#E5E5E5">service you're offering your customer I</font>

could create that outer tunnel in a

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,620
variety of manners one way would be to

222
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,360
use crl DP or rsvp-te to create a

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,250
I could also use LDC simply provisioning

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,110
very simply between those two end points

227

without applying any bandwidth

as opposed to the AL 5-mode we won't be

327

doing any segmentation and reassembly on

not quite support at the moment in this

and the length could be used to

341
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:06,089
designate the number of cells that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

encapsulating this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular frame</font>

343
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:15,199
take a look at the control word in

review the control word its<font color="#E5E5E5"> original</font>

345

00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:20,959
concerning the control word<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

347
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,149
because we want to include<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sequence</font>

349
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,170
been relatively difficult to do the

350
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:30,800
purpose of the sequence number is to

351
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:33,649
detect is do is to use that sequence

352
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,540
number and increment it on ingress but

353
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,029
then detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to detect out of order</font>

355
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:42,499
frame relay and ATM actually require you

356
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:45,819
to keep through sequence numbers intact

357
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:49,220
or keep sequentiality through the court

358
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:51,139
the length field is used in case you

359
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,600
want to pad if you have a particular

360
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,829

368
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:17,689
I'll talk a little bit about class of

service considerations that want to talk

370
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:22,699
in detail about class of service but

371
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:25,119
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something some interest in</font>

been<font color="#CCCCCC"> inner working for the service</font>

inverse arp as well as doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mapping</font>

between OEM cells and<font color="#E5E5E5"> LMI status</font>

404
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,620
messages there's been relatively new

405
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:55,139
interest in connecting a user perhaps

406
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,178
who's running Ethernet on one side and

407
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually frame relay on the other side I</font>

408

can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do some measure of IP interworking</font>

409
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,160
this is a very early stage and we'll see

410
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">if that's a good idea as we move forward</font>

411
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,669
finally isolated measurements we're

412

going to offer layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 services over an</font>

of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> SL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> A's and some improvements in</font>

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,720
the way we do our OEM and adding things

416
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,360
like continuity check to this service in

417
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,790
some way I want you to think of begin to

418
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,120
think of mpls as more of a service

419
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:33,840
enabling technology it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just for</font>

420
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,689
traffic engineering anymore and you see

421
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,520
how the scalability of mpls plays a role

422
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,140
here i can have far fewer number of

423
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,900

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:47,070
I've migrated my services from the core

multicast yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay my question</font>

429
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,870
does revolve around multicasts<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

430
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,570
working with a service provider not too

431
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,330
long ago who had an ATM core where they

432
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,250
had a bunch of ATM VCS connecting all

433
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,590
their core routers problem with that

434
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,240
strategy and multicast is that you do

435
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,250
all the packet replication when you

436
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,980
enter the core which means your links

437
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,620
are unnecessarily oversubscribed one can

438
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that argument is there any work in</font>

439
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,428
the MPLS community to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to address</font>

440
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,710
this problem of replication where

441
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,030
necessary rather than causing each of

442
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,040
the edges which is to do the pack of

443
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:33,220
replication and over subscribe to core

444
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,930
I'm not aware of any work my expertise

445
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,740
is not in multicast excellent i'm not

446
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:40,960
aware of any work in mpls to do that and

447
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,960
that's worrisome if mpls isn't

448
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,020
architected to support dancer well to me

449
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,930
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples is we would do mpls</font>

450
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,720
and IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they'll coexist for some</font>

451
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,760
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do multicast most core</font>

452
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,370
devices some of the largest core routers

453
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,379
support both mpls and IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd imagine you</font>

454
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,760
could use mpls tunnels for certain

455
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,340
service applications point-to-point

456
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,890
applications and then use regular IP

457
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,419
forwarding for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reverse path</font>

458
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,970
forwarding algorithms and tim spahr

459
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,190
smote sparsely operating but doesn't

460
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that reduce your ability to do traffic</font>

461
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,500
engineering in that situation traffic

462
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,080
engineering for multi Gary for them for

463
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,640
the IP services isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a it doesn't</font>

464
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,240
mess with me one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advantages of</font>

465
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,590
mpls well you have you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some control</font>

466
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,240
well I want don't talk too much about

467
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,280
traffic engineering applications because

468
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,380
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people right that could do</font>

469
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,050
that but you have some flexibility here

470
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can use just like controlling things</font>

471
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,190
like administrative distance cisco has

472
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,410
administrative distance command juniper

473
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:45,400
call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> preferences another question</font>

474
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,320
here yeah so how many readers in a

475
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,570
relatively large network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

476
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,070
convert over to understanding mpls in

477
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,899
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do these services at the edge</font>

478
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,919
compared to what Peter lost Berg was

479
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,450
talking about yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

480

481
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">theatre lost bird talked about yesterday</font>

482
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,020
and I understand its presentation he was

483
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:07,360
advocating using IP tunnels something he

484
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,629
called we call UTI which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

485
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,719
familiar with certainly this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

486
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">alternative to doing something like that</font>

487
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,850
this what I've shown here already<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

488
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,230
very complicated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LDP segment we're</font>

489
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,169
not doing a traffic engineering there's

490
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:26,140
no new routing protocols to learn LDC

491
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:28,030
itself is a very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple to do a</font>

492
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,100
layer 2 service using this mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

493
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,740
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to learn any thing like</font>

494
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,889
bgp if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not providing a layer 2</font>

495
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,600
service so hopefully it's easy to

496
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,190
understand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides a simple</font>

497
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,870
tunneling mechanism with all the

498
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,870
complexity of doing traffic engineering

499
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,949
that answer mr. question there okay okay

500
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you</font>
