00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,220
hi my name is Bill Manning and that

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,770
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks out of focus to me even from</font>

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,610
up here I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,820
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 addressing I've been involved</font>

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it for a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while and I'm going</font>

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pass on some observations about ipv6</font>

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and how it might be considered because</font>

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,080
in a migration standpoint that's one of

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,269
the things that people talk about is

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:33,510
that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be coexistence between</font>

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:35,040
ipv6 and our friend ipv4 so ipv6 is an

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,379
awful lot like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blind man and the</font>

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,269
elephant you can grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from one place</font>

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,430
it looks horribly different than if you

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,219
grab it somewhere else we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">look a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of some of the history</font>

17
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:51,329
behind how the addressing structure has

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,210
evolved and hint at the fact that it's

19
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,770
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not finished look at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,160
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are happening actively</font>

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,170
inside the IETF and then if you actually

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,289
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at how somebody does this</font>

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:09,619
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people have ever touched ipv6</font>

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,619
before are you happy

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,220
would you be<font color="#E5E5E5"> half on my mind we'll get</font>

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,030
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you a little</font>

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of how we map in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS basically</font>

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,330
the pointers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really sort of</font>

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,490
useful to have the map<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you have</font>

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,880
so much to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then look at</font>

31
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,649
some tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are available some</font>

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that still need to be done and</font>

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,570
then some possible ways forward before

34
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:39,750
ipv6 can truly be integrated into real

35
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:44,089
systems as opposed to academic and

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:47,010
experimental ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh when I get done</font>

37
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,479
with my sort of overview then the

38
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,510
caricato will come up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipv6 as deployed in a number of exchange</font>

40
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:59,900
points which is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting</font>

41
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:02,840
place to start ipv6 really started as a

42
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,490
huge number of bits and there was some

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,500
question about how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure that</font>

44
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:14,700
so that it's useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to use</font>

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:16,739
and the iono came up with in conjunction

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,079
with some of the addressing architecture

47
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,850
guys something that said well if we

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,980
start off with this bit pattern f5 and

49
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,840
then you have some computation you

50
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,670
basically take your autonomy system

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,650
number and you mush it around a little

52
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,089
bit and stick it in these bits and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

53
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,400
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it's yours to experiment</font>

54
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,239
with that's a good way for people to

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,299
sort of bootstrap ipv6 and that work

56
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,170
fairly well for a little while for

57
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:44,670
people to actually get some

58
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,109
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how this should work</font>

59
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,880
and they said well wait a minute we

60
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:53,840
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the structure of</font>

61
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:56,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">the addressing headers and approximately</font>

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">15 months later they came out with a new</font>

63
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,269
structure and you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you see</font>

64
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,100
ipv6 these days I don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

65
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you'll see much f5 stuff running</font>

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:11,310
around anymore but you'll see six bone

67
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,780
stuff is very prevalent the first set of

68
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">bits is three FF II</font>

69
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:17,959
shortly after that they said well okay

70
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,969
this is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is for</font>

71
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,950
experimentation you still have to apply

72
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:27,260
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF next generation</font>

73
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,920
transitions working group chair to get a

74
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,328
prefix under the six phone I said well

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,369
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really should get the regional</font>

76
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,079
registries involved because that's

77
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,750
really where production stuff is going

78
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:41,569
to happen and so they carved up things

79
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,269
called in the format prefix in the TL a

80
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,388
private up these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> called top-level</font>

81
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:50,569
aggregators one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> is reserved for</font>

82
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:54,139
transition purposes starts as<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

83
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand two and six to four and they</font>

84
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,389
also carved out space for the various

85
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:01,879
regional registries in the 2001 colon

86
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero part and what's under discussion</font>

87
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,518
now is shifting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

88
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,849
passing off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the regional registries</font>

89
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:15,579
how they can better allocate space left

90
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:18,259
of the 64<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually lefty 235 so</font>

91
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:21,199
addressing structures like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 own</font>

92
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:24,500
before it took longer we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from post</font>

93
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,840
to network to class full to class lists

94
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,460
in v6 we're going through some of the

95
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,770
same types of things it's already gone

96
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,570
through several iterations so in some

97
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,370
sense it's relatively cooked people are

98
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,960
starting to develop products and

99
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,960
services based on this structure

100
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:44,120
shifting focus a little bit from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

101
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,400
actual format of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses to how do</font>

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,270
you actually encode these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:54,560
getting old I can remember 32 bits most

104
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,389
of the time I cannot remember 128 bits

105
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,259
unless you compress a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

106
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:01,490
zeros in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and so contrary to a</font>

107
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:04,490
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine who said there were no</font>

108
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,099
there were no urgent vns problems with

109
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,530
ipv6 there might in fact be because if

110
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:14,060
you can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the literal address</font>

111
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:15,650
you might have to remember the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name so</font>

112
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,479
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF they came up with some</font>

113
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,698
new resource record types in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS to</font>

114
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,430
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of track this stuff and they also</font>

115
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,440
sort of promoting native ipv6 transport

116
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,890
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch briefly on one of the</font>

117
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,420
areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of concern with that right</font>

118
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,900
so we have new resource record types we

119
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,660
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> forwards being the IETF and</font>

120
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,909
letting a thousand flowers<font color="#E5E5E5"> bloom they</font>

121
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,280
said well we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give it our</font>

122
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,670
best shot it's four times<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger than an</font>

123
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:48,380
a record we're going to call it a quad a

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:52,310
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around for a long time 96 is</font>

125
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,930
that right Paul something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

126
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really support remembering</font>

127
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,400
easily and that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the promises</font>

128
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:01,160
that v6 give you is that you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

129
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,659
divorce topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the end systems can</font>

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,120
sort of move around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can change</font>

131
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,210
providers you really don't care too much

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,390
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your actual IP address is</font>

133
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,780
because it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change quantities are</font>

134
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:16,669
operationally for those of us that use

135
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">Emacs and VI for editing our zone files</font>

136
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:24,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">its operationally intuitive it's just</font>

137
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:26,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">before times bigger again over the</font>

138
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">course of some experimentation they said</font>

139
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,780
well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need something that</font>

140
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,930
supports better remembering so they came

141
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,299
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an alternative thing called a 6</font>

142
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:40,940

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of complex because you can't</font>

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the record and say that's</font>

the complete record you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say you have</font>

148
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,590
the potential of saying I can look at a

149
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,830
record and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a piece of it and</font>

150
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,479
there's a chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have to follow</font>

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,640
additional section processing that's a

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit hard for operations people to</font>

154
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,919
comprehend sometimes from the reverse

perspective you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> email not a whole</font>

158

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:36,460
to emerge that will help fix or help you

164
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,460
manipulate and maintain ipv6 records

165
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:48,790
unfortunately anybody remember the is is

<font color="#E5E5E5">ospf</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wars which one is the best igp well</font>

168
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:58,159
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two types of ipv6 records that</font>

perform the same function<font color="#E5E5E5"> quad a & a 6</font>

170
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:08,390
and there is some question about which

171
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,920
one actually gets used in particularly

172
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,289
constrained arenas and this actually

173
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">raised them sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the important piece</font>

174
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,640
here which is how do we deploy this in

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS in particular the DNS root</font>

176
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:24,590
context do we add a quoi days or a sixes

177
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:26,750
can we put v6 transport on so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

178
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,030
there how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually install this</font>

179
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,330
stuff question that was raised about

180
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,390
which one actually created a tremendous

181
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:39,410
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussion inside the ITF SD</font>

182
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,780
do we kill one and if so which one and

183
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:46,100
why and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

184
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:48,079
answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so a couple of things</font>

185
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,910
about doing a stepwise refinement doing

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,860
some staging doing some merging of these

187
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,280
types of ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually see which one</font>

188
00:08:51,860 --> 00:09:00,650
actually works best on a good day I like

189
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,900
a six on a bad day of like what a inside

190
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,209
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS itself and I for those of you</font>

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,810
sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back there are plenty of</font>

192
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:12,050
seats in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front to actually read this</font>

193
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,880
what you have is you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first few</font>

194
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,479
bits are called the format prefix and

195
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's 16 bits and then you have the</font>

196
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">TLA or the top-level aggregator and you</font>

197
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,300
have the next level aggregator and then

198
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,079
you have the secondary level aggregator

199
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,390
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your basically your top 64 bits</font>

200
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,500
some of those fields are reserved and

201
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:36,260
then you have the bottom 64 and so for

202
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,350
this particular structure starting at

203
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:43,310
the bottom we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have three FF II colon</font>

204
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,580
colon slash 16 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the format prefix</font>

205
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:49,119
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregator for the six</font>

206
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:51,640
it's a perfectly legitimate in current

207
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,700
addressing parlance ipv6 space to work

208
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,270
from we have the next level aggregator

209
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:04,180
right here which is three<font color="#CCCCCC"> FFP colon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

211
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,670
exchanges that's where its marked at and

212
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,410
then we parse out things to various

213
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,079
exchange points through one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Los</font>

216
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,860

can sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> underneath better in this type</font>

of arena it makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to</font>

219
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,480
actually type all this stuff in so you

220
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,239
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to use labels</font>

221
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,920
instead of numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that inside the DNS</font>

222
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,520
you have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and it's appropriate</font>

223
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,400
this is in fact copied out of our DNS

224
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,100
zone file so that it helps you when you

225
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,360
actually edit the file to figure out

226
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,460
what's where as things change you'll

227
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,610
find that perhaps those reserved bits

228
00:10:51,460 --> 00:11:01,360
and maybe the format prefixes may change

229
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:04,450
their function as we evolve ipv6 as i

230
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,820
talked about supports this idea of

231
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,680
autore numbering so you basically can

232
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,250
take some of those top parts of the

233
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:15,699
prefix some of this stuff up here on

234
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,290
this on this side and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

235
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,520
that you can put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> duplicate sets of</font>

236
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,400
entries you can say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got one</font>

237
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,260
I've got service from I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bills</font>

I

241
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,699
and what you can do is you can leave the

242
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,459
bottom half of your address intact and

243
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:42,279
you simply remap to pick the exit the

244
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:44,559
egress point the problem with that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

can solve that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some other way bgp</font>

pier with the neighbors IP address and

resolvers a basically point basically

261
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,569
the problem is with anywhere IP

addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> any application which depends</font>

264
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,209
have problems so while ipv6 looks like

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:39,519
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good operationally it's</font>

266
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:41,439
still got a little ways to go from a

267
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,449
registry perspective and from how people

268
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:46,599
actually do anybody here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with a</font>

269
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:51,849
registry for getting numbers nobody does

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,589
oh right let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this done registries</font>

271
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,290
tend to want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document your use of</font>

272
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:58,929
address space and you can either do

273
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,120
things like Swift which i think is evil

274
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:04,269
incarnate or you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use our who is</font>

275
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,179
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only slightly slightly better a</font>

276
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:11,110
couple of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago some folks at is I</font>

277
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:13,809
put ipv6 support into our who is so it
