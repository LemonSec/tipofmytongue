00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,939
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I figured because i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> giving a talk</font>

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,200
on wireless that's why the m plot the pc

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,210
and it doesn't work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,079
about ospf for broadband wireless campus

scottsdale road path of town across the

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,570
river and then you come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> asu is a</font>

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,970
fairly big campus in terms of number of

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,430
students about 40,000 students<font color="#E5E5E5"> just on</font>

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:35,760
campus so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to go a lot of stuff</font>

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">on campus network that about two months</font>

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,309
ago the vice president for computing on

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,969
canvas call me to see if I be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font>

14
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">give a talk here so I figure we'll talk</font>

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,020
about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wireless hamper spectrum at</font>

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,890
ASU oh well I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is</font>

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,320
applications for wireless broadband

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,469
campus networks why we need the wireless

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,180
campus back for backbone and then in

20
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,640
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go while as we need to figure</font>

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,979
out whether we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use optical free space</font>

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,729
technology or radiofrequency technology

23
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,619
and i'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about ospf and how we're</font>

24
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,869
modifying ospf for broadband wireless

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:19,549
network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll talk a little bit about</font>

26
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:21,299
ongoing embedded system prototype now

27
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,590
application of broadband wireless

28
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,320
backbone ASU has quite a few large data

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">centers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> storage facility all over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,339
campus it's a urban campus very compact

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,299
but yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> these data centers are</font>

32
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,460
distributed in many different buildings

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,530
so there's a growing need for multimedia

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,979
educational material storage and

35
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:48,630
retrieval education online so they

36
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:52,710
there's a large digital video libraries

37
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose a lot of the educational</font>

38
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,520
material need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> distributed to</font>

39
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,710
different buildings as well as two

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,240
different companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the valley</font>

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:06,479
such as Intel Motorola and so we have

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,019
also massive data stores there's a mass

43
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,540
probe that project with NASA in the

44
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,160
future that may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> typing terabytes of</font>

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,859
data

46
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,210
campus there's also research effort on

47
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,730
3d modeling that's our<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff there could</font>

48
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:26,200
be a wireless local<font color="#E5E5E5"> area network hotspot</font>

49
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess here is the hot spot by itself</font>

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,000
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> also there's a need for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> portable</font>

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,640
wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> multimedia booths two example</font>

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,580
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we run student elections and things</font>

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,489
of that sort then the students<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,500
the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to pull the wire</font>

55
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:45,950
literally over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

56
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,980
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> students over each other so so</font>

57
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,780
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of applications I would</font>

58
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,049
see basically it's not just a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

59
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,180
access the internet but for educational

60
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,420
purposes a streaming video from one

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,130
building to another building so there's

62
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,519
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of storage area network</font>

63
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:09,200
applications going on in campus now um

64
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,180
so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to twenty another</font>

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,910
building to talk to the vice pres de

66
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,410
vice provost for computing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> show me</font>

67
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,950
the network diagram that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

68
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:21,430
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively it's a multiple</font>

69
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,649
layer of happens both gigabit ethernet

70
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,680
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> i used to work for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> veil</font>

71
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,959
system I thought in these 70s of the

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,790
early 80s we got rid of this

73
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:37,880
hierarchical network the telephone

74
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,820
network basically and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I found out</font>

75
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,100
in the two thousand the IP network is

76
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,560
actively a hub-and-spoke network on

77
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,320
campus it's a three-level hierarchical

78
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,810
network and we'll show you later now ASU

79
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,880
has three major campuses one the<font color="#CCCCCC"> East</font>

80
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,820
enters the central campus is where Moses

81
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,519
students 40,000 students are and the

82
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,070
ease and<font color="#E5E5E5"> West campuses have about 10,000</font>

83
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,890
students each we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few isolated off</font>

84
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,370
campus buildings and so what we want is

85
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,859
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scalable and reconfigurable</font>

86
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,860
networks hopefully also a portable

87
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">network the solution what we do have</font>

88
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,780
wireless broadband we have district<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,029
what to do also distributed storage area

90
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,460
network and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

91
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,210
is basically making a reliable or SPF

92
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:30,289
protocol

93
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:32,359
wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> links</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now let's</font>

94
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at the SU campus backbone and you</font>

95
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,860
see why is a higher highly hierarchical

96
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:43,818
network effectively is at least three

97
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">levels of hierarchy maybe four at the</font>

98
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">very low layer you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have all these</font>

99
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,800
switches layer 2 switches on each of the

100
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">floor of the building and each floor</font>

101
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:59,210
would have effectively a building

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,440
network which you see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the left hand</font>

103
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,729
side of building one building<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,430
building and each would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> disowned</font>

105
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:12,940
router that connects to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the</font>

106
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:15,320
six major hubs on campus such as the

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,560
the hierarchy you have the effectively

switch by a 1 gigabit per second

118
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,840
ethernet link and then they are linked

00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:01,250
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also you know something's going</font>

self and enough arizona state university

124
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:09,440
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> north so you think about it if</font>

125
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:15,109
actively you have three levels of

126
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:18,229
hierarchy there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sadie your five</font>

127
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,120
major hubs there and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hub's are</font>

128
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:22,400
connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main hub at 0 main</font>

129
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,909
building now the old main building is a

130
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,789
historically<font color="#E5E5E5"> protected buildings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:33,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that they lost the floor plans for</font>

132
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:35,300
the building so so they are it's a I

133
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,849
guess the computing center started there

134
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,709
so

135
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:39,419
you know that's why they're still<font color="#CCCCCC"> housed</font>

136
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:42,719
there even though is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very old</font>

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:44,669

138
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,860

the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh main hub all right so now</font>

145
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:13,889
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this whole architecture</font>

146
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:17,128
here is strictly hierarchical all

147
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:21,240
traffic goes oh mein gott redistributed

148
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:23,789
down so what we are talking about here

149
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,179
is basically we with film in a jug band

150
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:32,159
wireless network at least connecting the

151
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:36,419
five hubs at the top that is a partially

152
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:38,550
mesh network we will start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

153
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:41,938
basically a mesh<font color="#CCCCCC"> network for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second</font>

154
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,219
to your hubs and then at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very bottom</font>

155
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,589
where you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> buildings I think it</font>

156
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:48,539
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good to use a mesh network so</font>

157
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:52,139
the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> year knows which are</font>

158
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,089
essentially the buildings on campus it

159
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,459
could be a relay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network for these</font>

160
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:58,709
buildings so that one building would

161
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:01,589
serve<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a relay a wireless relay for</font>

162
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,659
another building so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of</font>

163
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,929
topology we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it's in a</font>

164
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:09,990
junk network the<font color="#CCCCCC"> University allow us to</font>

165
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:13,529
pluck these wireless cut into the

166
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,769
gigabit ethernet switch and hopefully if

167
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:21,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">they trust us later on we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run the you</font>

168
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:23,159
know will merge the two network now

169
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:26,490
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about mash Network here</font>

170
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:29,639
and even though ESU is not very big

171
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,740
tempest I mean each side is about a mile

172
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,990
of class but yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have such a</font>

173
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,759
hierarchical network the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

174
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,068
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's largely prompted by the</font>

175
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,959
fact that you know what's obviously the

176
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:42,539
ethernet everybody taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> we take it</font>

177
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:46,380
easy met as a hub and connecting all the

178
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:49,170
other buildings to it communication is

179
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:55,260
expensive in in the sense that

180
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:57,149
it is it in terms of management it's

181
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,100
very hard to follow imagine networks but

182
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,889
once you put a wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> link in there is</font>

183
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,540
still easy to form a match so we're

184
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,540
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about canceling mesh network on</font>

185
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,099
the top there we could have the five

186
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:12,300
major hubs they are being connected each

187
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,740
by at least two wireless length these

188
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,529
are point-to-point links going out

189
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,139
through the different buildings<font color="#E5E5E5"> if some</font>

190
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:22,800
may have three or four things going out

191
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:28,139
and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating at one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gigabits</font>

192
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:31,170
per second now just getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

193
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,639
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technology side we look at</font>

194
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,410
whether we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> using optical</font>

195
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,139
technology or we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should use radio</font>

196
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,899
technology and the advantages the optics

197
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,209
there's no spectrum licensing required

198
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,180
there's no multiple paths problem you

199
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:47,939
need point-to-point direct line of sight

200
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:53,040
the transceivers are cheaper is high

201
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,630
speeds and you can also<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the WDM you</font>

202
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,610
have excellent channel isolation they

203
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,010
don't interfere with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other there's</font>

204
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,779
some security that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can achieve by</font>

205
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,279
optics because you have to get into line

206
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">up slightly know that in the scepter</font>

207
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,779
signal now the advantages of radio

208
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">line-of-sight sometimes is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not mandatory</font>

209
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,980
but for the purpose of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this class when</font>

210
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,130
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about right here is the line of</font>

211
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,390
sight primarily it can achieve longer

212
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:20,040
distances it's more weather resistant

213
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,569
you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free space objects</font>

214
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,349
we've actively dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you out if</font>

215
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:31,079
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fog or mist that's the worst</font>

216
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:34,019
rain is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still probably ok but in Arizona</font>

217
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,790
we don't bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but still you have a</font>

218
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,440
problem which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mysterious</font>

219
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,689
scintillation because of the hot

220
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,870
temperature and that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font>

221
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,329
across them<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says less background</font>

222
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:50,519
noise and radio is easier the point is

223
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:52,888
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saved once so we actually look at</font>

224
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,250
these two technologies and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

225
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">those actually those the laser links and</font>

226
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,370
also the radio length but when come to

227
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,270
radio link you need to worry about the

228
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:06,400
spectrum available so we look at it and

229
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:10,720
we chosen one frequency band that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

230
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 57 to 64 gigahertz and that's</font>

231
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,230
extremely high frequency you know you're

232
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,850
80 to point 11 years 2.4 gigahertz so

233
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,500
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 times higher speed now</font>

234
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,220
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that frequency band is totally</font>

235
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,750
unlicensed 57 to 64 gigahertz<font color="#E5E5E5"> got seven</font>

236
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,110
giggle has a friend with it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> doin</font>

237
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,060
license but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with that is</font>

238
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular band you can't go</font>

239
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,560
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long distance you can kill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

240
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">kilometer and that's about it ok but</font>

241
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">folks our campus a kilometer is really</font>

242
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:44,529
almost reaching enough from enough to

243
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:48,400
sell part of the campus<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we're</font>

244
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">using that and that a band is so wide</font>

245
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,140
that we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very inefficiently</font>

246
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,560
perfect in terms of bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiency</font>

247
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:59,860
as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> politician see all right so</font>

248
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,569
we can go optical we do the

249
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,080
experimentation with the wireless laser

250
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">beamed network collimating it and</font>

251
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:13,360
focusing it and trying to look at what

252
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:15,400
sort of exactly it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has on us so all</font>

253
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,890
right so the campus wireless campus

254
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">network there somewhere opposed to go</font>

255
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:23,709
wireless one is you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the LMDS you</font>

256
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,410
know wireless adsl technology basically

257
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,300
wireless local loop technology it's not

258
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">a type of network technology and is</font>

259
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,410
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sub architecture a lot of the</font>

260
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">vinyl solution these days still employ a</font>

261
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,800
hub sort of architecture like therapy

262
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,040
it's a shared bandwidth and a lot of

263
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">people may talk about anything wireless</font>

264
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,349
network and they are effectively using

265
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:50,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanna stick of the ethernet and even</font>

266
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,870
though it can in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this advertiser's 1</font>

267
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,779
Giga discuss again<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet you typically get</font>

268
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:58,270
about 20 meters per second coming it's a

269
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:01,060
local exchange carrier model dsl over

270
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,860
ATM now what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are proposing is</font>

271
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,689
basically the total totally wireless

272
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,699
spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

273
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:10,279
we don't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it as local the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mesh</font>

274
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:13,359
architecture that was interesting is

275
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,439
that you have multiple parallel pathway

276
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,910
providing a tremendous amount of

277
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">redundancy what we try to do is that</font>

278
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">defies hubs not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top including the</font>

279
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">top-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hub that we connected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to each</font>

280
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,350
other to a duel rain so each of the

281
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,110
building with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past two lasers or two</font>

282
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours link pointing to other two</font>

283
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:36,050
buildings and it is a bi-directional

284
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,170
ring and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a you know to</font>

285
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:42,349
pathway at least it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet model</font>

286
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:46,279
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually are looking at not</font>

287
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:49,339
just tcp / IP but we look at one time

288
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,899
your application is cussing largely

289
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:53,779
because we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about video retrieve</font>

290
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,930
old as ourselves so also there's a lot

291
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,209
of data center applications there and

292
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:01,969
lately there have been a lot of talk on

293
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:03,979
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I study protocol which</font>

294
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,370
effectively have discussed running over

295
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,079
tcp / IP there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of debate about</font>

296
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,920
whether you should have scarcely over

297
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:17,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP because pzt reaction time is a lot</font>

298
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,399
lower slower than discussing itself so

299
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,850
we basically in a prototype we have

300
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:26,420
Scotty of IT which is not taking the

301
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,310
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's got the over tcp / IP we</font>

302
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:33,110
look at fibre channel also because fibre

303
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:35,569
channel is a very reliable protocol in a

304
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:39,250
sense we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking at five alleged</font>

305
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:43,269
cyber channel so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 days p and</font>

306
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:46,910
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PPP also over IP network</font>

307
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:48,350
now the key challenges we have your face

308
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,250
is basically the optical length of

309
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:55,130
propagation is a problem in full weather

310
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,259
pointing is also a problem so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

311
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:00,170
to spread the email a bit power budget I

312
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:02,329
safety<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the data links we have</font>

313
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,769
linked failure no failure traffic

314
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:08,779
measurements quality of service control

315
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:11,180
network routing and routing IP switching

317
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,400
domain management and all that stuff

318
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:20,260
system analysis how does all these

319
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,970
different interfaces like stuffy and

320
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet how do they work together</font>

321
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,650
multiple political divides<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

322
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,150
configurations let's ask them so we're

323
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,610
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it from a storage area</font>

324
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,170
network point of view basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

325
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,910
like a storage area network<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

326
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">distributed long for the entire campus</font>

327
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:44,270
so we talk about mesh network is a fetch

328
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,150
our network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ling of the network</font>

329
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,439
they become inoperative at any time you

330
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,840
know maybe there's a pitcher in flying

331
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,110
overhead with droppings that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not step</font>

332
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,960
so you need to leave out when the length

333
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:01,130
is being blocked and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i talked about</font>

334
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:03,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">milliseconds sort of response time so</font>

335
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:07,880
you have to we're out within maybe a few

336
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:09,470
milliseconds it's a very light rail

337
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,320
network the failure of single links<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

338
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,420
not prohibit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message delivery now</font>

339
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,040
this sort of network is getting close to

340
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,760
what is known as the ad hoc<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

341
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,349
routing protocol except these notes are

342
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,580
could be portable<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are not</font>

343
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,110
mobile you could be plotting them to a

344
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,550
information booth and you know but it's

345
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,470
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

346
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,750
are riding around in trucks and things

347
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,300
of that sort so it's a very fragile

348
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,250
network we look at the different

349
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,800
protocol there are a lot of hot network

350
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:44,440
protocol out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

351
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:46,729
chose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use ospf in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internal tation</font>

352
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,510
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that is how do you make</font>

353
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:55,400
ospf really operate as if you are in and

354
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:56,900
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot network environment so you</font>

355
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,660
can have different kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failure</font>

356
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:04,129
router azalea<font color="#E5E5E5"> lengths area and so on now</font>

357
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:08,329
the protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> for wireless optical and</font>

358
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:11,089
not hot network we look at link state

359
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:14,089
monitoring we provision quality of

360
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:16,119
service we have rapid yes distributor

361
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,589
rerouting upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> link and no failure</font>

362
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,290
resource discovery and management and

363
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:25,940
multiple protocol adaptations now last

364
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:28,470
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the use of ospf here what is</font>

365
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,289
the link go up and down very quickly

366
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that it go down and</font>

367
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:34,379
you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Detective leg has</font>

368
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">gone down without two or three</font>

369
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:41,400
milliseconds and you do rerouting right

370
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:43,470
away and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link go back up you</font>

371
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,960
need to maybe route back to original

372
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,360
route so there are several way to do it

373
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,350
one is you can look at the HP EFI you

374
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,490
know if the local lingo down you can

375
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,918
locally trigger a route we computation

376
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:01,890
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty fast but you know most of</font>

377
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">time the delay is caused by the time</font>

378
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes to detector length has</font>

379
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,080
gone down so you have to get all the

380
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,549
information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link layer you can</font>

381
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,370
get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way up to about 10</font>

382
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">milliseconds even if you figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out we</font>

383
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,620
computation locally that doesn't take a

384
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,530
whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time but the problem is</font>

385
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you have the link state</font>

386
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,350
information public data throughout the

387
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,239
whole network that would take quite a

388
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:33,600
while in<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> computers you</font>

393
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">obscene serious problem what we chose to</font>

394
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:51,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that we pre compute the alternative</font>

395
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:53,879
pathway they effectively you know look

396
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">at all the scenario where your outgoing</font>

397
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,140
link has gone down and then computed not

398
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,909
just the shortest path tree but also the

399
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,080
shortest path tree if this link i<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent</font>

400
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:07,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">down and so on so we saw all that route</font>

401
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,428
information in case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> links idea we</font>

402
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:13,830
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a layer 2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telling us very</font>

quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the link has gone down and</font>

404
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:21,360
therefore you need to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the precum to</font>

tip<font color="#CCCCCC"> precomputed alternative route now</font>

406
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:28,949
they're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue that the lengths</font>

407
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,960
themselves only know about the link has

408
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,730
gone down locally and if you have to

409
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,320
react<font color="#E5E5E5"> within two or three million second</font>

410
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,789
you need to worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the fact that</font>

411
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,309
even though you have computer

alternative route

413
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:43,639
to your destination the other note

414
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:45,769
effectively will create loops for you

415
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:46,969
one very simple network would be the

416
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:52,009
ring network that we talked about

417
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:54,100
connecting the size hubs<font color="#E5E5E5"> you detect a</font>

down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other part of the ring the</font>

421
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:05,330
other guys still think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fastest</font>

422
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:06,969
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to go counterclockwise and it</font>

423
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,269
send it back to you in fact you gather

424
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:13,340
basically a loop and that was the

425
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:17,360
problem pointed out by one of the

426
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:20,119
speaker yesterday so we think about it

427
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,469
and we thought you know if you are

428
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with a dissenter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more reliable it's very</font>

431
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,860
interesting to talk if they pointed out

432
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:34,369
three kinds of bucks you have in the ice

433
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:40,969
cream outing that cost package jitter

434
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:44,959
and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mistakes and so all</font>

435
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,759
right so what we are the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

436
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">are looking at is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the bottom is it</font>

437
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:52,190
possible really to retain much of ospf

438
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,990
distributed computation yet able to

439
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:59,360
route correctly when the length node

440
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:00,740
fails<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so so how do we do it we</font>

441
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought about it for a while and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

442
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,049
the way we figure out at the best to

443
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:08,779
really route correctly during the time

444
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:11,690
of convergence will be the use IP

445
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:13,940
encapsulation so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is where this</font>

446
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">is simple I mean in a lot of ad hoc</font>

447
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">network routing what they do typically</font>

448
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,230
is that they do socializing and that's

449
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:25,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the most popular Sodom and hot</font>

450
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:28,869
network protocol you have nowadays how

451
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:31,789
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mix source routing with OS da</font>

452
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:33,110
that's the question we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

453
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,259
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create really a source routing</font>

454
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:40,008
protocol running parallel to West yeah

455
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:43,369
so what we do is we try to pull ospf

456
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:45,710
into thinking is doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> OSTs that in fact</font>

457
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">is our source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routing protocol so the</font>

458
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea is very simple which is basically</font>

459
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,340
IP packet and cat

460
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:58,600
too late multiple times the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route is</font>

461
00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:02,199
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively you encapsulate the</font>

462
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:06,010
packet pointing to the next hop in your

463
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,840
in your pathway so by doing multiple

464
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:12,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">encapsulation effectively you're doing</font>

465
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the answer is yes</font>

466
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,620
multiple paths ospf<font color="#E5E5E5"> is IP encapsulations</font>

467
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:21,520
or source routing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> note drug</font>

468
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:24,040
counseling state infrequently each note

469
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,120
compute multiple paths contingent on

470
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:31,629
fault and qos multiple IDs of us

471
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,729
assignments and use of ID encapsulation

472
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:38,100
the forward packet along<font color="#CCCCCC"> precomputed</font>

473
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:40,780
pathways so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prototypes</font>

474
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,550
over several platform we started with

475
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,450
the up<font color="#E5E5E5"> net to just detest out the</font>

476
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:49,990
concepts and then we are right now doing

477
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:53,490
a pizza box software out of detective

478
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:57,610
Lee is an edge router is all based on IP

479
00:22:53,490 --> 00:23:01,390
we are doing both the free space laser

480
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:04,000
length at 850 nanometer running above

481
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">one gigabit per second so testing or</font>

482
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,910
lengthen see how much power is required

483
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:14,560
so on we are also looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> midi meter</font>

484
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:16,870
wave radio length frequency at 57 to 64

485
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,870
gigahertz and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> one Gina bits per</font>

486
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:22,620
second it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied both indoor and</font>

487
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:27,159
outdoor so<font color="#CCCCCC"> these whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is really to</font>

488
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,780
break this paradigm or habit of farming

489
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,480
hierarchical network so you're putting

490
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:35,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these edge routers to start with you</font>

491
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,630
put them at the top level hierarchy the

492
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,669
second to five major hubs there and then

493
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,170
eventually you move it down to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

494
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,270
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> buildings themselves so that</font>

495
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:47,410
they themselves can form a mesh network

496
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:49,030
or relay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and another plan would</font>

497
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:53,080
be to move that even<font color="#CCCCCC"> further down within</font>

498
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:56,230
the data center so so we were

499
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,360
prototyping this we basically bought a

500
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,970
bunch of this and servers and

501
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,060
with where these cards that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were built</font>

502
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:07,090
we're building and each of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> has two</font>

503
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:09,909
laser pointers pointing to they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just</font>

504
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:13,689
the adjacent users or is a ring network

505
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:15,760
of sort and so we're testing out this

506
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:19,180
configuration at this point so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

507
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,110
one conclusion so what we're doing is a

508
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:27,130
distributor router development modifying

509
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,330
the ospf protocol and we'd play with the

510
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,960
different sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmission</font>

511
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,550
technology we're apparently getting both

512
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,570
public and private funding for the

513
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,570
prototypes of this effort
