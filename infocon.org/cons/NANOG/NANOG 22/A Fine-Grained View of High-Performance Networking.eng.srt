routing side I did the more the jitter

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,840
measurement side what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is about</font>

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,230
is some measurements we've done on a

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,590
transcontinental<font color="#E5E5E5"> tier one u.s. u.s.</font>

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,119
transcontinental tier 1 backbone

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,430
beginning with measurements of jitter

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,800
that was our primary measurement but in

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,160
fact we observed a number of anomalies

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,870
and we as a second step began looking at

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,000
routing protocol packet races in order

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,559
to understand those<font color="#E5E5E5"> anomalies and to</font>

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,280
analyze them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,309
what we found and the purpose of doing

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,110
this was that we believe that these

18
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,010
networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are working very well</font>

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,989
and can support delay critical services

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,879
we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measure the jitter so that</font>

21
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,260
because the the amount of jitter that

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,570
you have determines the volume of

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,548
delayed critical traffic you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font>

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the latency that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide to</font>

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customers but we make the</font>

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,350
observation that there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,460
that need to be fixed so it's equally

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,770
important to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk</font>

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,330
is not about some members of the program

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,158
committee were concerned this could be a

31
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,580
vendor bashing talk and it certainly is

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,159
not it's not particularly important in

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,650
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> even which vendor we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">about or which is P we're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

35
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,060
because I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these problems or</font>

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,250
problems like them are likely to be seen

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,400
on many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the networks that are out</font>

38
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,900
there they're not the fairly rare

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,430
problems as I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about so</font>

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,460
the networks are working mostly pretty

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,700
well and what we really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,500
look more closely so I do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point</font>

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,780
out this is actually a collaboration

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the ISP and the vendor to try to</font>

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,899
analyze and find these problems I'm

46
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,240
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the title of this slide</font>

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,130
intentionally provocative make a

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,460
statement about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of the network</font>

49
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,758
having reporting on data primarily from

50
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,169
observations of one network in school it

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,640
was only the psychs majors who are

52
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,920
allowed to extrapolate from a single

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,910
data point

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,309
anybody in real science but in fact we

55
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,049
have now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently began</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests on</font>

56
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,300
another network we have three days of

57
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,370
testing on that network in Europe and

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,470
the results are similar again most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

59
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,910
the time it's great and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a few</font>

60
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:34,280
funny things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that occur so as I said the</font>

61
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,069
backbones perform fairly well there may

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,260
be problems on access networks but for

63
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:43,819
the most part backbones work very well

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,819
we looked at we have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 weeks of</font>

65
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,708
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've collected for several of</font>

66
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,600
those weeks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> half we found that</font>

67
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">availability was ninety-nine point nine</font>

68
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,420
nine percent so that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> already very</font>

69
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,330
good and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jitter of packet</font>

70
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,670
that we even counting those that were

71
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,680
lost the jitter is less than one

72
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,768
millisecond four<font color="#CCCCCC"> four four nines of</font>

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,530
packets the rest of the packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

74
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:12,739
tolerates very well occasional delays

75
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,660
and so that's why to a large extent if

76
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,060
you're mostly concentrating on PCP

77
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,829
traffic you may not care<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you may not</font>

78
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,000
have noticed or looked closely to see

79
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:24,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these problems are there but there</font>

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,250
are problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move on</font>

81
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:31,040
to the tighter SLA requirements then

82
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,690
then you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to look at them the</font>

83
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,179
other observation about the state of the

84
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:39,230
net is that that routing is perhaps

85
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:42,440
strained but has adapted with various

86
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,010
tweaks and such to handle the growth of

87
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,840
the network over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past several years</font>

88
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,310
that's the routing is really an area

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,489
that we're concentrating on here for the

90
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,250
problems so I think operators have a

91
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,980
pretty good macro view macro level view

92
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this state of the world using the</font>

93
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,170
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools that have listed here but</font>

94
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,208
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> most are not looking more</font>

95
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,319
closely and if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from four</font>

96
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:11,780
9s to five nines then we have to find

97
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:15,078
them more subtle problems which require

98
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,238
a deeper understanding we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

99
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,310
tighter service level agreements for

100
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,858
voice over IP virtual wireless services

101
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,659
VPNs that kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to see</font>

102
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,609
what's happening on a very fine time

103
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:27,099
scale

104
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,750
and over long periods of time and that's

105
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:32,289
basically what we've been doing in these

106
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,659
experiments so they said the basis of

107
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:38,229
the experiments is jitter measurement we

108
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:41,979
installed test host species in pops in

109
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,240
San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DC and make a</font>

110
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:46,960
parenthetical comment here that we've

111
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">been very careful about those the</font>

112
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,710
security of those two<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcs to make sure</font>

113
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,210
that they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get hacked</font>

114
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,878
these are connected directly to core

115
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,120
routers with Giggy Giggy thur links

116
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:04,900
those routers have<font color="#E5E5E5"> have posted 48</font>

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,000
network between them and we're sending a

118
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,688
fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> small level of traffic and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,870
megabit per second but because we use

120
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:15,550
varying lengths and exponential

121
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,129
distribution of the interval<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

122
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:25,020
packets we really are testing something

123
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:25,020
that covers more of a more of a range of

124
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:32,669
packet conditions and the randomization

125
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,960
avoids synchronization with with other

126
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,270
periodic events that may be in the

127
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,089
network so as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've collected</font>

128
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,120
data for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 weeks 15 periods of</font>

129
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:45,069
five to seven days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and then we bring</font>

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,289
that data back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and analyze it because we</font>

131
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:49,180
only have a measly t1 line to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our home</font>

132
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,560

133
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:56,110
the data back so that's why we can't

<font color="#E5E5E5">collect data continuously our yo kind of</font>

135
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:02,680

00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:40,180

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,380
to the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very small delay and</font>

it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right time space and inserts</font>

156
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,650
it in the packet so as we're collecting

157
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,330
the data we get timestamps that have an

158
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,419
accuracy as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the title river</font>

159
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,180
about 20 micro seconds we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running the</font>

160
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:14,800
the data in both directions at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

161
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:18,460
time so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see effects of effects</font>

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that welcome when there's a loop in one</font>

163
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,620
direction for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see what's</font>

164
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening in the other direction that</font>

165
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:27,340
kind of thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we pull the data</font>

166
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,919
back then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> various kinds of</font>

167
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,570
analyses that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do inter-arrival jitter</font>

168
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,130
is an easy way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick overview</font>

169
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,330
that's looking at the difference between

170
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,310
spacing at the transmitter in spacing at

171
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,400
the receiver but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't show</font>

172
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:48,370
everything because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns the steps</font>

173
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,799
into spikes so we also look at those

174
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,930
hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are that have interesting</font>

175
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
phenomena with packet loss and delay and

176
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,860
then for the interesting hours we graph

177
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,620
absolute jitter and what I mean by

178
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,290
absolute jitter is the time difference

179
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,120
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time stamp just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font>

180
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet between transmitter and receiver</font>

181
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,950
now if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that those two</font>

182
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:11,710
clocks are not going to be synchronized

183
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,700
we could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCP to synchronize the</font>

184
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:18,960
clocks but there's a risk that ntps

185
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:21,849
clock adjustment algorithm is going to

186
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,840
cause noise in the data cause something

187
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will interfere with the jitter</font>

188
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,440
measurement so we don't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

189
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,010
just compensate after the fact for the

190
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,880
drift and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clocks so here's my my</font>

191
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,770
first graph that the y-axis here as I

192
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,549
was saying I'm labeling as jitter what

193
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:41,079
that is is the delay from the transit

194

196
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,610
to be the point where most of the

197
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,990
packets lie so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you take the</font>

199
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:56,770
the 0.4 for that bulk of package now

200
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,560
this mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked like a red line some</font>

201
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:03,790
of you may be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that there's a</font>

202
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:06,099
few red spots above the line but I've

203
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,529
put it up in this form<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that there</font>

204
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,600
are 70 million points in the red line

205
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:15,339
and there's a few points that aren't on

206
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:19,260
the red line there's the points for

207
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:21,459
those who couldn't see them before<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

208
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,160
ninety-nine point nine nine percent of

209
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:25,689
the packets are in the red line but

210
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,660
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something else</font>

211
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,339
going on here and around 20 milliseconds

212
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,399
and in fact some below and above that

213
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what that is that's going on we</font>

stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to lose packets</font>

232
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,149
so at each one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> points where</font>

233
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,899
there was a delay<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's also probably</font>

234
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:37,570
a packet that got lost one or two what

235
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:39,220
we've done as a workaround is to put in

236
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,890
permanent<font color="#E5E5E5"> ARP entries but clearly that's</font>

237
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,470
not anything that's workable in a large

238
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:46,270
scale so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> calling on all of the</font>

239
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,770
vengers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ARP</font>

240
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,500
implementations that I know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

241
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:54,610
wrong in this manner so it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

242
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,350
fixed everywhere so some of you may have

243
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">noticed that there were also a couple of</font>

244
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,079
points on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph with negative delay</font>

245
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,510
what does negative delay mean well<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

246
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,020
that these are packets

247
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:10,020
faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the nominal zero point you</font>

248
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">know where most of the packets did and</font>

249
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,880
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look closer at one of those what</font>

250
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:18,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really was is a shift for a short</font>

251
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,470
period of time this is about 40 seconds

252
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the low level there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consumers</font>

253
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,950
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of shifts up and down</font>

254
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:30,040
this is shifting due to rerouting to a

255
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,930
different path the several things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

256
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,170
should notice here the first is that

257
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:44,699
there isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> any there isn't any period</font>

258
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:47,079
of outage there isn't any period of

259
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,760
outage at the beginning of this so this

260
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a rerouting that didn't really need</font>

261
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,689
to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that the route change</font>

262
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't because the link really failed</font>

263
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,310
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting thing to note is that</font>

264
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,250
the shift is downward which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

265
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:06,869
the alternate path is faster is closer

266
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,550
geographically than the primary path I

267
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,560
don't know if that was by design or not

268
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,680
it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it doesn't create a</font>

269
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem but it's unusual or not what I</font>

270
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have expected initially and the</font>

271
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,810
third thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably notice is that</font>

272
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:25,000
there's a bit of a sawtooth<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern</font>

273
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:28,229
there and so close up<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that shows</font>

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's got a period of 2.3 2.4</font>

275
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:36,760
seconds and a height of about five

276
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:39,580
hundred microseconds the fact we were

277
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,110
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a test in the lab the vendor</font>

278
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,360
lab just a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and</font>

279
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:48,339
determine that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this comes from is</font>

280
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,560
the OC 12 ATM interface on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router</font>

281
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:54,310
that's presumably and thus<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

282
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,939
processing if you compare the result for

283
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,770
an OC 48 packet over sonet length then

284
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,550
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get is a little bar down at the</font>

285
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,890
bottom like 10 microseconds so this is

286
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:10,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">from my personal opinion yet another</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">supplies in there</font>

289
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,680
there's some some fuzz in there that the

290
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:23,339
real jitter the points that aren't sort

291
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,560
of on the line or down at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

292
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:30,030
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our problem was fixed then</font>

293
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,400
performance was was really very smooth

294
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,800
this is another test<font color="#CCCCCC"> week after the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

295
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,540

aren't any points off the line there

297
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,930
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> that then something kind of bad</font>

298
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,840
happened there were a couple of shifts

299
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:48,270
but you can see here that there's a

300
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,180
spike that goes off scale so if i zoom

301
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:54,750
out but you can see the full y direction

302
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,689
it's actually seven seconds of delay

303
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,480
that some of the packets experienced the

304

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is still you still</font>

looks bad these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't draw the lines</font>

310
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,490
thin enough the pixels are not been

311
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,380
enough to give you a relative real image

312
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,750
of what the density of this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

313
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,800
happening over a period of nine hours so

314
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:28,500
let me zoom in on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-axis and you see</font>

315
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,579
that that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really are even though</font>

316
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,650
there's a lot of spikes though they're

317
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:36,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">not that dense zooming in even further</font>

318
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,579
here's one of those spikes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit once</font>

319
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,870
things bike again remember that there's

320
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,000
a bunch of packets in the horizontal

321
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">line then there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period of time when</font>

322
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,410
we receive milk packets and then will

323
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,439
receive a whole bunch of packets all in

324
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,469
one short period of time and continuing

325
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,230
to zoom in this is what it looks like in

326
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that bunch of packets that it's zipping</font>

327
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,810
up and down a lot here the height of

328
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,620
this again is seven seconds the width is

329
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:06,719
about 240 milliseconds so you can see

330
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the packets are massively out of</font>

order now if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each do the little</font>

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,160
can begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

338
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:29,370
I have called these things blender

events and because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impression</font>

340
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:35,190
that I got out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it tornado might be</font>

341
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,829
another word<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that there's a</font>

342
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,590
bunch of packets on each line going down

343
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:43,160
and I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you more about what we</font>

344
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:47,130
learned about those lines in a moment

345
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the packets are sort of randomly</font>

346
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,930
spaced on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lines because of the</font>

347
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,300
random spacing of our transmission there

348
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,880
aren't actually any packets lost in this

349
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:01,380
bunch but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some as I say that</font>

350
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,090
are seven seconds old we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

351
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that this was a routing loop</font>

352
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,060
because routing loops I'm supposed to

353
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,710
happen that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocols are</font>

354
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,150
designed to protect against but we

355
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,480
couldn't really figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it might</font>

356
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:17,310
be in our end systems either so we tried

357
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,500
another analysis which is looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

358
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,880
cumulative bits<font color="#CCCCCC"> received simulated</font>

359
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,010
megabits received and normally this

360
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,260
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a straight line like</font>

361
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">following the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first blue line</font>

362
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,430
there's everything is going smoothly but

363
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,330
here what happened is we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of</font>

364
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:36,770
about seven seconds where no packets

365
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:38,910
that those packets are entirely gone

366
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:42,840
eleven hundred and seventy two packets

367
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:44,160
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost and then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next seven</font>

368
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,890
seconds worth of package were all

369
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,500
squeezed together and came in one bunch

370
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,720
at twenty five megabits per second that

371
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,640
the 25 megabits per second is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

372
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,740
link speed and not our<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmit speed</font>

373
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,390
then we conclude that's not something we

374
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,040
could have done from the end system it's

375
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,870
got to be somewhere where our packets

376
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,480
were gathered together with somebody

377
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,970
else's packets and through further

378
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,890
analysis of the routing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> determined</font>

379
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,560
that what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on here this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

380
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:15,000
same blender again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little narrower is</font>

381
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,369
that the packets are in fact going in a

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,630
routing loop if you count there there

383
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:25,050
are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are 31 lines and that</font>

384
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:29,070
corresponds to a loop<font color="#E5E5E5"> of diameter to an</font>

385
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:31,770
initial packet initial TTL<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 64 and a</font>

386
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,200
normal arrival ppl<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two so the ones up</font>

387
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,940
at the top have just about used up their

388
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,350
TTL and there's another line above that

389
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,650
except those are gone because they're

390
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,159
too

391
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,380
l expired looking at another blender

392
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,840
this one happens to be four seconds tall

393
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,970
you can see an artifact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was on that</font>

394
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,889
one as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well that the slope is changing</font>

395
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,070
as it goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what that represents</font>

396
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:56,060
is that the packets are decelerating as

397
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,830
the loop gets longer and longer it takes

398
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:03,330
more packs<font color="#CCCCCC"> build up in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loop and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,060

<font color="#E5E5E5">we implemented some additional</font>

all of the is is routing packets we done

437

transmit them so y de loops happen most

438
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,720
of you know how the routing protocol

439
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,900
works better than I do by

440
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,940
just to review the things that that can

441
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,220
go wrong the way the protocol is

442
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,870
supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work is we detect topology</font>

443
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,929
changes and flood those changes

444
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,760
everywhere compute an SPF on the changes

445
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,620
to know what the new route side that we

446
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,960
can use and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is supposed to</font>

447
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,489
be consistent with in propagation time

448
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,620
it's all supposed to flood around and

their encore screening persistent Luke's

450
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,149
but if the flooding doesn't happen in

451
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,610
time then we can get in trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

452
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:21,520
we saw some specific problems because

that this first problem is a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

the real churn is much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font>

485

picture and due to this problem now this

problem

487
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,900
had already been fixed in a later

488
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,450
release by the time we had observed this

489
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,400
and that later release was already

490
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,830
scheduled to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in place on the network</font>

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:16,450
but it was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pointedly still</font>

492
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:18,250
causing trouble so if you have all of

493
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that churn all of those LSPs that need</font>

494
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:25,750
to be fed<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the network but you</font>

495
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,300
have rate limits on how fast they can be

496
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:31,870

substantial delays the y-axis here is in

498
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:39,040
seconds so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took a hundred and sixty</font>

499
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:41,350
seconds if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at them at the the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">little diagram on the right there we</font>

501
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,870
have an LSP that's originated at the

502
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:49,720
router and bc its scent at approximately

503
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:53,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same time to our test host attached</font>

504
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,590
the router in DC and then sent out

505
00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:00,040
across a few hops of the flooding

506
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,899

507
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,970
network to the router in San Francisco

508
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,120
where our other test toast is connected

509
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:10,270
and then the forwarded by the router

510
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,399
there to art estos so we look at the

511
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,559
sequence number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that LSP in both</font>

places and<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will receive it</font>

513
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,178
in both places<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get a difference of a</font>

514
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred and sixty seconds so that means</font>

515
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:27,100
that that top that top that topology

516
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:29,320
change was seen differently on the two

517
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">sides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the country for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a period of two</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes and a routing loop could persist</font>

for that period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time because of that</font>

520
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,090
inconsistency<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the explanation of the</font>

521
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,130
kinds of loops that we've seen and in

522
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:45,010
fact we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the blender example I showed</font>

525
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,000
approximately two minutes the

526
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">explanation is that there was too much</font>

527
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,640
change to be communicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the rate</font>

528
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:05,559
at which the LSP rate control would

529
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,240
allow we had that the setting as it says

530
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:10,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">here on the on the backbone of the</font>

532
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:20,160
the important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to to match the</font>

the update race allowed to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

537
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,340
and rate limits on how often<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SPF</font>

538
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:34,470
calculations are done which both can

539
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:38,100
cause the databases to be inconsistent

540
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,840
any psychology change here we had some

541
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,209
problems from fake topology changes but

542
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:47,129
any topology change can cause a problem

543
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:50,070
for the blender events we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> are for</font>

544
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:52,500
the the path that it's between our two

545
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,740
test hosts and in particular we were

546
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,570
seeing apparent transitions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the link</font>

547
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the router and the test host at</font>

548
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:04,470
the DC end which weren't really true but

549
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:08,220
occurred because the that reach ability

550
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,900
was moving from one LSP to another back

551
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,670
and forth in between the time it was

552
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,600
taken out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and put into another it</font>

553
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:18,000
appeared to be gone that combined with

554
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,679
delays in communicating that switch

555
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,530
across the network so that pair of

556
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,480
packets might get spread in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font>

561
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:39,300
these problems will both go away but

loop on another path not directly

565

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the lenders that we saw before so</font>

571
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,930
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect is happening in this</font>

572
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,510
case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a routing loop</font>

573
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,490
affecting some other path our packets

574
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,230
flow through the same set of routers and

575
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,150
are experiencing therefore the queue

576
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,610
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> built up from that routing loop in</font>

577
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,230
this case the queues actually build up

578
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,409
enough so that some of our packets are

579
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,330
lost as indicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the blue</font>

580
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,140

581
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,760
packets and irrelevant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lost so</font>

582
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:36,380
this can cause problems on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of</font>

583
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,000
networks question Steve I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

592
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,150
eliminate that problem yes so you're

593
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,440
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the protocol itself by</font>

594
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,850
itself yeah in other words if you

595
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,860
implement the protocol itself without

596
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,629
adding the extra knobs right without

597
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:15,469
doing something like mesh groups right

598
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:17,150
so in fact in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> the let me dress that</font>

00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,200
enrollment on the conclusion slide yes

600
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,550
you're right that's what that's what

601
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really needs to be done is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font>

602
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:27,409
those timers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've shown you several</font>

for a while so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> again hope the</font>

this as a PR and in the previous d

some of the routing problems and so it

650
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:38,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">really is timer settings like this</font>

setting is just too<font color="#E5E5E5"> small for allowing</font>

the necessary number of LSPs to get

00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:52,550
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the routing as I</font>

00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:55,160
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is handling the current scale</font>

657
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:57,169
but it has had to be tweaked to get

658
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,000
there there have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font>

659
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,420
operational emergencies that led to

660
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,120
putting in various kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rate limits</font>

661
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,830
and other protection mechanisms to keep

662
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,709
so you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> from melting and other</font>

663
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:11,750
things but in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meantime they've been</font>

664
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,640
software changes to fix some of those

mesh groups and everyone is afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

667
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the timers again but if</font>

00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,530
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get from the 49 soul to the</font>

670
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:32,030
understand these problems better so

671
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:33,800
we've we've been working on a couple of

672

network as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned this data is</font>

673
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,820
primarily about one network we've begun

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,620
experiments on another network we're

675
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,929
interested in looking at some more

676
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,850
networks and so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from</font>

00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,610
you if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are interested but even</font>

678
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,860
separate from what we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ask you folks</font>

679
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,409
to

680
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,709
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timers again reconsider the</font>

you have on your network in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font>

683
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:03,820
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for improvement to more</font>

684
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:06,730
robust timers we had a talk a couple of

685
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:09,070
nights<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago about reducing the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

686
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,530
time spent on SPF calculations with

687
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:15,070
incremental SPF and there's more that

688
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:18,639
can be done with protecting still

689
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,950
against turn against<font color="#E5E5E5"> excess LSP traffic</font>

690
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,270
but not in a way that harms the traffic

691
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that needs to get through be more</font>

692
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:26,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific about which source your rate</font>

693
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:28,899
limit and there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more ideas there</font>

694
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:32,280
those are beyond the scope of this top

695
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:36,070
and talking maybe at a future nanog so

696
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,480
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we are interested in hearing</font>

697
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">from others who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would would be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">so please send me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email or find me</font>

700
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">afterwards and we can talk more about it</font>

701
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,669
so other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

702
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:12,530
Steve see I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> how these timers</font>

703
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,130
got put into a specific I<font color="#CCCCCC"> osias</font>

704
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:18,940
implementation it was it came out of

705
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:22,159
trying to do a full mesh in over an ATM

706
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:25,070
backbone by a particular provider and

707
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,190
what happened was a the network melted

708
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,980
down so in response we got mesh groups

709
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,900
we got all these timers which are in

710
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:36,470

they cause these persistent loop

for it is about what it boils down to

00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:30,319
it's not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have to go quite</font>

877
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:32,510
as far as these filters illustrate if

878
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,210
you go look back at the numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

882
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,410
the routing table comes from Class A

883
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,020
Class B filters majority of the

884
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,690
unreachable prefixes come from the Class

885
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:53,300
C filter so maybe just the a and B

886
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:55,760
filters is this is a sweet spot in terms

928
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:42,480
portable and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to ask you</font>

929
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:45,270
based on your findings whether you

<font color="#CCCCCC">believe cider is working or not I know</font>

931
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:52,080
you've pretty much already said it but I

932
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:53,730
feel the need to yeah slider what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jensen</font>

number<font color="#E5E5E5"> struggles that slide was breaking</font>

934

<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing and reach ability and one</font>

936
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,069
conclusion from this is you don't lose

937
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,589
much baseline reach ability if the

938
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,030
backbones are really working well maybe

939
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:08,790
the last talk tells us at least in some

940
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:11,010
sense they are maybe you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

941
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:13,800
and it's a question of who's paying and

942
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,270
who's benefiting ultimately I think

943
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,620
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be a strong push from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what the omen we have to go solve that</font>

945
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:21,509
problem the trick is to solve it in a

946
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:24,750
way that doesn't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost burden on</font>
