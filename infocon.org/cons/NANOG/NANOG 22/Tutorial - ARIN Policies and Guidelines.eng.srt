answer those for you now the I our basis

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,009
regional internet registry was a

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,369

00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:59,729
the cost of our operations and our fee

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,860

wasteful allocations someone argue some

327
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,990
would argue to say that there are many

328
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,330

about that at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nano of meeting this</font>

the case that the cider and aggregation

are vital to to what we do and it's a

339
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:24,420
big challenge there's been some

have a lot of news agencies agencies

that contact us and have questions about

the registration process or a policy or

something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're always</font>

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,879
going on right now that that may show a

man for IP address space in the future

512
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,820
so we're paying very close attention to

513
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,830
what's going on at their meetings and

514
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,189
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> their requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be so that</font>

515
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,570
we can address their needs and we can

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,370
speak to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the larger community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">their requirements are so there's no</font>

518
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:57,489
surprises when when some industry comes

519
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:58,629
along like 3g UMTS GPRS that they're

520
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to require a lot of address space</font>

521
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,710
for telling us they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have policies</font>

522
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,150
or they don't they can't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us right</font>

523
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">now exactly what it is they're going to</font>

524
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,510
need or how much address space that are

525
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to need but they might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come across</font>

526
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,770
the board and they might need a large

527
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,090
portion of what's left and the rest of

528
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the community needs to know about that</font>

529
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,490
so we pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> very close attention to</font>

530
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:21,129
industry specific type meetings also we

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,500
provide information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to organizations or</font>

little bit about that in the coming

slides there's responsive policy

registries<font color="#CCCCCC"> training policy is fair to</font>

554
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,990
all try to pay attention to the changing

555
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,830
requirements of the industries like I

556
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:26,740
discussed the 3g GPRS and in the past

557
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:28,419
table was a case and and regional

558
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,310
internet registries understand that

559
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,770
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an evolution of the process and</font>

560
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:35,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that may be true today</font>

561
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,629
about numbers registration may not fit

562
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,100
tomorrow so we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep our ears open</font>

563
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,370
and hear what the community has to say

564
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:45,300
and we make the policy process open to

565
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,300
you so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can effect change</font>

566
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,919
tentacle challenges in policy

567
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,679
development it's a high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

568
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,590
planning and expertise required to

569
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,840
consider these policies we gained a lot

570
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,310
of that from our address<font color="#CCCCCC"> Council or our</font>

571
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,429
advisory council that I talk to you

572
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:03,889
about earlier but also we rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

573
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,300
people within the industry like you may

574
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to give us information on these</font>

575
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:11,419
things specifically on our mailing list

576
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,800
that would help us form a policy and of

577
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">course we're always looking to meet the</font>

578
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,800
demands of the changing environment now

579
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,189
I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to be able</font>

00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:25,610
to read this but what I'm going to do is

581

00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">discrete networks and one of the issues</font>

737
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,670
involved there is that these

738
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:11,790
organizations may have multiple data

739
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:16,290
centers throughout the country and there

740
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:18,960
is a need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> assign at least two / 22</font>

741
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,370
each one of those because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">discreet networks they have different</font>

743
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:26,040
routing policies and if they don't give

744
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,300
a / 22 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network the rest of the</font>

745
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,220

00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a / 22 that to</font>

747
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,580
that Network then they're running into

748
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,640
some difficulty with our policy of

749
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,530
eighty percent in that they have some

750
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,540
data centers that grow at a faster rate

751
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,950
than other data centers so if they take

752
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,750
if they have four data centers and they

753
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,560
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us last 22 each one of those and</font>

754
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:48,030
their allocation from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin with a / 18</font>

755
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:51,030
one data center has grown very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

756
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:53,399
and requires additional address space

757
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:56,670
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other ones have not grown as</font>

758
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,960
quick and they have to come to errand

759
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,580
request additional address basis they

760
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,050
have no other address space to redirect

761
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,260
to that data center because everything

762
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:06,210
needs a 20 and they can't meet our

763
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,040
policy for requesting additional address

764
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,930
space so that puts<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in a real tough</font>

765
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,600
predicament what organizations have done

766
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:15,150
in the past as they said well this data

767
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,669
center can stand alone and justify

768
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,650
address space from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin as as a separate</font>

769
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,420
entity and they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> open up what we</font>

770
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,370
call a separate maintainer accountant

771
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,040
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data center so it doesn't</font>

772
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,959
have to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on these other data centers</font>

773
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,850
growth to to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> additional address</font>

774
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,620
space that it needs and what happens

775
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,969
there is these organizations who

776
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,669
normally would only have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay</font>

777
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:38,270
registration fees of maybe five thousand

778
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:41,100
dollars a year end up opening multiple

779
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,350
multiple accounts with Erin to get

780
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,540
around this policy issue and instead

781
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,820
they're paying us 20 30 40 50 60

782
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,960
thousand dollars a year in feeds so

783
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,610
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a discussion about right</font>

784

that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that about that on our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I already talked about the virtual web</font>

long ago and that the Advisory can

793

so right now is contemplating a policy

report your reassignment information via

reassignment information there there's

806
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:42,989
been some interest in and perhaps adding

another reassignment option and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are</font>

right now and in defining the

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron policies and guidelines so</font>

1017
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:23,020
the the criteria may seem a little less

1018
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,310
stringent for organizations like that

1019
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,170
but we do request quite a bit of

in RFC 2050 RFC 2050 is one of the rfcs

that the registries take a lot of their

00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,070
practices from it's a if you're

1032
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:56,740
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC to read of course you go the</font>

1037
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:10,750
policies there are two phases to ipv6

1038
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,640
policies and these are global policies

1039
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,930
so all three regional internet

1040
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,279
registries operate under the same

1041
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:20,339
policies here the bootstrap phase is the

1042
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,110
phase that were under right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's</font>

transitional and temporary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:28,060
concludes after the first 100 sub TLA

00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:29,770
IDs I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have taken that out to that</font>

1046
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:34,779
language is changing we're taking that

1047
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:38,800
away but but the first 100 / 29 / 35 s

1048
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,080
have been allocated worldwide or after

1049
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,800
Aaron is allocated for our region 60 of

1050
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,569
those blocks of ipv6 address space so

1051
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,120
once collectively all three regional

1052
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:51,580
internet registries have allocated have

made 100 allocations organizations the

bootstrap phase is over or for a

1055
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,820
specific registry if you do 60 in your

1056
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,890
region it's over for your region and

1057
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,240
it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the other registries</font>

1058
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:04,120
only have a handful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may not in</font>

1059
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:07,240
for them then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also have a general</font>

1060
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,160
phase criteria and that's the phase that

phase will conclude by the end of this

the criteria for requesting this doesn't

1116

doesn't seem to be too complicated the

space from them in a turn I have gone

and you had you to give us the technical

point of contact information for each of

1181

the upstream provider / peers including

their full name and an email address

1183
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,900
because will likely go to them and speak

1184
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:24,400
to them and say hey argue provisioning

1185

services for this organization they're

1186
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,060
requesting an AS number and they'll send

1187
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,000
us an email back and say yes not a

1188
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:34,540
problem and it's a not a problem you get

allocated or assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> nes number okay</font>

1190
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,420
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to go straight into the</font>

the registration help desks and meetings

1194
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,220
like these when when we're just talking

1195
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks after a presentation and things</font>

1196
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,799
like that so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe your questions in</font>

1197
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:54,520
here but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can answer some other</font>

1198
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,020
questions afterward the most common

1199
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:59,410
question is can I have a copy of errands

1200
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,540
database until recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answers then</font>

1201
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:03,819
no you can't have a copy of errands

1202
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:06,009
database the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> public in Aaron's</font>

1203
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,140
region the community has told us no we

1204
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:09,790
do not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're giving out copies of</font>

1205
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> errand data based organizations</font>

1206
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:13,720
there's some fear that that marketing

1207
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:17,290
organizations will get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of it and</font>

1208
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:19,270
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be a disaster so we talked</font>

1209
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:22,060
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at our last two meetings and</font>

1210
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:24,009
said well we want to provide some sort

1211
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,810
of copies organizations that need it if

1212
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:27,850
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> show us they have a need for it</font>

1213
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:30,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the community has responded in</font>

1214
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:33,370
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can give a copy of the</font>

database to research organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1216
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:39,580
and strips from that data will be any

on a statistics project on putting

taking all of our statistics about

registration and putting them in a like

1223

format so research organizations can

1224
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:58,090
just go grab that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from ripe</font>

00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:59,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">ap neck and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron and put it all</font>

together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do what they need to do</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data without having to worry</font>

about different the different format

that it may be provided in one region or

<font color="#CCCCCC">the other that information is available</font>

on our ftp site now most extensive copy

to fill out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a form</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that basically states</font>

1238
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:29,840
and they they have to identify a

1239
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,970
responsible individual they have to sign

1240

an acceptable use policy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

those things and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we receive that from</font>

1242
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:39,740
them and they are indeed going to be

1243
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:41,960
using that for research purposes and

1244
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">they've signed the AUP will issue a copy</font>

1245
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,490
of the database minus the poor and

1246
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,440
contact information to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them another</font>

1247
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:50,120
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we hear a lot is how do i</font>

1248
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the organization name on my</font>

1249
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:57,440
network or a s registration so you have

1250
00:52:53,650 --> 00:53:01,220
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how your address space was</font>

1251
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,710
was assigned are allocated to you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1252
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive your allocation or assignment</font>

1253
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:09,250
directly from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron then you would fill</font>

1254
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,779
out Aaron's modification templates and

1255
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,760
submit that to host master<font color="#CCCCCC"> darren net</font>

1256
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will update any information about</font>

1257
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,300
your record that you need updated and

1258
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:22,250
i'll go through the website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

1259
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:24,920
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you where that information is ok if</font>

1260
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,810
you receive your address space from an

1261
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,580
upstream provider so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

1262
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:30,529
received your reassignment and you have

1263
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:33,140
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> record in the Aaron whois database but</font>

1264
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:34,850
it's a reassigned record Aaron cannot go

1265
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,560
in and change those reassignment records

1266
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,330
because they don't belong to us they

1267
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,150
belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the organization that created</font>

1268
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:43,340
it so you would have to work with your

1269
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:45,020
upstream provider to get the information

1270
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,730
changed on your record in the air in

1271
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,520
whois database because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the owner</font>

1272
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:50,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that of that record and they would</font>

1273
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,160
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process called Swift that we</font>

1274
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,049
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier to share who is</font>

1275
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,580
project they use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swift template to</font>

1276
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,130
create a network they can also use a

1277
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:01,730
swift template to modify a network for

1278
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:05,690
the downstream customers another

1279
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:09,580
question we receive is how do i add an

1280
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:11,930
adder service servers to my network

1281
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,009
along the same lines is the answer last

1282
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:14,450
time depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on where you got your</font>

1283
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:15,650
address space from if you got it

1284
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:17,299
directly from the regional internet

1285
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:19,520
registry you fill out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

1286
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,290
modification template and you identify

1287
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,640
what the servers are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will update</font>

1288
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,560
your record to include that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

1289
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:29,509
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll send that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the root servers</font>

1290
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:32,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you're an adder works if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1291
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:33,770
received your if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive your</font>

1292
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:35,870
address space from an upstream provider

should be so if you want to filter at /

1341
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:42,440
if Aaron allocates say<font color="#E5E5E5"> its last 21</font>

1342
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:44,450
organization and for some reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1343
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,910
they're having problems with the route

1344
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:49,560
ability of that address space there's

1345
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:51,120
really nothing Aaron can do about that

1346
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,920
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron does not set routing</font>

1347
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,470
policy for the operators you do that

1348
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,990
yourselves so basically an organization

1349
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:00,839
would have to deal with the entity

1350
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:04,560
that's causing the conflict now if by

1351
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:07,220
chance the conflict is that there is an

1352
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:10,440
overlapping registration somewhere which

1353
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:12,540
doesn't happen maybe in the past that's

1354
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,340
happened once or twice definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

1355
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,870
take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that like if we we've</font>

1356
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,940
issued you a dress<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bates at someone</font>

1357
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:20,130
someone else has already been registered

1358
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,960
or something like that we can definitely

1359
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with that and there may have been</font>

1360
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,850
some instances where someone is

1361
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:28,410
announcing address space out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1362
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:30,180
has never been allocated to anyone

1363
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:33,930
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just making these bogus</font>

1364
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,100
announcements and you know the time for

1365
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:36,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that address space the out to be</font>

00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,190
allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> just happens to come up when</font>

1367
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,990
it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you get an allocation and</font>

1368
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:41,640
you get that / 20 but someone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1369
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">already announcing you're not going to</font>

1370
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,180
have to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization's</font>

1371
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:49,290
that's doing a bogus route we would be

1372
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:50,970
glad to speak to that organization or to

1373
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:55,620
speak to their up streams and explain

1374
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:57,419
why they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the authority to</font>

1375
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,740
announce that address space and explain

1376
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:03,600
the registration issues involved with

1377
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:05,520
that and the last four questions that we

1378
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,080
receive on a regular basis what is the

1379
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,460
difference between an assignment and an

1380
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:13,319
allocation well in registry terms and

1381
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,820
allocation is address space that is

1382
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,700
issued to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization that will</font>

1383
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:19,890
provide services with that address space

1384
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,649
it will further assign it or allocate it

1385
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:26,730
down to their downstream customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1386
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:29,700
an assignment<font color="#CCCCCC"> is address spaces issued</font>

1387
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:31,380
to an entity entity that will own is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1388
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,149
insight they're only using it for their

1389
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,680
network they're not using it to provide

1390
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">services to someone or anything like</font>

1391
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:40,680
that that's the difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1392
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:43,950
allocation and an assignment the how

1393
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:47,069
long does it take for Aaron to look at

1394

my request you yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're gonna have</font>

can<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the tape here let's take a</font>

information we need to approve your

your request so we can qualify you for

it's it's better if we can make the

that Aaron is going to lose a little bit

1506
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:02,078
that Aaron staff make up the rules as

they go along this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is simply not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> true it</font>

you the public or the community within

1517
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:34,470
the region another misconception is that

01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron is difficult to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1519

I'm partial but I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1520
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:42,000
difficult to deal with some people may

1521
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,520
feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they submit a request for</font>

1522
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,140
address space to Aaron that they've got

1523
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,900
some staff person sitting on the other

on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> end trying to disqualify</font>

that might disqualify them for received

from receiving address<font color="#E5E5E5"> based I've had</font>

1529
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,220
people tell me they felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way but on</font>

1530
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,460
the contrary the actual attitude at

1531
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:06,899
Aaron is that we have the criteria we

1532
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,740
review each request according to those

1533
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:12,390
criteria but we do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can to</font>

1534
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,189
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> an organization meet those criteria</font>

1535
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,660
so that they can receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1536
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:17,940
allocation or assignment directly from

1537
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:20,069
the registry that is the attitude we

1538
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:23,880
have when we review requests just want

1539
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:25,290
to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and another enter</font>

misconception we already talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1541
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:29,220
this is that Aaron's of the internet

police we're not the internet police we

1543

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it our mailing list as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I discussed</font>

recommendation from the IBI ASG it's

1764
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:48,130
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely that is going to happen very</font>

1765
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:49,299
soon but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't say for sure because I</font>

1766
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:51,160
don't make the policies you guys do

1767
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,640
someone comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up if you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all want to</font>

1768
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,769
come out

01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,690
speak in opposition to it feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1770
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:58,510
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it may not happen then</font>

1771
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:59,830
but i believe consensus states that it

1772
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:03,280
will happen so it's likely you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1773
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that here in the next month or so any</font>

1774
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:09,240
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions all right thank you very</font>
