back as well back to a certain source

82
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:32,630
and the original focus of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregate</font>

83
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:35,260
work was focused on the station

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect the</font>

back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the victim and furthermore</font>

91
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,630
doesn't work well if you try to compute

<font color="#E5E5E5">ranging these hoops authentic source</font>

94
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:02,930

95
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,300
variation that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> p formal is two</font>

97
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,020

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,570
compute a gift so look at things like a

99
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,330
cat lands pcl distributions even hash

100
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,400
the packet payload and the second is to

101
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,590
look at distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these parameters</font>

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">over time an attempt to decrease</font>

103
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,469
collateral damage so the question won't

104
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,510
you ask me at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is how can</font>

105
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,750
history be useful you know what we get

106
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:32,090
from looking at historical data and the

107
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,720
intuitive insight which will also

108
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,008
confirmed from collecting data from

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,439
order of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dozen network so</font>

110
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:41,059
the last year eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in fact many</font>

111
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,680
parameter distributions tend to be well

00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:45,919
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> stable they don't change very much</font>

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,110
overtime so an example actually

114
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately I see that the plots or</font>

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,860
source addresses of incoming packets and

125
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,490

00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,270
fact that the graphs are very similar

310

00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:55,629
administrative domains and therefore

312
00:13:51,009 --> 00:14:00,769
encourages potential policy or you know

313
00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:07,970
human collaboration issues so our

314
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:09,649
approach is to minimize the change that

315
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,989
needs to happen to existing

316
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:15,649
infrastructure in particular the goal is

317
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:19,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not poke devices that are on the</font>

318
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:22,419
network at all and to try to minimize

319
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,619
communication between different

320
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:27,569
administrative domain so first in

321
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:29,700
different ISPs and this

322
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,400
this piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slide we're here which</font>

323
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,720
I'll use to give an example of how the

324
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,300
protocol that we've implemented actually

325
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:41,430
operates<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of the earth the</font>

327
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,459
idea is at the bottom level there's

328
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,689
already deployed infrastructure routers

329
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:53,670
switches and so forth the goal is to

330
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:56,010
passively monitor links that are major

331
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,620

334
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,800
define a well specified set of machines

335
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,780
and call<font color="#CCCCCC"> knock servers to allow</font>

336
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,500

337
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:16,290
administrative domains so give you a

338
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,870
quick example before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I move into some</font>

357

such and such payload hash and take this

358
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,860
query and propagates it to both other

359
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,510
domains so other peer knock servers and

360
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,330
two other monitors as in this

361
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,680
information is that the data collection

362
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,540
happened a complete distributed manner

363
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,910
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information can then be</font>

364
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,800
returned to the clearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> master server</font>

365
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,689
which can provide essential information

366
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,349
about English and egress points of the

367
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,110
suspect traffic to an operator these

368
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,230
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said and</font>

369
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:36,270
really what I what I want to move to is

370
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:40,529
motivations for this design which as I

371
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:42,269
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've for large degree implemented</font>

372
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:44,490
so there's really three categories of

373
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:46,860
design criteria the design criteria for

374
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,980
the individual monitoring technology

375
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,439
that has obtained information about

376
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,550
attacks on a link the second is blank

377
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:55,889
right here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the devices</font>

378
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,170
communicate and third is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> design</font>

379
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,689
criteria for filtering how do you

380
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">influence filtering so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font>

381
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:05,309
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we believe very strongly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

382
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:09,480
guess this is in contrast to rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

383
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:12,329
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous talk is that tapping</font>

384
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,329
links is actually operationally the

385
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:18,359
least intrusive way of doing things we

386
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:21,178
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried again both approaches and I</font>

387
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:25,289
guess both Rob and I have contrasting

388
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:28,409
anecdotal evidence but certainly many

389
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:31,770
operators of large high heavily loaded

390
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:34,289
routers don't like it when one has to

391
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,799
obtain information from those routers so

392
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:39,720
it appears<font color="#CCCCCC"> that tapping the network at</font>

393
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:44,100
the link level with the vector is fiber

394
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,929
splitters is the least intrusive we're

395
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,668
doing so this also provides increased

396
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:50,490
visibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> and traffic to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

397
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:53,429
since the data collection method<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

398
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,350
net flow or<font color="#E5E5E5"> see floaty that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font>

399
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:57,539
get data from router doesn't return say

400
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,240
TTL information we can do that through

401
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:04,289
direct packet inspection so things like

402
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,210
it more general approach it's the second

403
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:07,890
decision rated for monitoring devices

404
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,549
that really they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> storing state</font>

405
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:14,130
of first because this enables historical

406
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,559
analysis which as I earlier can help to

407
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,220
decrease false positives and collateral

408
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,480
damage in general so the second is that

409
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,190
that can help to minimize<font color="#CCCCCC"> into monitor</font>

410
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">communications so some schemes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

411
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,679
proposed where edge routers actually

412
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:33,179
send a traffic relating to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> suspicious</font>

413
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:35,220
across versus IP tunnels to some central

414
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,230
collecting agency which then tries to

415
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">determine whether traffickers process</font>

416

call is the cause of us back<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not and</font>

417
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,850
that that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually potentially</font>

418
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,350
cause basket back on the monitoring

<font color="#CCCCCC">communication I believe that hierarchy</font>

427
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,910
is key because providing a hierarchical

very much advocate is an open standard

443

for communication because all these

deployed very widely and final bit of

451
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:13,720
religion with that our claim today is

452
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:16,990
filtering policy and weirder<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suki things</font>

453
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,000
there the first is the needs of separate

454
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,550
filtering from monitoring it's much

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,480
easier for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-speed operator</font>

impose a filtering strategy as part of

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,110
that tracking mechanism so the to

462
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,510
rethink kind of missed rated we need to

463
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,490

and design criteria is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there should</font>

467
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,880
then we were opening ourselves up to

<font color="#CCCCCC">people who especially smarter than the</font>

traced back in push back in both of

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:23,870
these at some level are very elegant

477
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,059
because they make monitoring part of the

478
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:29,360
network itself but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that really</font>

479
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,678
wanted to minimize that that's not

separate a very cleanly filtering policy

<font color="#CCCCCC">from monetary policy of course</font>

487
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,890
distributed monitoring as we call it has

488
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,760
its own challenges the first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

489
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:01,669
is that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> requires deployment of new</font>

490
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,250
monitoring devices and really we see

491
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:06,410
this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade off either you change</font>

492
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:09,770
infrastructure there that works and that

493
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:12,980
most people don't want to change or you

494
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:15,168
need to effectively deploy new devices

495
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,990
that are you know perform a specific

496
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:21,679
monitoring task as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> posting is</font>

497
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,299
concerned it really seems to be no free

498
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,130
and easy solution if you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to filter</font>

499
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:30,830
by our routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> right by creating a CLS</font>

500
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,480
for instance that might be used or you

501
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,490
know committed access rate type things

502
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,890
that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to filter traffic and</font>

503
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,110
routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we listen we risk decreasing</font>

504
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,360
router performance and furthermore were

505
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,580
limited by the expressiveness of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ACO</font>

506
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,159
language itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if the weather</font>

507
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">allows the filter by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ppl and you know</font>

508
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,870
there's no use to using pto basic

509
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,149
statistics using a dedicated device<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

510
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,428

00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">both the speed and expressiveness and of</font>

course introduces a new network element

513
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:03,590
so nothing things to come for free these

514
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:05,620
days and the final challenge really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

515
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:11,168
any scheme that attempts to do

distributed data analysis is to

517
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:13,880
generally

518
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,320
lament American<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have open</font>

519
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:20,450
standard for communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> between these</font>

520
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:23,360
devices just a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> word on our own</font>

521
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,030
sort of implementation status if you

522
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,510
will the heuristics that I described

523
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:32,540
today as well as several others are

524
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:34,879
implemented devices that run them can

525
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,320
monitor up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eight gig e links at about</font>

526
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,640
a million packets per second per link

527
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,629
and we had a fair degree of success

528
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,429
deploying on a number of commercial

529
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,230
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we've actually been able</font>

530
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:48,679
to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help users the bug</font>

531
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,600
denial of service attacks first version

532
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,460
of the monitoring protocol that I so

533
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,230
roughly described earlier is actually

534
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,660
implemented and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we the focus that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

536
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:02,510
on most is improving the detection of

537
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:06,530
heuristics and also building filtering

538
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,970
functionality so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion I think</font>

539
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:13,330
that combining aggregates to inspire

540
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:15,620
development with historical information

541
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:19,490

method of identifying an officer escape

544
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,870
while minimizing collateral damage and

minimizes<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain communication is</font>

549
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:37,400
probably a reasonable way to go to try

552

I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave you today leave with</font>

one quick question before you leave as

561
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,428
we saw the the ambient level of attacks

562
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,850
on the network seems to be at a fairly

563
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:33,539
high level just<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a day-to-day basis</font>

564
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:35,939
and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these systems seemed to be</font>

565
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:38,340
extremely good at detecting the attacks

566
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,380
and telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I'm being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked almost</font>

567
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:45,689
constantly which is not a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful</font>

568
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:49,049
piece of information um how well do

569
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:52,260
these systems are at prioritizing

570
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:55,559
attacks and telling me what are the big

571
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:58,500
attacks or how well can I tell them tell

about things like server attacks like

detecting whether you're under a dart

623
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,830
attack or and then the second question

624
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:44,370
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what are the dots packets so</font>

00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:48,059
it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite difficult in</font>

like us to for instance by one thing to

00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:04,350
do is filter of course by destination

course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's deployment of devices on</font>

716
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:58,149

automatically drop packets based on

718
00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:03,189

719
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:05,168
possibly very uh yeah that's how

720
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,509
problematic well if you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

721
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:09,249
doing like a CL based on historical data

722
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:10,450
I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely see the room for</font>

723
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:13,090
problems there but if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a congested link a packet has to be</font>

725
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">dropped there might be an advantage to</font>

726
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:22,658
weighing that drop based on the normalcy

727
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,749
of the packet rather than just first-in

728
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:29,730
first-out or another probability metric

729
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:33,220
yeah well again you know I think unless

730
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:34,990
in that case things like red I think you

731
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,970
know things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are completely random</font>

732
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,850
or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what probability changes</font>

733
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,539
based on the queue length seem like

734
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,580
they're the least likely to introduce

735
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:45,080
sort of vicious side<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects that might</font>

736
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,369
be exploited for the purposes i think if

737
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,840
we if you reach I to be smart about

738
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:49,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">filtering and these things like history</font>

739
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,139
or whatever then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be very useful</font>

740
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,549
and I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

741
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:54,080
advocating I think that's something

742
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:58,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">where a human is to be involved or else</font>

743
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're in trouble</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you yep</font>
