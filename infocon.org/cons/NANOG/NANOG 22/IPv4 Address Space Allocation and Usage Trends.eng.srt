yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be talking about</font>

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,620
primarily utilization of ipv4 addresses

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a topic that's been of interests</font>

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:24,439
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF and also here now in doing</font>

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,740
that I'll be excuse me I'll be actually

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,600
touching on three areas one of them is

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,150
to provide a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> background on why</font>

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,760
the rirs the regional internet

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,670
registries got strongly interested in

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,019
doing this kind of proactive ongoing

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,930
forecasting the rate at which the

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,300

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a beautiful textbook trend</font>

36
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:39,408
it's an exponential growth curve and

37
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,549
since there's only 64,000 of them it was

38
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,289
pretty clear cut that we would be

<font color="#CCCCCC">hitting the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wall around 2005 and this</font>

a quadratic rather than exponential

curve we looked at that it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

52
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,180
that

53
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,310
much more likely to track the

54
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:21,260
exponential and again if you look the

63
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:46,099
now for us that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of a wake-up</font>

too vgp speaking routers but it can be

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should also have the a s numbers</font>

78
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,690
are sort of a related problem to the

79
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,918
routing table bloat that we've been

80
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,410
hearing a great deal about especially

81
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Geoff Huston that's a separate</font>

82
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:34,220

83
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:36,739
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing okay in any case</font>

84
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,660
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> along so within the registries</font>

85
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,989
this really drove a strong perception

86
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,329
that we needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be tracking this stuff</font>

87
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,919
in a much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> proactive manner I know</font>

88
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,959
for me in particular it was kind of

89
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,120
striking that unidentified that we were

90
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for administering would be</font>

91
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,299
running out in four years and that it

92
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:58,160
hadn't really been noticed so what we

93
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,919
did was to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together sort of a blue</font>

94
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">ribbon team to do analysis of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this type</font>

95
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:08,329
and also what we've begun to do is to

96
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,299
take the data of allocation the

97
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:13,459
allocation records maintained by three

98
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:16,489
separate global registries three

99
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:19,728
separate regional registries put it into

100
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,839
a consistent format and put it up in

101
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,789
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> view so that an independent</font>

102

103
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,599
it and without having to know the

vagaries of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> indie</font>

105

registries in that process at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

106
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:34,500
is well along now the team that we

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,939
assembled includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Frank's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lensky who</font>

resources as needed out of the

113
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,888
registries and make trouble when need be

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:56,719
and this process had very fine support

115
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,719
from all three of the registries

116
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,229
basically the idea was that we'd be

117
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,949
doing proactive projections on a regular

118

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,060
off the size of the allocations this

124
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:22,830
represents the allocations per year and

125
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,599
the data as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see are a little</font>

126
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,900
hard to extract a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense from in</font>

127
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,188
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> form the most obvious point is that</font>

128
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,960
the amount of address space being

129
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:33,479
allocated in years past is a lot greater

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,229
than what's being allocated today much

131
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:40,529
clearer is the cumulative graph and here

132
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:43,159
the yellow or cream-colored are the

80s you've got something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feels like</font>

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,690
simplistic kind of linear fit which

147
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,209
exhaustion really pretty far out recall

148
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,740
that there's that there's slightly less

149
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,000
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four billion you'd assume their</font>

150
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,550
various blocks that are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,899
but still there's this quite a while

152
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,000
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the wall in a model like</font>

153
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:53,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">this the the correct formulation the one</font>

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,569
that you would really expect could

155
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,419
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called the logistic</font>

156
00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:00,209
curve and as you can see if logistic

157
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,039
curve really should go nearly flat a

158
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,569
better view of it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is here this</font>

159
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,389
work by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was done by our</font>

161
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,009
he did the heavy lifting on this stuff

162
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,330
and as you can see the logistic does

163
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:18,719
seem to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good description</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

what's happening now with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

165
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:24,529
said well I say let me move on for a

166
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:28,620
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this result is consistent with</font>

167
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,940
a number of other measures what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

168
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">showed you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is based on allocation</font>

169
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,940
records from the registries themselves

170
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,860
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the addresses allocated if you look</font>

171
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,750
at address growth within the routing

172
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,630
tables and this comes from Jeff

173
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,110
Houston's data again you see an upward

174
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:49,500
trend but it's a gradual trend the the

175
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,149
blue line there represents his raw data

176
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,469
the pink line is cleaned up to take

177
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,819
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eliminate some</font>

178
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:57,270
announcements and class<font color="#CCCCCC"> aids and sort of</font>

179
00:07:53,819 --> 00:08:00,120
pop in and out so the pink one is the

180
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:04,198
one you'd want to see and again another

181
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,529
way to view this is the addresses in use

182
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:11,459
where the red line represents the

183
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,379
allocations the blue comes from Jeff

184

<font color="#E5E5E5">Houston's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bed and represents the</font>

187
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,459
it represents data from telcordia is net

188
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,050
sizer service which tries to estimate

189
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,870
the number of addresses in use based on

190
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,430
the number of permanent reverse inadar

191
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,430
mapped addresses

192
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:39,609
also interesting to note that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

193
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,700
addresses as reflected in the routing

194

tables again from Jeff Houston's data

195
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:54,250
are a gradually increasing percentage of

196
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:56,469
the total allocated as you'd expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

197
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,610
now here we come to a little different

198
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,220
point i'll be spending just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

199
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">moments on it um how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people here</font>

200
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,190
are seeing reports in the press or at

201
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:08,560
the ipv6 forum perhaps claiming that

202
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:14,050
ipv4 addresses would be exhausted by

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,969
2005 actually show of hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

204
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,520
where that data came from<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

205
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,200
report prepared by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a actually three</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pulling a lot and in it they've done an</font>

208
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,439
interesting analysis of address

209
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,729
consumption and it comes to a radically

210
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,650
different conclusion of course than the

211
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,270
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just showed you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in and so</font>

212
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,230
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we really have to address the</font>

213
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:43,079
question why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the figures</font>

214
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">from it and the three curves represent</font>

215
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,250
what the report claims to be a most

216
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,850
optimistic rate at which the addresses

217
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,530
are being exhausted a most likely and a

218
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,230
worst-case one that's consistent with

219
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,760
most rapid exhaustion in these tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

220
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,710
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they would indeed run out</font>

221
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,910
between as you between 2004 and 2007 the

222
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,230
problem is that those curves are

223
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,390
actually based on an assumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

224
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:12,400
greater that the rate of growth would be

thirty percent fifty percent or eighty

declining<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff Houston was independently</font>

233
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,050
estimated this based on routing table

234
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,540
statistics and came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> about seven</font>

235
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,949
percent and based on the fact what he's

236
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,599
capturing is a slightly different number

237
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,550
than ours I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's perfectly</font>

238
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,029
reasonably in agreement with our day

239
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,649
um in this case I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they got</font>

240
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,600
that they're basically making an

241
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:50,620
assumption of an incorrect rate of

242
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,360
growth and therefore reaching the

243
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:58,480
incorrect conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's personal</font>

244
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,860
opinion but in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> case what says is i</font>

245
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,110
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the report has to be taken</font>

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,940
with a grain of salt the other the other

247
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,370
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the report actually is more what</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I consider a marketing analysis</font>

which internet performance internet

we should need this many in the future

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:21,310
basically that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

the report are not well documented not

257
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,860
well substantiated I think there's

258
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,779
really not enough there to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a clear</font>

259
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,450
challenge on it in any case I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

260
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:33,459
key point on it would be i think that

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">the report is reaching conclusions that</font>

should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking with large grain of</font>

263

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,689
to do things that are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good</font>

265
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,319

the growth in the rate of prefixes was

supports that for the growth for in

345
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:25,120
that this is an economic domain and this

know Jeff Houston believes that this may

00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,740
see Phil is nodding so so frankly I had

to I somewhat question<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jess contention</font>

371
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,540
that it's a purely local phenomenon and

373
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,849
is indeed the economic conditions so I

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important I would say for</font>

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,540
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a good thing for</font>

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,760
it's sort of not our area of expertise

380
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,410
and it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably get a little more</font>

381
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,180

want to but implicitly that will be

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,980
looked like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was much smaller amounts</font>

well if another good question um it's a

398
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,590
it's a potential issue and it's one that

399
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,770
requires close watching the

before the registers really were fully

throttling back on the allocation so

407
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,799
it's not entirely consistent trend going

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,299
all the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> back but if you track it</font>

409
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,309
back to about 1996 there's a growth

410
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,700
curve for asia-pacific that could very

411
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,750
well be an exponential growth curve and

412
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,580
that curve would be consistent with

413
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,440
consumption of about 250 million

414
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:26,779
addresses between now and two thousand

415
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,029
five that's it's not big enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

417
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,169
doesn't exhaust what's there it's

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> where if it actually if it</font>

for concern it's certainly something we

428
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:01,399
the growth is slowed down is because of

00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:04,908
the allocation policies themselves not

430
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:08,649
because of latent demand and you know

431
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:12,049
the ipv6 forum is made up of people who

432
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:14,870
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses the address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

433
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:18,429
would have grown more if it could have

434
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:22,668
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I certainly know of</font>

435
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:28,220
requests for / 6 net locks that were

436
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ipv4 space and there</font>

437
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,470
are a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who simply cannot</font>

438
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,760
bring certain applications to market or

439
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,640
at least they claim they can't and

440
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,270
they're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend money to enable</font>

441
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:45,080
this whole ipv6 technology thing so to

442
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,668
the extent that it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun to poke</font>

443
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,470
holes at the claims that they've made

444
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:52,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's also necessary to maybe ask them to</font>

445
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,440
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> records of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plans when they have</font>

446
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,149
asked for the amount of address space

447
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,920
they thought they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need and</font>

448
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:58,120
they thought they could

449
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,090
justify and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned away</font>

450
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,370
because that graph I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would show a</font>

451
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,260
much worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> trends than the actual</font>

452
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:09,699
allocation graph which of course is

453
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:11,470
being managed by registry policy I think

454
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no question that what we're</font>

455
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:17,800
seeing is to a very significant degree

456
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:20,620
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> artifacts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> registry policy in fact if</font>

457
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> even look at the at the graphics up</font>

458
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,689
on the screen it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very likely that the</font>

459
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,969
steep part of the graph would have

460
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,630
carried forward if the registries

461
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,730
weren't attempting to to keep a lid on

462
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:36,070
allocation policies and I think the

463
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,990
point that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise is a good one in</font>

464
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,470
another sense which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it raises</font>

465
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question to through these policies</font>

466
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,170
you know while they've been necessary to

467
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,760
contain growth you know there's a public

468
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,340
policy question whether they may perhaps

469
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,560
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of transferring costs to</font>

470
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">the wrong people but it which is a</font>

471
00:20:53,560 --> 00:21:00,129
complex question what's a real question

472
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:04,540
one it can't be it can't be dodged yes

473
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:07,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> stated that the allocation rate for</font>

474
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,870
a SMS was fitting very well to an

475
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,010
exponential curve on and that the prefix

476
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,100
is that we're actually seeing the

477
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:17,980
routing table are a much flatter growth

478
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,520
that correct I didn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

479
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,620
I mean the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> day this is the</font>

480
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:27,520
halloween exponentially as far as the

481
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,110
routing table prefixes um first<font color="#E5E5E5"> up I</font>

482
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,870
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> personally been doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis</font>

483
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,060
on them a second if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at Jeff</font>

484
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,219
Houston's data and analysis he would

485
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,600
argue I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that since 1998 they're</font>

486
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,240
actually following a curve slightly

487
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,870
faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> than an exponential growth curve</font>

488
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,460
sort of super exponential growth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

489
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,959
guess lastly as I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> raising a question</font>

490
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,430
as to whether it's perhaps slowed to

491
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,900
something significantly less over the

492
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,160
past few months for reasons that you

493
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">know maybe aren't fully understood</font>

494
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,020
though the reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was following that</font>

495
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,610
was and not based on IP address

496
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:03,100
allocation rate was the statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

497
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">SN growth is exponential profit question</font>

498
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,540
in my mind is you know when are we going

499
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,750
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be when the majority of new asn</font>

500
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,760
allocations won't actually be

501
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:15,600
advertising any prefixes so that's where

502
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,070
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going with that thank you I'm</font>

503
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,560
sorry I didn't quite catch that when the

504
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,500
majority of a us in allocations won't be

505
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,810
advertised well if the growth of

506
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,430
prefixes that were advertised for less

507
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,649
than the growth of a SN allocation at

508
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:30,150
some crossover point most asn at<font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font>

509
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">ason allocations would not be</font>

510
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,430
advertising any prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you're not</font>

511
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that yeah I'm not saying I don't</font>

512
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:44,570
need it today I'm definitely not saying

513
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:44,570
that thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ok thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>
