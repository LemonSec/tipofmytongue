you manage that incident that would open

a ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would sponsor the bridge</font>

rack that can provide translation

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,380
faster than sooner than later I actually

this by ourselves we put some things

together but we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of help in</font>

253
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,130
finalizing putting this all together so

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,450
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pending issues</font>

right now but this is what we're working

258
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,810
on this is what we want to discuss this

259
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what we want a broader audience to</font>

260
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,219
come and join<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on mailing lists</font>

261
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,260
possibly in a physical meeting or two to

262
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,940
debate some of these issues we're

263
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,100
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at cost recovery we're not</font>

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,880
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at profit and we're trying to</font>

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,770
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to make it as affordable</font>

266
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,810
to as many isps possible while still

267
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,279
being able to pay the vendor so should

268
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,140
larger eyes please pay more and if so

269
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,810
why should they pay more do they get a

270
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,860
benefit out of that we're wondering

271
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,510
whether there should be membership

272
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,430
requirements in other words who should

273
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,189
participate should there be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cut-off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,170

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,610
participate through someone else what

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,709
qualifies them as an Internet service

281
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,920

<font color="#E5E5E5">been a really major issue for both us</font>

and and some of the regulatory people

287
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,339
should it be minimum participation

288
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,350
requirements in other words you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

to be collating information simplifying

a nice Shack we've collected some sales

321
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,199
quotes which is why we can give a rough

322
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,460
estimate we've got some idea of maybe

323
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,320
who our vendors going to be although

experts we talk to the other I shacks

327
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,250
will try to learn from problems that

they had or are having right now and I'm

329

here to talk about this to take feedback

330
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:33,580
to to get people to participate recruit

331
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:38,530
volunteers and to actually launch the

332

that's it open<font color="#CCCCCC"> for questions</font>

347
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,840
yeah I want to ask a question that came

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:28,910
up when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I se first proposed something</font>

349
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:33,240
called the bind members forum which is

350
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:35,250
how will you qualify members to make

351
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,840
sure that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing white hats</font>

352
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:41,070
rather than very black ones that is an

00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,780
excellent<font color="#CCCCCC"> question that's something that</font>

354
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,210
we haven't specifically resolved yet

355
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,699
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I'm hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

356
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:52,080
get good feedback from potential members

357
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,760
to talk about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out I know that</font>

358
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,020
there are a lot of white hat ISPs out

359
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,050
there that don't know that they have

360
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,670
black hats in there knocks or maybe not

361
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">even black ass but people who think that</font>

362
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,550
they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing by</font>

363
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,500
forwarding outages and reporting out

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,569
forwarding outage information to more

365
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,830
public mailing lists and maybe they are

366
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,510
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the right</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thing maybe we are too close-minded and</font>

368
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:14,790
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change some of that behavior</font>

369
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:18,720
but we haven't we haven't figured it out

yet we're hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll help us there</font>

371
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,290
are some people working in some of those

372
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:29,310
narcs were causing some of the problems

373
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:31,920
because they think it's fun well both

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:46,380
just sniffing the messages modifying his

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:48,089
server so pardon so communication is

401
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,519
always a good thing but unless you can

402
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:53,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">assure ensure one hundred percent that</font>

403

communication kind of leak it's a very

404
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">very dangerous thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and I guess</font>

405
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,560
the only way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is to qualify</font>

406
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,730
your participating members better than

407
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:09,959
just saying a dude you're nice p.m. come

408
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:13,019

409
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,388
do it was we had a very very formal

410
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,160
introductory meeting with everybody

411
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:19,139
wanted to join in which eventually

412
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,370
ruined eurosex because nobody wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

413
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:25,620
join anymore so personally I I know

414
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,839
there's this three layers this layer

415
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,730
number one engineer to engineer oh my

419
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:37,469
from you that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of</font>

it's between me and the attackers and

422
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:42,829
that's what I personally think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

423
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:45,000
way to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to work on attacks</font>

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,849
certain aspects of how outages are

438
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,150
handled how how large-scale dishes

439
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:26,879
happened how shared space like maize and

440
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,010
naps go down for problems go down for

441
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintenance and not everybody knows at</font>

442
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,740
once I also recognize the fact that

443
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,990
every time somebody posted a list of

444
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,630
summer football addresses to manic I saw

445

our<font color="#CCCCCC"> smurf attacks spike massively but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

446
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,169
also saw a lot of those networks get

447
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,509
closed down so

448
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,799
I can't absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> promise that this</font>

449
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:48,659
information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be secure I</font>

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't actually even expect people to be</font>

452
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,869
start out I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a forum</font>

453
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:56,999
where we can gradually move towards some

454
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:59,399
way of sharing information without

455
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:01,139
completely tanking ourselves and whether

456
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means changing the entire paradigm</font>

457
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:06,090
so that when outage reports go out into

458
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:07,799
the world even if they do end up on the

459
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,519

give you all the experiences I had with

you

492
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,830
I think the ability to try to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

certainly on the trust side of things to

other I think my question mainly is

499
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:54,100
focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how much how do you go about</font>

who so that you still have useful

information flowing back and forth so

503

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have somebody taking a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you anything about handling that I think</font>

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,510
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel comfortable dictating to</font>

558
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,379
if it doesn't work I think the other

559
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,580
thing you'd be careful about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to make</font>

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,700
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't have a membership</font>

allows people and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got at the bar</font>

563
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,049
sort of this high and then once a

564
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:35,210
certain set of providers are in they all

565
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:37,418
vote to raise the bar way up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

566
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,640
you exclude a large portion of

567
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:43,220
potentially valuable other participants

568
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,140
I've seen that happen in some membership

569
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,540
organizations elsewhere I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it</font>

570
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,299
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and honestly I know that</font>

571
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:53,178
there's an overall not so fun feeling

572
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:55,490
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I ops I recognize the</font>

573
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,380
pain of exclusionary situations but I

574
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,940
and I also recognize the tragedy of the

575
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,860
comments if you have just<font color="#CCCCCC"> too many</font>

576
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,809
people participating and it turns into a

577
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,790
