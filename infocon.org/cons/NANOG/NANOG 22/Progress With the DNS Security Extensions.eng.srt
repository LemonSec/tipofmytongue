had a visit<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the fire marshal this</font>

morning and he or she is very concerned

<font color="#CCCCCC">about people sitting on the stairs out</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is those sitting on the stairs</font>

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:54,709
coming down so don't do that I put this

<font color="#CCCCCC">light up during the morning break and</font>

13

this program called<font color="#CCCCCC"> dese guess it's easy</font>

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,500
to find it's out there it's a tool that

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:19,860
looks for passwords and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was shocked to</font>

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,409
see how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords were just there</font>

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,659
to be grabbed out of the air at a

23
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,600
meaning of so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who should</font>

24

know better someone sitting in the

parking lot with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop and a wave</font>

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,008
land card can get this same data except

27
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,110
they also get the user names and the IP

28
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,570
addresses so they can read your mail

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,189
they can send me with you they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font>

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">in as you they can do whatever it was</font>

31
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:51,079
that you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing when your password</font>

33
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,449
I'm not here to embarrass anyone so I'm

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to publish the user names but</font>

anyone who finds and runs and installs d

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,130
sniffs will know much more than is on

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,860
this slide so be very careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

38
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,859
you do use encryption for everything

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:23,630
most people the question was<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are downloading it right</font>

42
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,220
now

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,170
ok

44
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:36,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay i'm here to talk about the progress</font>

going to give you really is this one

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,540
point it's a set of improvement to<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

49
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,190
to make it more secure to make it harder

50
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,600
to attack the dns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it harder</font>

51
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,720
for Dina to help you attack something

else in the past two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> there have</font>

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,150
been a bunch of hands-on workshops run

00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,560
on top of this technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to put</font>

in the shape to be used people<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

58
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,730
what's happened in the past basically in

59
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,489
the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year in terms of the workshops</font>

60
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,130
themselves and then the lessons learned

61
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:20,950
and the issues we still have remaining

62
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:26,219
they've come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those workshops not</font>

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,219
used to IBM or<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows page</font>

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:36,210
computers are lovely space are ok ok the

65
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,640
for a background is the end of security

66
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,700
I gave a presentation last summer intern

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,659
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanigen in Albuquerque and the link</font>

68
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,400
is up there if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that</font>

69
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">workshops seem to be somewhat fairly</font>

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,890
unique in the IHF process one of the

71
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,230
unusual things here that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> dnf security</font>

72
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,090
we only have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> codebase Willy to work</font>

73
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,520
from we have a few partial<font color="#E5E5E5"> fomentations</font>

74
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,659
but only one real implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,280
with the idea being about

76
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,100
interoperability it's hard we only have

77
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">one thing doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something so to help the</font>

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and look at the</font>

80
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,270

81
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built and see if we like what's</font>

82
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,919
specified if we like the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,080
on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple of objectives of</font>

84
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,630
the workshops number one is education to

85
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,750
get the idea get what dns effective is

86
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,280
about out into the community that's

87
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,440
somewhat important but the ITF really is

88
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,299
about the education what we're really

89
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,270
after is testing the specification in

90
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software that we have we're putting</font>

91
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,419
out there we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show the</font>

92
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,830
specification is correct so that when

93
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,159
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next round</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of implementations come</font>

94
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,330
around everything will interoperate and

95
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,310
probably the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to</font>

96
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:49,020
be examined here is the inner the

97
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:51,600
inter-zonal illustration interface there

98
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,280
is a lot of interaction has to be set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,250
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the management of one part of a</font>

money you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a name you're given and</font>

103
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,080
you set up your<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS now you like to have</font>

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,640
to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth of your parent and</font>

105
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,240
with other places to make sure that

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,349
security works correctly now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the more recent</font>

108

workshops this isn't all of them this

109
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,869
was just the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the last time I</font>

110
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,270
talked at nanog put this up here to give

111
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,430
you an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of the spread geographically</font>

113
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,200
the how often they've occurred in the

114
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,220
past year<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about their six here about</font>

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> highlights that's come out of this</font>

117
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,880
work is the startling realization of DNS

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,860
SEC isn't just one thing it seems kind

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,630
of obvious we look at the way where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

120
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,360
are now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't obvious when we</font>

121
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,569
started out DNS SEC really has a bunch

122
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,550
of

123
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,289
opponents some of them are ready to be

124
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,969
used some are not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

125
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,979
and we're being<font color="#E5E5E5"> to separate that in the</font>

126
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:51,599
workshop at least try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and document the</font>

127
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,219
ones that are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> mature in one way and</font>

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,110
ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need more work we spend more</font>

129
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:59,699
time on we are making<font color="#CCCCCC"> progress on the</font>

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the interface between the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parent and</font>

good news here is that although we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

134
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,229
have we haven't set up the answer of how

135
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:11,819
to do it we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a lot of input</font>

from a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> places not just</font>

one or two people back and forth arguing

over something I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can up at</font>

consists of about 24 people coming in to

is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can augment the root zone with our</font>

162
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:12,329
set that up because we don't know

exactly who's going to attend the day of

had a HTML set up a web web interface

they'll get teased go up and down<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

200
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,320
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at times there's you want</font>

201
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,569
to be able to check signatures going

208
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:05,070
and finally got the written into stone

209
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,339
there I guess afternoon on 20 which was

210
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,690
back in Washington DC about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

211
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,610
we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-day workshop which we</font>

212
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,610
modeled on the Swedish workshop we tried

213
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,450
to follow as much but within one day and

214
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,709
difference here is we actually had

215
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,540
homework assignments brought to all the

216
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,890
attendees that<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed up they had they</font>

217
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,770
were told ahead of time what they had to

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dell had to configure on the machines we</font>

has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented since then at the</font>

49th IETF we had a workshop that

233
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,859
became aware that vase exchanging we

243
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,740
the network and finally one thing that

244
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,780
came up there was the desire the

245

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,890
before we had a lot of interest from

285
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,360
different places and discussions and a

286
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:14,530
lot of that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming now from operators</font>

287
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:16,960
and not from<font color="#E5E5E5"> theorists say we've got one</font>

288
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the the bottom point I have there is</font>

289
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,560
that there have been a lot of seeds we

290
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,750
made earlier in the implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

291
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,060
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> specification that we're getting</font>

292
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,230
better input on

293
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,089
now back when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote the specs</font>

294
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,500
originally as most people who thought

295
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,840
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would work one way you didn't have</font>

296
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,760
a lot of hands-on experience and so now

297
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,500
we're getting a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more input from real</font>

298
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,160
experts who know how to run a network to

299
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,770
help us finish off the specs the value

300
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the heat distribution feature is</font>

301
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,750
becoming more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more apparent besides</font>

and it's been found<font color="#E5E5E5"> by some people</font>

307
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,660
that's a feature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> storing keys and</font>

308
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:04,070
securing this information has a lot more

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">value than just a secure infrastructure</font>

310
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,610
we're also getting better implementation

311
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,569
we're testing more the buying software

312
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,990
which is kind of the reference

313
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:15,900
limitation at a time we're beginning to

314
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,090
get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> better place we're still in the</font>

315
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,980
situation though the DNS soft<font color="#CCCCCC"> dnf</font>

316
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,900
security software is still bleeding edge

317
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,360
we're still playing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of some of</font>

318
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:29,310
the issues with software definitely

319
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:31,560
going to lag in some places issues I

320
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,229
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a start issues one of the big</font>

321
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,239
issues now is when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zone and</font>

322
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">used to sign the zone with a public with</font>

323
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,220
a public/private key pair your public

324
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,560
key has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be signed by essentially the</font>

325
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,000
parent so that if I'm building a secure

326
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,729
tree I can see from the parent that you

327
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,680
are the legal owner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that zone the</font>

328
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,960
issue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have here is where does</font>

329
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> proof of ownership reside that</font>

330
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,860
prove ownership is actually a signature

331
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,530
record the parent takes your key signs

332
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,890
it put the signature in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cigar and</font>

333
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:04,319
place it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS the specification</font>

334

says that it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a parent with a</font>

more the operational work we<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize</font>

338
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it makes more sense with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parent</font>

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,780
to put this out than the child what

we're not done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the debate yet we</font>

341
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,850
don't know if that's the right place to

342
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,439
do things so we have one issue that

343
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to be resolved this one is getting</font>

344
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:30,210
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention the keys for other</font>

uses application<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys has come up in DNS</font>

346
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,070
there is one overriding issue which i

347
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,360
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have reflected here is</font>

348
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,010
that whether or not this even belongs in

349
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">dns</font>

350
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,280
there have been some debates about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

351
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS should hold just dns information</font>

352
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,230
or whether should be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for any kind</font>

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,960
of information assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,800
application keys inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS the question</font>

355
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,120
is where do they go one of the looking

356
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the previous issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we talked</font>

357
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,580
about the parent signature of keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

358
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,010
the child's own it jumped into a

359
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,920
discussion about what if I have my eight

360
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,470
my zone apex in my zone is used like a

361
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,290
host like I have HTTP colon slash slash

362
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,380
my domain name without the www in front

363
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,560
of it I might have ipsec keys for that

364
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,760
host i might have ssh keys to that host

365
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,290
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the same place as my</font>

366
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,920
zone keys so that means the parent would

367
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,120
then have to sign them and that why do I

368
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,550
was seeing is an issue we don't want to

369
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,070
have a parent signing host information

370
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,890
for the app for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the child so we're</font>

371
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,290
looking at ways of where to put the

372
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:36,080
application fees the other issues I have

373
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,880
there is subtyping meaning that when you

374
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,020
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a resource record out of DNS you</font>

375
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,910
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into the resource</font>

376
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,680
record to figure out is this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of many</font>

377
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,540
that I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

378
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the resource records of the</font>

379
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,890
set and the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the message refers</font>

380
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:53,329
to having to add too many keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

381
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:57,410
an answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won the issue that came up</font>

382
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:59,420
after the the IETF workshop and in San

383
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,000
Diego had to do with how do we

384
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,839
persistently test DNS SEC or for that

385
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,329
matter any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> additions to dns and as</font>

386
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,980
far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NS neck is concerned we want</font>

387
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,169
to have a persistent test environment

388
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,510
because setting up DNS SEC from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

389
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,530
scratch it's somewhat complicated but it

390
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,589
can be done it's fairly straightforward

391
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,000
it takes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work though what makes</font>

392
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,609
it really hard is when changes occur

393
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,319
when I have to change my zone key how do

394
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:26,839
I talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a parent what happens on the</font>

395
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,610
parent chain is there's own key now this

396
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,050
kind of testing can't really be done

397
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,149
overnight we need to have some time to

398
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,700
let things sink in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the invite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

399
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the the implications of changing some of</font>

400
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,830
the DxO some of those data so we need to

401
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,000
have a bit more persistent way to look

402
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:46,909
at the engineering that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

403
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,250
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah that plus the comment event</font>

404
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,150
that we come at me before we have a fake

405
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,920
truth

406
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,050
for testing you've got an issue here

407
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,480
about making up where do we put this

408
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,830
test environment how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we how do we</font>

409
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,670
mimic a root system in an engineering

410
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:04,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can test now there's</font>

411
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:07,040
another another angle<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this need for</font>

412
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,990
persistence and that's there have been

413
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,780
some other research researchers looking

414
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:14,180
at how do I build a secure zone secure

415
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,720
dns which doesn't follow the tree itself

416
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build up other secure</font>

417
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,080
relationships with other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

418
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,720
the world to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you need more</font>

419
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,070
time to really build this up and so

420
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,000
another situation we want to have a more

421
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,340
persistent test environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue</font>

422
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,720
that's come up is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

423
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,480
thing called a lightweight resolver

424
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,060
demon which is part of vines latest

425
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,860
distribution by nine and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

426
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,220
taking the sub resolver replacing it

427
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,870

meeting a couple weeks ago involving

some some of the lawyers in Europe's

451
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,840
we've been looking at what does it mean

452
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,400
to deploy DNS SEC what's the legal

457
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,149

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,679
legal issue its international in scope

459
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,150

hasn't gotten a whole lot of discussion

now basically through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS EXT</font>

for questions

yeah two things first I want to take

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,970
issue with a word that you used use the

word improve so the DNS SEC is an

improvement to to DNS I will agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extension to the NS the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> second</font>

523
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:50,500
interest some people there probably will

be a bind 83 and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have</font>

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,910
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of DNS sex stripped out of it</font>

526
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,180
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is now doing more harm than</font>

527
00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:00,010
good it doesn't do validation it doesn't

528
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,650
do a number of things that by nine does

529
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,690
so it isn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of any</font>

530
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,370
interoperability experiments and it

531
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,560
doesn't really do anything useful but

532
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,659
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of cert advisories on</font>

534
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,100
stripping it out seems like a feature

535
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:30,090
simpler is better I had heard from some

536
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,800
folks who were involved with the bind9

537
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,300
tree in the development and there was a

538
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,940
statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> made by a nominal</font>

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:49,660
DNS SEC code is as you stated earlier in

543
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:56,860
a state of flux still does this bother

<font color="#CCCCCC">should take Paul's lead and just sort of</font>

547
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:12,400
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blind eye to DNS SEC I I don't</font>

548
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,439
think sighs<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's contractually the</font>

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,140
contract funding it is due up sometime

550
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,430
next few months but doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,320
there won't be any more work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and</font>

552
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:25,780
doesn't mean that it won't be more money

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,100
later on<font color="#CCCCCC"> sound for it but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

um I'm switching hats rapidly here as a

I guess a representative of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nom nom for</font>

558
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:49,860
this trip to the microphone i will say

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,929
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no plan in place for a</font>

working on by nine there are other

priorities there are funding questions

564
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,020
it turns out that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though there are</font>
