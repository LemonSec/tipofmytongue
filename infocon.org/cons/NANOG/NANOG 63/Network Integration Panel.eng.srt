this conversation that I believe we

really need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had several</font>

model<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's based around this concept</font>

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,920
of synergies which is this word that's

76
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,740
pretty dirty most of us associated with

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,870
lots of firings that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost</font>

78
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,930
synergies side and then there's also

79
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:32,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">revenue synergies or debt synergies in</font>

80
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,080
some cases basically it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> principal</font>

81
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,180
one plus one equals more than two and

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,240
it's the culmination of trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

83
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these models they</font>

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,120
aren't perfect when you do when you do

85
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,950
an acquisition sometimes depending on

86
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,320
the size of the entities you could have

87
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,800
say to really large dear ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

88
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,440
each other and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tier 1 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tier</font>

89
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,990
2 and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called a revenue</font>

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,150
synergy where you have customers that

91
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,190
are common across both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the companies</font>

92
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're buying both companies</font>

93
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,370
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want redundancy and so they</font>

94
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,110
get very concerned about initially

95
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,090
they're concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

96
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,500
resiliency but they could also be

97
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,190
concerned about something that's as

98
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,350
simple as just economic buying leverage

99
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,800
and economic consolidation and supplier

100
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,120
management so this almost almost right

101
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,920
away within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first month after</font>

102
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,590
acquisition one of the first things that

103
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,180
you encounter is a great one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

104
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,299
first barriers which is commercial

105
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,620
challenges to integration which is

106
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,300
customers that don't want you to touch

107
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,150
anything just yet they want to maintain

108
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,610
those separate networks for some time so

109
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,140
they have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> diversity so commercial</font>

110
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,340
challenges of that nature come out

111
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty quick res you had some thoughts</font>

112
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,109
there in terms of the growth effects

113
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,969
well so other thing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

114
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,130
people don't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font>

115
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,740
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reasons to do M&A work</font>

116
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,060
besides just you you see a company

117
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,100
that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit and you think there</font>

118
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,650
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be synergy's there's everything</font>

119
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,450
from essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying revenue you know</font>

120
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,270
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your next quarter look</font>

121
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,750
better if you can pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> revenue and</font>

122
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,880
you can really cover a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

123
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">business aspects by doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font>

124
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,590
people who have actually been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

125
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,200
successful at acquiring and using their

126
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,640
acquisition to get more debt leverage so

127
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,190
that they can go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and acquire more if</font>

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,659
you look historically at z 0 for example

129
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,650
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been masters of doing this</font>

130
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,169
there's there's all of these different

131
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:38,260
reasons that are not all around how do

132
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,090
we take two tier ones and mash<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

133
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,469
together but that's that's definitely an

134
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,539
interesting problem and that's one where

135
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,919
you really have people that they

136
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,229
previously bought from two different

137
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:51,340
carriers for a reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then that goes</font>

138
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:54,070
away but it can be anything from you

139
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,460
know buying a bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> network than you if</font>

140
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:00,490
you look at folks like SBC and AT&T you

141
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:03,460
can have a situation where an SBC buys

142
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,400
AT&T renames itself AT&T<font color="#CCCCCC"> and turns over</font>

143
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,880
the keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> to AT&T so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not always</font>

144
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:17,859
about who is the the buyer who is the

145
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:19,840
seller yeah the the you know sometimes

146
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,610
you don't actually wind up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

147
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,669
customers you think you bought sometimes

148
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:28,930
the the products don't fit or you you

149
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:33,070
have a problem selling the same product

150
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:36,550
even if it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same or or you know</font>

151
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:39,099
you're seeking to expand a footprint but

152
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,300
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you brought up with 18t gets back</font>

153
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:46,240
to some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the some of the culture and</font>

154
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,000
organizational concerns that sometimes

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,250
see and Steve I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had some</font>

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,500
concepts there in terms of the

157
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,760
organizational issues that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

158
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:01,210
worth the sharing sure um when I always

159
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,849
asked to attend this um symposium I had

160
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred hours worth of topics so</font>

161
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,320
and I actually boil this down to two you

162
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,560
know two main items that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

163
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,979
across which was the most important item

164
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">in my opinion for whether a acquisition</font>

165
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:21,430
or merger<font color="#CCCCCC"> oriole union of two a pre</font>

166
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually will work is</font>

167
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,039
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

168
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:29,110
who gets the people lined up correctly

169
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:32,979
and there is no longer them and us but

170
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just us and in my experience where</font>

171
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,289
mergers and acquisitions have<font color="#E5E5E5"> failed is</font>

172
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,610
when the them and us was never replaced

173
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:44,078
with us because on that day even if it's

174
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,939
not your network and you do not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

175
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:48,550
expertise for it you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat</font>

176
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:50,199
everyone as your customer and that

177
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,469
doesn't I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> nots and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

178
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:57,160
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen so um that in my</font>

179
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">opinion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the most important item for</font>

180
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know for successful merger</font>

181
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:03,430
everything else whether it's clash of

182
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,959
cultures or disparate technologies it

183
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,800
doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you cannot get the</font>

184
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um on lined up and all motivated</font>

185
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,740
understand understanding in terms of

186
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,240
what their job is and where how the

187
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,240
organization should be you know

188
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,399
everything else does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter um the</font>

189
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,529
second item that i thought was and it

190
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,560
was important identify is when you have

191
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,579
a under you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a merger like this</font>

192
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,518
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be some type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

193
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:32,410
complexity you know it could be very

194
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">small let's say you're adding a unlike a</font>

195
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:38,290
disparate object on let's say one

196
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,569
company doesn't have a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit adding</font>

197
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,579
that video unit may be easier it may be

198
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:45,069
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult if you're emerging I GPS</font>

199
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:47,769
but regardless<font color="#CCCCCC"> on there is going to be</font>

200
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:50,949
some type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of complexity that you can</font>

201
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:54,430
quantify and someone has to deal with

202
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:56,170
that complexity oh and then what's most

203
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,109
important is someone at the top at the

204
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">strategic level has to decide which</font>

205
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,240
organizations are best capable for

206
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:06,279
handling at complexity and which ones

207
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,899
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know should do that and</font>

208
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,870
how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be divvied up so for</font>

209
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,910
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> what might make IT or systems</font>

210
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,100
job very easy might make<font color="#CCCCCC"> Engineering's</font>

211
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:19,569
job very difficult what might make plan

212
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,089
um um planning's job very easy might

213
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:24,579
make operations job very difficult but

214
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">regardless of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at it there's</font>

215
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,029
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be this would be something</font>

216
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:31,449
similar the uncertainty<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle who r</font>

217
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:35,199
that is a finite object and you cannot

218
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:36,279
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it go away so on the last item that</font>

219
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:39,519
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was in</font>

220
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,279
ortant is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

221
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,569
complexity in terms of making the merger

222
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,709
happen you know who wears the pain was a

223
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,259
good line that came out of that

224
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:53,768
conversation it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would it would be nice</font>

225
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:55,329
if somebody actually intentionally made

226
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:57,339
a decision about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which group would</font>

227
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:59,498
inherit that complexity but

228
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:03,639
unfortunately that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens more</font>

229
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:05,800
accidentally there's complexities<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets</font>

230
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,800
swept under the rug<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

231
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,079
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one group makes someone in</font>

232
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,180
a vacuum that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can inadvertently impact</font>

233
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,160
other groups in ways that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't</font>

234
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">forcing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or even talked about so I agree</font>

235
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,879
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be important but I don't know</font>

236
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:22,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens that much where where</font>

237
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:25,300
one group really makes that call I in

238
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:28,749
the organizations that I've been in the

239
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,359
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> decade plus we kind of think of the</font>

240
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">company and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the big moving parts is a</font>

241
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,699
three-legged stool you've got

242
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,029
engineering as one leg of the stool the

243
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:41,378
network as the second you've got IT and

244
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:47,230
it's the third you've got product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

245
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:51,550
marketing and this panel is how not to

246
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:53,170
complete an integral we have any more

247
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,910
things they say about organization the

248
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,680
inner<font color="#CCCCCC"> workings between those three</font>

249
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,329
groups are incredibly important the

250
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,339
amount of collaboration that has to

251
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:02,638
occur across those organizations is

252
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:05,920
paramount to making any progress at all

253
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,620
otherwise you can easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into a set</font>

254
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,439
of circling interdependencies between

255
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:14,319
the three teams where the network team

256
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:16,449
thinks that well if the product group

257
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:18,849
can figure out how to rationalize the

258
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:21,008
products then we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> XY and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Z</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

259
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and the product team is thinking</font>

260
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:25,809
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> t can figure out how to take my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">rationalized product that i have and</font>

262
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,709
build it into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems so that</font>

263
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,600
everything everything works together

264
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:34,119
regardless of the network then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be</font>

265
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,860
all set and the IT organization is

266
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,300
thinking you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if those network guys</font>

267
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,850
can ever make any progress with

268
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,040
combining the network's my job<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the IT</font>

269
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,120
side would be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

270
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,559
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's doing anything</font>

271
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,920
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're waiting for someone else</font>

272
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">they get something done but in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

273
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,300
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

274
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">i T has the most important set of tasks</font>

275
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,399
to complete in order to enable the rest

276
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,820
of the organization to function and make

277
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:03,220
progress and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're struggling at all</font>

278
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,649
on the IT side is going to thwart all of

279
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,230
your plans to make any progress yeah

280
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,630
well it's a you know the building has to

281
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,130
happen have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have customers get billed</font>

282
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:18,040
you have to get the money in the the

283
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:21,420
backend integration<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep go but jump on</font>

284
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,760
in man no you say that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hit</font>

285
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,860
continuing on that train of thought you

286
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they do have to kind of work in</font>

287
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:33,370
conjunction though because if you don't

288
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:37,899
have the same set of products it's hard

289
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:40,470
to migrate or integrate networks so you

290
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:43,600
know we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> situations where</font>

291
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,820
nothing's been decided and you end up

292
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,370
having just continuing with the status

293
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:52,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">quo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is no actual integration</font>

294
00:13:48,370 --> 00:14:00,670
than ships in the night sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

295
00:13:52,089 --> 00:14:06,610
operation exactly yeah so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

296
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:08,860
the horizontal this I come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

297
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought because the the</font>

298
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,760
product pointed come up when we were

299
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,099
having the conversation before and you

300
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,130
had 0 is gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back end</font>

301
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,350
stuff so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people when</font>

302
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,760
you get into into mas that there's some

303
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,440
companies that are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it they</font>

304
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,209
do this regularly they have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

305
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,399
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of companies who</font>

306
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:29,229
somehow find their way into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it either it</font>

307
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a very opportune time where they</font>

308
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,420
made a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell or buy a</font>

309
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,589
company they bought a distressed asset

310
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,360
but if you if you don't have this

311
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,790
process in place a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times it</font>

312
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,839
really goes south very quickly in the

313
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,469
integration of the back office

314
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,329
everything from the contract management

315
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,940
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sales rep integration to all</font>

316
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:52,000
of that down to the billing so my

317
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:55,000
previous life at gtt when we bought Tina

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,680
the data network of intelligent that was

319
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,329
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our biggest challenges was just</font>

320
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,069
the back end the monitoring the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pulling</font>

321
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:01,599
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices not so much the polling</font>

322
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,740
of the devices but a little linking of

323
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,540
that data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

324
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,209
the constructs around that and we spent

325
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,219
months doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that was a huge thing</font>

326
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,630
that customers want the very first thing

327
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,600
they want when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about</font>

328
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,310
doing the integration is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we how</font>

329
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,770
do i buy service from both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you under</font>

330
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,000
one contract how do i mix and match even

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">if there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are two different networks with</font>

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,220
from this network in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frankfurt and add</font>

it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my contract and that's something</font>

336
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,550
that you really should<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever consider doing it may</font>

work as<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how is that going to work out</font>

339
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,079
the databases are a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more critical</font>

340
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:41,260
sometimes than you know arguing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

341
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,560
what protocols get used where I I guess

342
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:49,480
by way of offering some actual maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

343
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:51,489
advice during this during this panel I'm

344
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,130
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure how this works in most networks</font>

345
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,260
but the way our OSS system works is it

346
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,820
parses a standard description off the

347
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,220
interface we have standardized interface

348
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,440
descriptions so when the devices are

349
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,720
pulled that's parsed and then that's

350
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,610
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create the relational</font>

351
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,130
information along with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the records</font>

352
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the interface stats and so one of</font>

353
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,430
the things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that was</font>

354
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,160
able to provide a moderate level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

355
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:18,069
flexibility was by having all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

356
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,850
information off of the we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> went</font>

357
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:24,250
with the legacy legacy Global Crossing

358
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,980
OSS database and SNMP polling system

359
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,589
we're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to have that go collect</font>

360
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,750
information from the legacy level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

361
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,670
network and collect all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were</font>

362
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,790
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pick customers up and</font>

363
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:39,130
move them and because we were collecting

364
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:42,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">information it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of showing up in</font>

365
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,740
the OSS database exactly the way it

366
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,319
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have before before they were moved</font>

367
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,880
and so from a systems perspective the

368
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really had no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that the</font>

369
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,990
customer had been physically picked up

370
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:54,490
and moved which did something very

371
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,310
important for us it allowed us to

372
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,829
dealing dependencies in the migration

373
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:02,260
and every integration is going to have

374
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:03,459
an opportunity for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to create like I</font>

375
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,129
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's circling set of</font>

376
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:08,559
interdependencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime that you can</font>

377
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,410
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to delink things and let one</font>

378
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,359
group perform activities that make

379
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,310
progress towards integration without

380
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,959
impacting

381
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,270
groups you should find and seek<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

382
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,840
those opportunities and exploit them you

383
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:24,780
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any problem the aligning the</font>

384
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,929
standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those singer faces we</font>

385
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,970
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we used the the interface</font>

386
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,770
standard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was associated with the</font>

387
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,050
system stack that that customer was a

388
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,200
part of so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were to actually look</font>

389
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,480
at a you know a router you would find a

390
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,150
mix of interface description standards

391
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,830
you'd find legacy level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and legacy</font>

392
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,220
global crossing interface descriptions

393
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,500
on that device just flexibility being

394
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:56,160
the key to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually making progress</font>

395
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:59,400
mm-hmm you know that it was a there's a

396
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,590
host<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backend prompts we we could</font>

397
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,450
spend a lot of time on but the

398
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:11,970
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had earlier also touched</font>

399
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:16,500
on the wonderful world of<font color="#E5E5E5"> IC beads and</font>

400
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,980
and fun with BPM I don't know if Steve

401
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,740
have wanted to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of its a</font>

402
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,450
point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be came across it should all</font>

403
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,100
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that was it was</font>

404
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,160
interesting that I've observed is that

405
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,320
when you hit is migrating is almost

406
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,370
almost not that I'm a coder but I just

407
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember this from high school</font>

408
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,649
programming class I spend fifteen

409
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,750
percent of my time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 85 ninety-five</font>

410
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent of the problem and then the rest</font>

411
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,550
of the eighty-five percent of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

412
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:47,940
that on those exceptions and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

413
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,770
interesting items is it seems that I see

414
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,600
the same thing with migrations and that

415
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,970
it's never the standard products<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

416
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,520
are ever particularly difficult to

417
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,950
migrate what always<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

418
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,550
stumbling block for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> in for a generic</font>

419
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:06,060
migration are the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> exceptions so</font>

420
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:09,060
I what I've observed is that these

421
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:12,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">network exceptions are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are more</font>

422
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,850
likely to on delay or even potentially

423
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,450
two feet a migration because they are an

424
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:20,610
exception and they aren't necessarily

425
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,940
documented and standardized or in the I

426
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,360
guess we'll call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the company memory</font>

427
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,100
so you know and what end so with the

428
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,500
larger the

429
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">bini is more likely you're going to have</font>

430
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,010
those exceptions just because you're

431
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:37,100
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have large customers who may be</font>

432
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:38,690
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage their size to enforce</font>

433
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,500
let's say something that is outside of

um if you do have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure because they</font>

are on the large customers are most

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,049
have a greater opportunity to

potentially discourage you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

440
00:19:54,049 --> 00:20:02,120
migrations as an example for the last

441
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:06,049
time we migrated a router from a PE from

442
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:10,699
a s 1 / 2 a-s 3549 which is where we

443
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:13,639
were VPN products live the first I don't

444
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,100
know 600<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers on the device to 15</font>

00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:21,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes and the last five customers took</font>

446
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:23,330
three hours and it's it's not just with

447
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,010
them large companies you have to worry

448
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,418
about that sometimes a small company if

449
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,470
you're buying that one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

450
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:32,150
they've had to do as a small company

451
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:33,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's bend over to the whims of a</font>

452
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,169
significant customer and they may have

453
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,289
you know maybe making all the money on

454
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:42,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">some ICP so maybe only I see depending</font>

456
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,299
product strategy some companies are

457
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:51,020
designed from the ground up to be a more

458
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:53,240
rigid product that doesn't lend its way

459
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,668
to flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whatnot and that</font>

460
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,470
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if your marketing</font>

461
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,809
strategy was to target more the small to

462
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">medium</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> size business and if you're</font>

463
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:05,450
targeting larger enterprises they have

464
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,760
they have more unique needs and so you

465
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to provide flexibility in terms of</font>

466
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,200
capabilities and you don't want to

467
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:13,460
productize every single one of those you

468
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,830
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make every single one of</font>

469
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,080
those commercial otherwise you'll never

470
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get them out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the door so you</font>

471
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,830
end up doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of customs or</font>

472
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,100
specials or I see bees or ever you want

473
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:27,220
to call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and the trick I guess</font>

474
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,168
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to document them better</font>

475
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,450
documentation over being over relying on

476
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:34,039
institutional memory but but when you're

477
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,049
when you're designing an integration

478
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,850
plan even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they were well documented</font>

479
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:38,759
you might know about you might know

480
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,248
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

481
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,529
but you you wouldn't necessarily be able

482
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:45,179
to build an engineering plan around all

483
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:46,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">this document at I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Seabees you would</font>

484
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,549
probably still have to handle them as

485
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:51,509
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> offs one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the downsides of you</font>

486
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:53,369
know when you're when you're buying a

487
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:55,079
distressed asset which in reality is

488
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,639
kind of with a forcing function for a

489
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,649
lot of companies to sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you you</font>

490
00:21:56,639 --> 00:22:00,508
either sell if you want out of the

491
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:02,968
business you're losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> money badly and</font>

492
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:04,709
you need something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve your problem</font>

493
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:06,989
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're highly successful you're about</font>

494
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:09,119
to make a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money and a lot of the</font>

495
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:10,409
times the the real motivation is that

496
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,869
there is a serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem there's</font>

497
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:14,190
people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving and then you as</font>

498
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:15,928
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do the acquisition that's</font>

499
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,209
another big turnover as soon as there's

500
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:19,799
a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a culture clash you start</font>

501
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:22,019
losing people and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> start losing that</font>

502
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,719
institutional memory so you know when

503
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:25,769
you're when you're doing your research

504
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:27,599
the very first thing you should look at

505
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:30,119
is how documented is this how easy is it

506
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,918
going to be to integrate and can we get

507
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,099
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who do know this to document</font>

508
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:39,599
it quickly yeah the due diligence phase

509
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:42,359
is kind of key well you you're looking

510
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:48,269
at a company there<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be more out there</font>

511
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:50,849
that you're unaware of so companies have

512
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:54,119
gone through many mas there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

513
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:58,279
other small pieces still lurking out

514
00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:01,069
there so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still have 50 plus</font>

515
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:04,739
autonomous systems still in use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

516
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:07,259
they're not all documented trying to

517
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:09,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentation or the right</font>

518
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:15,119
people who have that information is

519
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:17,129
difficult you're looking for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

520
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:23,458
people who still remain from those

521
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:25,198
legacy companies so you'd be wary yeah a

522
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:30,869
nice retention package sometimes it's a

523
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:33,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">good thing to cook up um no go ahead see</font>

524
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:36,899
ya just don't wait for me jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> on injury</font>

525
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:39,269
I'm too polite um I would you know what

526
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:41,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">other comment about about all of this is</font>

527
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:44,129
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also a moving target so</font>

528
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:45,299
even in the if everything is perfectly

529
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:46,949
documented

530
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,950
and you've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> all your due diligence</font>

531
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,080
because this target you know moves you

532
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,330
might be surprised by changes that you

533
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,789
know just occurred on a good example of

534
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,489
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we when we began migrating</font>

535
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:05,249
some of the VPN customers from a s1 to

536
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:07,950
s3 549 we had some complex customers who

537
00:24:05,249 --> 00:24:10,080
had multiple drain routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their VPN</font>

538
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,830
service and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden there</font>

539
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,869
traffic was going overseas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

540
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and unbeknownst</font>

541
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:20,158
to us a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new service head or</font>

542
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:25,350
special had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> added to this customer</font>

543
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:30,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">so these drain routes existed on on the</font>

544
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:32,248
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VPN on the s3 459 VPN product we</font>

545
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:34,980
had thought we had addressed this but it

546
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:37,109
did not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> no and we would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been fine</font>

547
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:41,659
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had done maybe this migration a</font>

548
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:43,559
month earlier but because additional

549
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:46,320
implementation had been provisioned for

550
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:48,330
this given customer what we thought was

551
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,480
our target head you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know moved forward</font>

552
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,039
and we had to adjust after the fact so

553
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,899
that's something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware of</font>

554
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,460
that that cycle he'll can get you know

555
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:01,889
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think you hit you hit you're</font>

556
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,109
on top of everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can move</font>

557
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:05,879
so quickly that you will still not

558
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:10,830
capture everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need for a</font>

559
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:12,178
seamless integration that also ties into

560
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,259
what we were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before about</font>

561
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:18,809
customer communications actually being a

562
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:22,049
really important element I think there

563
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:25,200
were some transparency comments that you

564
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,999
wanted to expand on so it's a one of the

565
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,450
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I noticed the most and doing</font>

566
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:32,429
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MNA work that I've done most</font>

567
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers really don't understand what's</font>

568
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:36,090
happening on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend and as mature</font>

569
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,950
as transparent as you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be send out</font>

570
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,689
notices you alert them of what's

571
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,429
happening they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

572
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,289
the Herculean efforts that you're going

573
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:45,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're completely reorganizing</font>

574
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:47,279
the structure of two companies and you

575
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:49,440
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accommodate for what were the</font>

576
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,119
legacy processes how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we teach and</font>

577
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,149
train and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is up</font>

578
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,470
to the standards on those even things

579
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:58,439
like billing integration network

580
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,190
integration it's ultimately what you're

581
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,370
hoping for

582
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,870
is to take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two best technologies</font>

583
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,459
and and come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

584
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,860
and a lot of times what you get is you

585
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,580
take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two problem sets and you you</font>

586
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,649
amplify those so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

587
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,860
communication should be as thorough and

588
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,020
as cohesive as possible but you're still

589
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to be against customers who</font>

590
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,470
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand what's happening</font>

591
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,900
why it's happening when it's happening

592
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,250
and you get rumor mills<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get people</font>

593
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,230
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is and isn't going to</font>

594
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,970
happen on the network integration but

595
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,770
when you're sending out an email you're

596
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,140
sending a very dumbed down very

597
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,330
simplified explanation of the reality

598
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:42,690
and the more detail you can put behind

599
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:45,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the better managing a integration</font>

have a standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> Grimm team that focuses</font>

focuses on migrating customers but what

612
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens is it falls down to salespeople</font>

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,910
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to salespeople</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

those communications with customers and

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,300
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> commissioned for managing this</font>

migration they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even get usually</font>

00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,159
the credit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a renewal most of the</font>

620
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:41,190
time so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't necessarily have the</font>

621
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,420
the loyalty of your sales folks on board

622
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,910
to help you with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult</font>

00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem so that is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a open</font>

624
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,050
problem that I would imagine hits every

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,780
single integration no matter what's

626
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,030
going on yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Morgan it's back</font>

627
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,410
to organizationally owning and having

628
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:59,100
good leadership at the top having

629
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:03,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone in like who's in charge of the</font>

630
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,550
deals being able to allocate program

631
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,950
management managers and actually be able

<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font>

633
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:14,539
or that the oversight itself is funded

634
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:16,459
in my experience I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

635
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:19,039
much how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you form that cohesive team</font>

636
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,870
so when I flew out here I flew on United

637
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,549
and I flew on an old continental plane

638
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,469
and they said thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much you're</font>

639
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:26,000
proud continental crew and like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

640
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">years has it been since this integration</font>

641
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,590
happened well if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

642
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,529
reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they act this way these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

643
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:35,059
separate unions that separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay scale</font>

644
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:37,610
separate contracts separate so they

645
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:39,500
still see themselves internally as two

646
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:41,000
different organizations and if you build

647
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,580
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that when you when you</font>

648
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,870
reorganize people yeah you've got sales

649
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,100
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain this</font>

650
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,928
but you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well have just</font>

651
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,158
changed their<font color="#CCCCCC"> commission plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

652
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:51,260
they're scared and confused and they're

653
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:53,840
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> not looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to voting</font>

654
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,490
a positive message so the more that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

655
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,709
can work<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization so that</font>

656
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,720
people really do integrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> are forced</font>

657
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,190
reorganize teams force people to

658
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,710
integrate the better off you'll be oh

659
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:07,250
it's back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and then point</font>

660
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:09,529
from from Steve getting getting

661
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:13,340
potentially disparate cultures to

662
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:15,169
combine and get on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same page yeah I</font>

663
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,168
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave your personality is just</font>

664
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:19,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">like overwhelming the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mic man I mean</font>

665
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:21,950
another interesting thing is that the

666
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:24,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">more time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes on the more</font>

667
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,980
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things become because</font>

668
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,260
different organizations may have still

669
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,789
have the identities but new people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

670
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,970
come into the company don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have</font>

671
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:37,129
the history so we know when you don't

672
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,480
integrate all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your systems and you</font>

673
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,760
still have separate products and

674
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,010
customers have a real business need to

675
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">land in a very specific place on the</font>

676
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,570
network in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make their their</font>

677
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,939
network function that means that that

678
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:52,100
the order has to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legacy</font>

679
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,740
systems associated with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

680
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,529
asset and therefore the poor that

681
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,659
product has to be quoted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we've</font>

682
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:02,330
done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and help make</font>

683
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:04,820
this easier by asking questions like is

684
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,039
your customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> former like legacy level</font>

685
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">three or former legacy global crossing</font>

686
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,720
and imagine a sales person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that came in</font>

687
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,510
just six months ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting trained up</font>

688
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,730
and they they look at this questionnaire

689
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,590
and they have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the history</font>

690
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of their customer is and they scratch</font>

691
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,800
their head<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go</font>

692
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,840
legacy level 3 i'm pretty sure off you

693
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,850
go to the races<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the custom</font>

694
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,439
report ends up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong network and</font>

695
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:34,230
you have to reprovision it down the road

696
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:36,060
so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tip it over to took</font>

697
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,830
questions because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> come went over from</font>

698
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:41,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business goals down to the customer</font>

699
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:45,330
selves but you want to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything that</font>

700
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:47,040
we didn't hit yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay guys i'd say</font>

701
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,590
something about the network side of the

702
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,480
integration one thing to really<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep in</font>

703
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,689
mind especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a large</font>

704
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,040
network multinational network when

705
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,900
you're dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with customers who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

706
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,300
multiple locations it is incredibly

707
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,480
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do those integrations so I</font>

708
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally got burned when level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 in</font>

709
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,550
global crossing did a migration where

710
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,350
they without you know poor poor

711
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,210
maintenance notice they converted a

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:24,180
broke a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any cast for a lot of</font>

718
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,870
customers you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

719
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">separately process what happens when</font>

720
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,659
you've got multi-location customers and

721
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,949
how are you going to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font>

722
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,240
those sometimes the only way to deal

723
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,880
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really is a customer by customer</font>

724
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,890
basis as opposed to the ones who are who

725
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:43,470
are single location enterprises who are

726
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:44,790
much much easier to deal with yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

727
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">think what was interesting about that is</font>

728
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,480
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the customer by</font>

729
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,180
customer what was ironic as we had our

730
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,190
discussion you know you know on prior to

731
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,310
you know this panel is there actually

732
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:59,430
was a solution to that but here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

733
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:01,620
perfect example of where that had<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

734
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:04,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">been communicated and that there was a</font>

735
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:07,919
way to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> partial migration or</font>

736
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:10,560
in this case a partial is merge so the

737
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,230
irony<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that was tremendous amount of</font>

738
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,810
work was done to assist customers in

739
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:19,320
doing na s merge but here was a case

740
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:21,450
where that was not communicated so you

741
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,000
know so that that particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> dirty tool</font>

742
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,130
was not you know implemented you know to

743
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,660
make that particular integration<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm</font>

744
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,840
seamless when it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

745
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:34,460
we should file a patent on that is

746
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a pretty good piece of</font>

747
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering work that allowed a port on</font>

748
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,740
a customer's network to reside on one of

749
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,570
the backbones while all the other ports

750
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,020
were on the other network and despite

751
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:50,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that there was you know no</font>

752
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:51,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">geographic alignment across the the</font>

753
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">ports meaning you know you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

754
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,040
one port that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just in Miami and then</font>

755
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,170
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ports would be spread all</font>

756
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,180
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States or the US and</font>

757
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:03,140
Europe and the network would still

758
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:05,840
choose the longer a s path because there

759
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,330
was a like a partial<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> merge that was</font>

760
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,510
taking place and still choose the the

761
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:13,639
quicker path rather than using the

762
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,370
shortest<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS pass so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a good</font>

763
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,010
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of engineering work that held</font>

764
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:22,449
should when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's implemented correctly</font>

765
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:24,530
help situations like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> gtt had or</font>

766
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,110
hurricane we also did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

767
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:31,100
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to do a little</font>

768
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:32,990
better planning but you got to think on

769
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,850
your feet sometimes oh yeah oh yeah

770
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,190
could it be flexible McGee well

771
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,399
sometimes integration is actually kind

772
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:44,240
of the easy part getting everybody on

773
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,840
board<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new merged company as</font>

774
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,180
another factor so you have people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

775
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,120
are used to working only on you know one

776
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s and they're familiar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that you</font>

777
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,250
start integrating and they still want to

778
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:01,100
stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their little silo and don't want</font>

779
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:03,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know they've been cross trained</font>

780
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it had been cross grain but</font>

781
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,610
they don't necessarily want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out</font>

782
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,710
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their comfort zone exactly so you</font>

783
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:13,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you need to make sure everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

784
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:16,940
involved and<font color="#CCCCCC"> onboard you know you've got</font>

785
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:19,850
provisioning people who their workloads

786
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:22,190
been doubled but you know all the

787
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:25,000
migrations that need to occur moving

788
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:28,070
customers from one network to another

789
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,210
you've got integration happening in

790
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:35,630
other areas merging<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP and people still</font>

791
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,070
want to stay in their little area so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

792
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,260
have to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure those people who do</font>

793
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,060
get cross trained actually work in the

794
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,500
new area it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

795
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a rotation like the old</font>

796
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,899
the old deck business model of having

797
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,010
the staff rotation between dev and

798
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,600
operations well one thing I've noticed

799
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,340
about engineers is we're all smart

800
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,960
people but we all like to be smart

801
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,780
people we don't like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> admit that were</font>

802
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,400
dumb and Donna what I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that</font>

803
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,750
was the prime motivating factor for

804
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,890
people who didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get outside of</font>

805
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,750
their comfort zone was they didn't want

806
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask a question look stupid it's like</font>

807
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,930
oh no I actually have to learn something

808
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've been doing this for 20 years what</font>

809
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:11,359
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn something</font>

810
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:16,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to kick it over to like this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">nanog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 63 for QA you know if you have any</font>

812
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:22,549
questions comments technical business or

813
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,250
otherwise like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we kind of avoided</font>

814
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:29,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the generic argue over I GPS but if</font>

815
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:32,540
you have a thought come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> up I got some</font>

816
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,610
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for questions or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could just keep</font>

817
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,520
rambling or phase into the war story

818
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:47,180
part of the of the program

819
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:51,230
I see no one at microphones will let you

820
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:53,660
heckle our bad network integrations no

821
00:35:51,230 --> 00:36:03,200
one really that means there must be some

822
00:35:53,660 --> 00:36:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">people missing from this room I mean</font>

823
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:10,930
alrighty guys thanks for coming up and

824
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,930
thanks everybody

825
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,170
you
