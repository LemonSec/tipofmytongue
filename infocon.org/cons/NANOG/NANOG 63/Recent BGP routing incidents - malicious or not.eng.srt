1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,860
you

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,380
okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is Andre junk</font>

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,180
I run a service called bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> moan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,419
where we look at all kinds of

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting bgp pants originally</font>

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,369
exchanges hijack salad stuff like that

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,380
so in this presentation we're going to

8
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:35,600
look at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the recent events that</font>

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,520
we've seen and try to see if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,890
fact malicious or just incidents

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
accident stuff like that so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,630
to look at a few events the first one is

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,649
hijacking for monetary gain and we'll

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,519
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin stuff</font>

15
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:55,820
they're using bgp ooh goodbye censorship

16
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:59,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">IP squatting by spammers how did you</font>

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:03,050
beat me use as a Ito slacker and if you

18
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:05,570
what I want let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the first one um</font>

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,908
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is supposedly the</font>

20
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,279
largest<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin farm in the United</font>

21
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,230
States somewhere in which state there

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">are literally thousands and thousands of</font>

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:19,910
of boards collecting bit points so there

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">nowadays you know dedicated data centers</font>

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,259
with dedicated hardware just just

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,290
collecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin just to show you that</font>

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,030
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money to be made that</font>

28
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:32,390
sometimes that's that goes wrong this is

29
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,750
a similar large<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin farm in Thailand</font>

30
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,760
that unfortunately went up in flames

31
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,680
supposedly they weren't in church but it

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,440
does show that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people do invest</font>

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,800
heavily in buying hardware setup data

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,210
centers stuff like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of us</font>

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,240
or if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Bitcoin</font>

36
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,979
mining probably don't have that any step

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,960
what we do is we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use about</font>

38
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,850
resources right use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon or gate whoa</font>

39
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,100
digitalocean whatever you're used to um

40
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,490
so that's sort of where this story

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,589
starts so the way Bitcoin works is when

42
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:11,540
a Bitcoin miner comes online it

43
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:14,150
registers itself but a bit point sort of

44
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">group server and never protocol is just</font>

45
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,470
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of JSON messages that go back</font>

46
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,450
and forth where you get jobs you get

47
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,890
your rewards from but the server can

48
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:26,209
also redirect you to another<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

49
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:29,529
server for load balancing purposes so if

50
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:31,690
you do not have thousands of dollars

51
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,760
worth of hardware or willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend it</font>

52
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,590
on about resources if you can somehow

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,160
get access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pool server you and</font>

54
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,020
you get all the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jobs and and you</font>

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,850
talk to all these servers then you have

56
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,280
potentially access to a lot of but

57
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,440
giving resources and that's exactly what

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,060
happened with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this attack so this was</font>

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,130
originally published and detected by the

60
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,560
guy said<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dell SecureWorks and they have</font>

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,620
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good report explaining how this</font>

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,980
worked but what happened was some of

63
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,620
these these pool service run in OVH and

64
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,530
digital ocean amazon all the typical

65
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,830
about computing resources and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

66
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:15,220
happened is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker which Ida</font>

67
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:19,090
was a Canadian<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be or he had access at</font>

68
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,519
a router or disconnect is be announced

69
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,190
more specific sliced twenty-fours for

70
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,030
several of these amazon digital ocean

71
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,609
etc blocks then set up a server

72
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,120
listening to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP addresses that</font>

73
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,410
supposedly were these bull servers only

74
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,200
did it for a few minutes but it was

75
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,269
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Bitcoin miners to</font>

76
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,250
talk to him he then initiated they

77
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,049
redirect saying okay I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to low</font>

78
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">bounce you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another server to his</font>

79
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,530
server that he controlled and now the

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,828
Bitcoin miners are sort of sticky to

81
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,870
that server they collected all these or

82
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,060
they were generating bit points or

83
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,120
finding the the magic algorithm whatever

84
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,340
how it works exactly but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were never</font>

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,600
getting any rewards for it and said he

86
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,400
was keeping the rewards so it's

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,070
interesting that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hijacks are fairly</font>

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,109
short in duration but because he was

89
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,600
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> redirect them to another server</font>

90
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:17,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minus would get stick</font>

91
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,659
use that server for long I<font color="#CCCCCC"> um there were</font>

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,080
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of providers that were affected</font>

93
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,479
by this obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very advanced</font>

94
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,060
targeted attack but also interesting

95
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,940
because it wasn't just like you know i'm

96
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to originate this new / 24 and</font>

97
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">setup server he was also trying to</font>

98
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">actively hide himself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was using I</font>

99
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,659
guess technology both or technique both

100
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,909
is polluting this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a s</font>

101
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:45,159
both prepending and at time she could

102
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,980
you see if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the</font>

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,720
rightmost<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> das buff which is normally</font>

104
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,700
the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you could actually</font>

105
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,550
sometimes see like he was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

106
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon or just a range of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a SNS that</font>

107
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,970
were totally unrelated but if you looked

108
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,280
a little bit closer you could see that

109
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:05,260
there was always one ASM that was in

110
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:07,390
common<font color="#CCCCCC"> which was this ad n</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a s so the</font>

111
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,030
guy said<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dell SecureWorks estimate that</font>

112
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,030
about 83,000 dollars worth of bitcoins

113
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,359
for stolen this way um looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:20,049

115
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,830
still a bit limited to only yours at the

116
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Toronto internet exchange right because</font>

117
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">we only saw the announcement via peers</font>

118
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,390
of this network on the töricht so that

119
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,930
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know it still is a fairly</font>

120
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,820
large exchange so still lots of people

121
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> affected by this if you look</font>

125
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,099
OVH digitalocean eat swap etc so

126
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:55,000
definitely I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

127
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,500
started interesting even though

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously he was typically only</font>

129
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,840
interested in one or two blocks out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

130
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,700
that / 24 ste these blocks are typically

131
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,739
announced this larger blog so especially

132
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:10,450
amazon and answers like large chunks

133
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,190
like slice 1815 if you have an a prefix

134
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happened to be in that same same</font>

135
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,419
size 24 that would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been affected as</font>

136
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:22,150
well so there was some lateral damage

137
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:24,159
well um another thing so Jeff just

138
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,830
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how DNS can be used to</font>

139
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,100
bypass censorship so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a perfect</font>

140
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,560
example of that in the spring of last

141
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,270
year the<font color="#E5E5E5"> turkish President ordered there</font>

142
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,520
were elections and it was stuff on

143
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:40,090
YouTube and Twitter that that he didn't

144
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,039
want I guess the to see so he ordered

145
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,810
that to be blocked<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's different</font>

146
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,390
ways of doing that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case they</font>

147
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,610
decided to do it on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS level and</font>

148
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,250
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly pictures like this show</font>

149
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:56,020
up in the news and people had found a

150
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,770
way around the censorship so you saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> 888</font>

151
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,229
being sprayed

152
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,878
spray-painted on balls bus stops and

153
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:06,360
stuff like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were now all</font>

154
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:10,720
of a sudden able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around this this</font>

155
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:14,259
censorship so everybody happy except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

156
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,940
the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> so at that point they</font>

157
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:23,490
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II the addresses of</font>

158
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,449
these popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> open dns resolvers so</font>

159
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,720
addresses that were being<font color="#E5E5E5"> over audit</font>

160
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:30,159
were these 888 Google's opendns level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

161
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,800
open resolvers who are all affected by

162
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">this but the initial no route was</font>

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,060
actually very short in duration because

164
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem was they broke the whole</font>

165
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,470
internet or everyone in Turkey or at

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,509
least everyone uses this so they because

167
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,069
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the internet or the DNS is</font>

168
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,039
broken you know it's like it that's

169
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:51,449
broken but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously so they undid that</font>

170
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:55,090
and but a day later they did it again

171
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:57,909
they inserted a new router / 32 routes

172
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,159
for these popular DNS services and now

173
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:02,740
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a DNS server with those addresses</font>

174
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:07,750
and we're actively intercepting and

175
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:11,229
rewriting bust so at that point we could

176
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:14,169
see for example opendns significantly

177
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:18,219
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> arps and drop in traffic from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Turkey for one or two days scaring Lee</font>

179
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:23,169
enough the service still seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

180
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,419

181
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,520
thinking talking to google or opendns

182
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,859
they were in fact talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a server by</font>

183
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,529
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> turkish government so this is an</font>

184
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,130
example of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> turk telekom looking</font>

185
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:39,159
glass at that point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we requested the</font>

186
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,649
route 88 and what you can see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

187
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">would expect is a / 24 with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google's</font>

188
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:47,170
origin asn but in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

189
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:48,489
seeing is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> slice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 32 and EAS boss empty</font>

190
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,290
it's an internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes that they are</font>

191
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,110
originating this route and now

192
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,180
redirecting it to a server<font color="#E5E5E5"> day pro and</font>

193
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,020
similar routes similar routes were

194
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:02,589
visible for opened innocent love three

195
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:06,160
so if you then did a dig from<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

196
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:08,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Turkey we use this we used ripe Atlas to</font>

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube the arm up using 888 from</font>

200
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">within Turkey and this is the address</font>

201
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,569
that you got back the money in orange

202
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,640
which is a server controlled by<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

203
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,440
telecom and interestingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter was</font>

204
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,020
pointing to the same address at that as

205
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,090
well and in green is something you would

206
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,560
expect see so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another example</font>

207
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,290
how we can use how people are using

208
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,329
censorship our bgp to apply censorship

209
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:44,260
set up a new server that they control

210
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:49,330
and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it do whatever you want basically</font>

211
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:52,240
um so one more one other example is IP

212
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:55,510
squatting so I think it's long been

213
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,690
known and assumed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> spammer shoes I'd</font>

214
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,939
be squatting to to basically send spam

215
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,740
so their biggest problem is obviously we

216
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,380
need clean addresses addresses that did

217
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,180
not end up on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> blacklist yet when she</font>

218
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,160
starts and expand it will take few hours

219
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then and it's there and then you can</font>

220
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,110
do it anymore or at least you're not as

221
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,300
effective so the theory is that you use

222
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,380
unannounced address space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even</font>

223
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,329
though we're running out of address

224
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,850
space or ipv4 outer space there's still

225
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,160
large chunks of the IP space that are

226
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,220
unused if you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> find those and</font>

227
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,100
announce them and you you know send spam

228
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,660
from those you're virtually untraceable

229
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:36,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just rinse and repeat that</font>

230
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,900
over and over again so we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got some</font>

231
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,410
emails from people who use<font color="#E5E5E5"> our service</font>

232
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:44,020
and saying hey I've noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my my</font>

233
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,990
address has been announced<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and now</font>

234
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some spam blacklist after the</font>

235
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,610
second email we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look into this</font>

236
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,160
a little bit closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these users and</font>

237
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,480
found some interesting patterns so one

238
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,750
of the ways you can detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

239
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,150
operations is to just run some top 10 or

240
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,210
top 20 list of people who originated new

241
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:06,010
prefixes every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day so you know</font>

242
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,780
depending on the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network run</font>

243
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,330
if you're small provider you probably

244
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,760
originated I don't know wanted you to

245
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,380
prefix it's pure medium provider you

246
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,210
probably originated one to two new

247
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,080
prefixes a month if your large you do a

248
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:22,270
handful of day but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do originate</font>

249
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,490
several new dozen or so new prefixes

250
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,020
each day like these guys are doing

251
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,350
that's very suspicious so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily</font>

252
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,720
break that list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> find that so we did</font>

253
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,070
that create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> top 20 list and just</font>

254
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,990
eyeball it and say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's levels vary</font>

255
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">entity bunch of details mitigation</font>

256
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,740
providers that easily stand out but

257
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,899
whatever remains<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sort of you know</font>

258
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide us we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really heard of</font>

259
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,040
and and so it's kind of weird they were

260
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,649
announcing new space every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day</font>

261
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,160
over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out um so we start visualizing</font>

262
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,890
some of that and this is a screenshot

263
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,500
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool called ripe stat where you can</font>

264
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,630
just provide it with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn and it shows</font>

265
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,810
you the lifetime of each of the prefix

266
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,120
is over time so each green<font color="#E5E5E5"> line is the</font>

267
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,209
lifetime of a prefix and you can see

268
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know this operation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

269
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,890
quite a few of these they basically

270
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:15,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">announce new space or a few hours every</font>

271
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,649
day in batches of eight prefixes stop

272
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,100
announcing it and immediately start a

273
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:24,010
new batch of prefixes so very

274
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting so we start to reach out to</font>

275
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,279
the upstream providers of these guys and

276
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,339
say hey you know do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what's</font>

277
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,020
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and happened that we knew quite</font>

278
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,520
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these guys so we work with them</font>

279
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,610
some of some of you guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font>

280
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,220
here and first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said do you</font>

281
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,750
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on and and and and one</font>

282
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,310
of the interesting things that we heard

283
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,899
initially was you know what this

284
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,449
customer is listed as a DDoS mitigation

285
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,950
provider in our files and that's the

286
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're announcing new space</font>

287
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,550
all the time I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay that's</font>

288
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because this space is not</font>

289
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">used by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure who</font>

290
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,449
you're protecting so we went on from

291
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,490
there and and we're pretty quickly able

292
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,140
to determine that you know based on that

293
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,279
flow data and stuff like that the desi

294
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,020
is indeed all spam or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> all email</font>

295
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,209
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sooo pretty it's so much</font>

296
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically a hundred percent SME traffic</font>

297
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,989
so much that it was almost suspicious

298
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,660
like there's no control traffic there

299
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,670
was basically no DNS traffic no ssh

300
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,949
traffic or any of the other traffic we

301
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,479
would expect so I mean it's a different

302
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,610
discussion but we think that there might

303
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,980
be just another control channel into the

304
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,500
celebration but the second question

305
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,510
quickly became why are you not filtering

306
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,520
these guys it seems to me that you're

307
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just letting them announce new prefixes</font>

308
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,900
at will I know you I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

309
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,520
reputable what's going on here you just

310
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,370
we got to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the filters or something</font>

311
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,170
and he said no we're used we use strict

312
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,960
filtering and our filters are based on

313
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,959
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> biet and indeed it turns out that</font>

314
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,350
these guys had added route objects for

315
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,550
eats of the prefixes that they announced

316
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,680
its highlights an interesting pace

317
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,689
because the provider in question was

318
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,370
doing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess most of us would</font>

319
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,110
expect them to do there were rather be

320
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:06,160
acts they were generating filters every

321
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,260
day and still this got through so the

322
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,300
interesting thing is so with our DB and

323
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,970
some of the other databases you can just

324
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:16,420
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> any route of you want but any prefix</font>

325
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,910
you so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can add prefixes for or</font>

326
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,939
rather be<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for this but Google or</font>

327
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,860
DNS root nameservers for your prefixes

328
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,630
for my prefixes it's scary stuff right

329
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,040
once it's in there they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just you</font>

330
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,020
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most surprised or generates built</font>

331
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,750
or seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can announce it pretty scary</font>

332
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,810
um it's not not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

333
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,910
databases like ripe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> AP neg there is</font>

334
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,650
some form of check if you actually own

335
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,120
the block but something like re<font color="#CCCCCC"> DB which</font>

336
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,730
is you know definitely one of the more

337
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,870
popular providers allow you to register

338
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">in um it's not all bad though because</font>

339
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this data we are able to then look</font>

340
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,350
at you know what else is this is doing

341
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,700
so we started running report but what

342
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,530
other rather be extra in there and we

343
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,130
were in we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thousands of products</font>

344
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:02,319
for this origin asn which by the way is

345
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,240
registered to someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Argentina but</font>

346
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,130
that's also squatted that has hadn't

347
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">been used years the bully just register</font>

349
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,849
it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah indeed we were able to</font>

350
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,160
verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there were rather be acts</font>

351
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,950
for announcements that were seen in the

352
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">past and we're used to spam many of</font>

353
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,760
those prefixes were now I'm spam list

354
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,530
but it also gave us a looking glass into

355
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future if some of these things</font>

356
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,449
weren't announced yet and we're indeed

357
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:30,430
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced over the next few days</font>

358
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,770
and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing was we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can take a</font>

359
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the maintainer of yet and we</font>

360
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,630
find all kinds of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but</font>

361
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,660
one of the things was what we previous

362
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:43,470
leave to be separate operations as in

363
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,180
like different<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns and upstream asns</font>

364
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,830
we're actually one in the same operation

365
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,109
we believe because they all share the

366
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,580
same main inner so that maintainer had

367
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,860
raided rather be actual other

368
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,720
a SNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and prefixes as well basically</font>

369
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,310
done the exact same thing but just share

370
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk a little bit like this upstream</font>

371
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,420
provider is going to shut me down and at

372
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,339
least have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other one still so we</font>

373
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the providers many of them did</font>

374
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:10,030
what they had to do reach out to our DB

375
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,560
who apparently removed the accounts a

376
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,110
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days later the oldest brother the</font>

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,890

378
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">case where we're spammers use this a lot</font>

379
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:23,290
because there are literally thousands

380
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,300
and thousands of things going on and

381
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,300
still are going on this is another

Year's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where apparently spamming doesn't</font>

vacation<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about spamming this isn't</font>

389
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,350
2013's a little bit longer ago but I

390
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">think most of you remember the D dose</font>

391
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:56,620
that almost broke the internet or not

392
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,500
but either way Spamhaus one of the fires

393
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,820
of spam<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was being attacked they moved</font>

394
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,520
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pout flare and I got 300 gigs data</font>

395
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,780
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of stuff broke but at</font>

396
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,530
the same time there was another attack

397
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:14,560
back there someone the same person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

398
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,690
supposedly initiated adidas also started

399
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,770
to announce a slush 32 but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

400
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Spamhaus rbl servers so an rbl server is</font>

401
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,690
basically a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server and say is this</font>

402
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,720
IP address reputable or not and it will

403
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,430
return a positive or negative turn um so

404
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,590
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy done is inserted route</font>

405
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,170
actually set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a server and was</font>

406
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,300
replying to DNS queries and was actually

407
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying for every questions like is this</font>

408
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,230
IP address spam or spammer or a bad

409
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:46,149
reputation say yes yes yes yes so

410
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:49,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically everything was marked as spam</font>

411
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,680
now so the amount of spam that or the

412
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of email that was marked as spam</font>

413
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,600
during this period went up significantly

414
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,180
basically rendering the spam house

415
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,520
search on unusable for people and they

416
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,170
had to shut this down so this was

417
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,519
primarily seen this particular

418
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,529
announcement was seen all over the

419
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,809
Saddam internet exchange at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at that</font>

420
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:10,759
time which brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> up another interesting</font>

point you remember the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin thing I</font>

00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:16,190
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also seen just on an I acts on the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Toronto internet exchange um so it's</font>

424
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,080
almost like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a provider's tend</font>

425
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:22,339
to do a fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job of filtering</font>

426
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,889
obviously not perfect but there are

427
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:26,509
methods in place and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that for</font>

428
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:28,519
a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet</font>

429
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:31,669
exchanges most of us don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use</font>

430
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:35,029
max prefix filters and if you announce

431
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,889
25 prefixes today I<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably allow you</font>

00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:41,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you sneak in one or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two more that</font>

434
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,919
nobody will really notice which is why

435
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,869
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things are more effective</font>

436
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:52,519
over internet exchanges um so another

437
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:54,889
example here so this internet in Syria

438
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,409
has been talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot we've</font>

439
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:59,238
written about it tweeted about it so

440
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:02,059
primarily around outages right so

441
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:05,209
there's one major telecom provider in

442
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:09,109
Syria ste they've been offline every now

443
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:12,169
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> December and again</font>

444
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:15,408
in January we saw two unique events

445
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:18,649
where they miss originated hijacked

446
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:21,739
whatever term you prefer most to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1500</font>

447
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:24,789
prefixes affecting about 300 autonomous

448
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:26,779
systems typically for a few minutes

449
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,879
obviously I have no idea of this was

450
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:32,089
intentional or not I can just look at

451
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:34,668
the data but either way I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

452
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:36,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't really matter because traffic</font>

453
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:38,149
was the fact that traffic was being

454
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,509
redirected and this is a visualization

455
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:44,418
for one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube prefixes the big</font>

456
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:45,679

457
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:47,570

458
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,539
propagated through in this case Telecom

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,579
Italia ste has multiple of trim /<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus</font>

460
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,349
but this was only seen through Telecom

461
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:57,499
Italia and then propagated to the guys

462
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:59,359
like entity hurricane electric you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

463
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:02,690
these guys together have a fairly large

464
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,699
customer owned so it's it's likely that

465
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">any of these guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube in this case so that would have</font>

469
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:20,419
been a quite a volume of traffic

471
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:25,600
probably have been adjusted so if

472
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,940
whether this was intentional or not

473
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,699
would argue but definitely it would have

474
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:36,350
affected connectivity for these prefixes

475
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,480
or significant amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> users and this</font>

476
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,080
is another you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of similar case</font>

477
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,460
we're proud leaks so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess rod leaks</font>

the terms been used for different things

479
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,380
but what I mean in this case is if two

480
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,059
providers like level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and ET and a</font>

481
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,799
smaller guy in the middle and a small

00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:55,700
guy basically relays the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes that it</font>

485
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,150
stuff filtering through and typically

486
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:04,520
this has to do with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that outdated</font>

487
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:06,500
prefix filters where maybe cloud layer

488
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,330
or AWS in this case used to be a

489
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer and and and they would just</font>

490
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,530
match them the prefix and it gets

491
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:15,470
through so this goes to significant

492
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,690
outlets for<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> October AWS</font>

lots of people changing paths do that

<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of traffic that dies like AWS and</font>

it's easily a few dozen X maybe a

506
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,000
exactly what happened October traffic

<font color="#CCCCCC">gets rerouted to this case Colombia or</font>

Argentina and that's where you know it

509

is a bottleneck and<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter that these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are not intentional or malicious but</font>

again with packs are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple so look</font>

at a few examples some of them

then out to BG again traffic optimizers

then to be strangely enough a lot of

530
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:54,020
times involved somehow so traffic

531
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:56,420
optimizer devices like ngoc thien and

532
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,070
internet they figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what are your</font>

533
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,480
popular destinations and then they do

measurements and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they go oh if you</font>

provider here is better than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

537
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,550
sometimes they create new<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount and</font>

538
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,110
announcements so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that I know</font>

539
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,970
this is / 16 and they're going to

540
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,879
optimize that but they do is they make

541
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:16,370
up a new / 2 News laughs / Seventeen's

542
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,350
insert that and that's all fine as long

543
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,330
as it stays within your own network but

544
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:23,449
then it leaks out and will basically

545
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,070
leak out it's bad announcement similars

546
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,660
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened with Pakistan and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

547
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,110
where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically exported their</font>

548
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:33,140
censorship another interesting one is if

549
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:36,080
you look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn that are involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

550
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,300
what appears to be hijacking you see a

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,679
suspiciously high number in the lower a

552

553
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,270
of I jacking which you know seems odd

554
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,670
but in fact it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a hijack</font>

555
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,040
whether people really trying to do is a

560
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,130
is the next hope is the actual ASM so

561
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,439
it's not a hijack but it's definitely an

562
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,410
interesting observation in terms of you

563
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,510
know who's in both<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of things</font>

564
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,300
anyways that was a quick summary of what

565
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,040
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on lots of non suspicious</font>

566
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,220
events but definitely some interesting

567
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,780
ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are worth looking at</font>

568
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have five minutes</font>

which is you can put anything in the

filter out some of the select ones what

so that helps us sort of filter out the

that they're beginning to be clever and

devious about where they inject these

both buying out of LA but then in there
