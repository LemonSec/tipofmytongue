program so goal of that program real

30
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,299
quick for those who weren't is to bring

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,970
what we consider to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the most</font>

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:27,020
important things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do to nanog</font>

of network operations as a hiring

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,609
manager it's a big challenge for me is

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,160
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire in the audience of sure</font>

37
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,780
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pipeline seems to be</font>

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,180
getting more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more constricted not</font>

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,810
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more open and so anything we</font>

can do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help that</font>

41
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,630
as an organization is certainly within

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,180
experiencing this great event like I we

55
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,209
have attended this event via webcast

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,760
earlier with Karen's help but this was a

57
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,220
unique experience we made a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you</font>

and we made a new network connections

59
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,760
and we get to know that how industry

60
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,790
works and what are the issues currently

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,858
using the internet and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

discussion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the solution provided</font>

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,380
here it was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> informative and good</font>

session for us three days<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

69
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,829

thank you very much Jake so that's

71
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,048
fantastic the goal is we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 students</font>

72
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,149
here this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a professor</font>

73
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,399
kevin efforts<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kevin a person as Jay</font>

74
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,859
mentioned the goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> expand this</font>

75
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,030
program in San Francisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be</font>

76
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,160
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the San Francisco</font>

77
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is June first through</font>

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,470
third is school is out of session

79
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,150
although there are certainly summer

80
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,410
programs so it'll be interesting to see

81
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,989
the mix of students<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we get from</font>

82
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,330
those summer programs but our goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

83
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,880
expand this beyond just UC Boulder UC

84
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,240
Boulder was convenient based on Kevin

85
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,469
being part of the nanog community but

86
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,389
we've had interest from across the

87
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,680
country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and even internationally at this</font>

88
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,860
point that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

89
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,280
challenge is figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out who to who to</font>

90
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,630
bring at each meeting so we will get

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,770
survey results back from the individual

92
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,570
students that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be aggregated through</font>

93
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,760
their professor to let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how we</font>

94
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,760
can help make this program even more

95
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,349
useful but certainly if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see them</font>

96
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">around in the hallway for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the remainder</font>

97
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,130
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day although I think most of them</font>

98
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,430
are headed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out shortly do say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi you</font>

99
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">know certainly get to know them and make</font>

100
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:28,630
them feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome in this community so</font>

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:32,530
with that thank you I hope you all

102
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:36,539

103
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,830
haven't seen outside this hotel much I

104
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:42,250
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do with it</font>

105
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">being a bit colder but is a great venue</font>

106
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:52,210
here in the hotel in the great city I

107
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:53,860
hope you agree yes good good<font color="#CCCCCC"> um here's</font>

108
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,419
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the statistics that I always</font>

109
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to try to share at the end of the</font>

110
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:01,419
meeting it's just kind of reflection<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

111
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,370
good information in terms of what makes

112
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:08,320
up a nanog meeting the numbers 622

113
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,110
officially on site that number of

114
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,110
registered was a little bit higher so I

115
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,060
suspect the weather had an impact on

116
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,000
some folks not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get here</font>

117
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:23,230
but still a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strong number for</font>

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,790
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site attendance we had 409</font>

119
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,760
of those 60 well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to read</font>

120
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:33,070
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you can see it the interesting</font>

121
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:35,170
thing that continues to I think ring

122
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,380
loud and clear is the investment that

123
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:42,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the education element or a student</font>

124
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">population have at nanog the numbers are</font>

125
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,289
always right around the five or ten of

126
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,080
those students<font color="#E5E5E5"> who pay their own way to</font>

127
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,790
get here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the college</font>

128
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,280
immersion program and the scholars are

129
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:58,980
really starting to enter into the mix

130
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:03,570
which you know is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

131
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:07,420
continuing the future of what we all do

132
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,310
19 countries 19 countries represented

133
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:14,380
which is again very consistent we have

134
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:17,920
generally 25 to 19 countries represented

135
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:23,290
at any one meeting so just a sampling

136
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're the types of organizations that</font>

137
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:29,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent the most individuals to an an</font>

138
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:34,350
augmenting I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's still very</font>

139
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:39,070
telling that it is a operator hardware

140
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:42,640
content hardware network content I think

141
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:45,580
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are statistics in terms</font>

142
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:50,050
of the demographics it's kind of hard to

143
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:52,990

fill out your registration you give us a

146
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,930
true sense of your background but that's

147
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,880
the spread of the type of folks are here

148
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:07,510

149
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,760
the meeting room space I think another

150
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,610
important element is that nonprofit

151
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:17,289
number I think it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

152
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,550
also serve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-profit sector of our</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">alone we don't have a wealth of staff</font>

158
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,439
