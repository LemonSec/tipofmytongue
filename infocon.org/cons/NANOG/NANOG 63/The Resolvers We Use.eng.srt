<font color="#E5E5E5">to be quick</font>

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,430
um how many folks think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,900
running a really really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you</font>

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,610
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> just works it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just brilliant I</font>

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,520
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking as part of trying to measure</font>

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,180
DNS SEC and I was looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,900
percentage of folk who can't resolve a

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,790
dns name with one query because

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,440
typically the way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS works is you</font>

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,150
get a name you send out your query to

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,129
your resolve you get an answer news move

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:50,820
on one packet one<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">percent of the world can't where we</font>

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">found this out was we're using an online</font>

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,059
advertising network and we sample around

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,760
half a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million folk every day from all</font>

21
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,709
over the planet and what we found is the

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term average about one quarter of</font>

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:10,590
folk have really really crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS totally</font>

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:13,500
 and what's worse is it around

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,510
six percent of them make more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than two</font>

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,330
seconds to resolve a name they've never

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,210
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about one in</font>

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,850
twelve folk which the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS is a complete</font>

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,789
citing nightmare<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sort of sit there</font>

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,658
and go why if we all think we're doing

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:34,290
such a fantastic job<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the DNS so crap</font>

32
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,409
for so many folk obviously something is

33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:42,119
really weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the DNS so what's</font>

34
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:45,689
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here um there are lots of</font>

35
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,790
reasonable reasons you can't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

36
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to do a decent resolver you get it</font>

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,369
wrong no one's paying you to do it to a

38
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:57,538
job or maybe the user themselves has

39
00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:01,399
picked the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong resolver so what's the</font>

40
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:04,399
relationship between<font color="#E5E5E5"> users and resolvers</font>

41
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,140
now that's a really good question

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,320
because when you look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,800
perspective of all someone like the NSA

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">for example why bother trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to spy on</font>

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,880
what users do in web<font color="#CCCCCC"> logs and so on when</font>

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,480
you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out everything you need to</font>

47
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,129
know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS lo the DNS resolver query</font>

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,018
logs are about the richest vein of

49
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:26,549
information on the net that we have it's

50
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,819
actually real time information about

51
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,280
what you and I and every

52
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:33,548
one else does you can get astonishingly

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,920
good demographic so<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you resolve</font>

54
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,989
and who<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets that information is</font>

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,530
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really interesting kind of</font>

56
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:43,540
question so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to try and get</font>

57
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,359
interested now in to what extent this is

58
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,849
information leakage and what I'm really

59
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:50,709
interested in is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> folk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leak</font>

60
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:53,290
their dns queries across network

61
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:55,859
boundaries and how many folks actually

62
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,298
leaked it across national boundaries

63
00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:00,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">because once you start leaking it across</font>

64
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:01,989
national boundaries all those

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,349
traditional protections that we thought

66
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:07,139
we had as citizens don't apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in</font>

67
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country where your data is residing</font>

68
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,819
you're an alien and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

69
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,858
protection under their law so part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

70
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:17,708
this issue is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet starts to</font>

00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:20,889
create all these challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> about bear</font>

72
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:22,750
is our information heading to and part

73
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's actually all</font>

74
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the DNS so as I said we use an</font>

75
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,129
online advertising campaign to measure a

76
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:32,079
whole bunch of thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

77
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:34,409
typically it's all about measuring how

78
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:37,329
much v6 is out there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's using it</font>

79
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:39,459
you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know it's also about</font>

80
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,549
measuring the use of DNS SEC and how

81
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,449
many folk actually do validation

82
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,329
slightly better but you don't want to

83
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:49,509
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're also able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

84
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,150
to match a DNS query to an authoritative

85
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,339
name server against the resultant

86
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address that does the</font>

87
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,989
subsequent URL fetch and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them</font>

88
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,298
together so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can match the IP address</font>

89
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:06,489
of the resolver you use against your

90
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:08,739
address so across 2014 google ads are

91
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,829
really good really really really good

92
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,959
104 million sample points and we picked

93
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,000
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> under half a million unique</font>

94
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,099
resolvers that actually send their

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
queries to authoritative name servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> ie</font>

96
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:24,639
us this is skewed data because we're

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,800
cheap bastards Google present our ads in

98
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,020
cheap countries so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do a bit</font>

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,030
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> catch-up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards to normalize this</font>

100
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,770
to actually compensate where there are

101
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,630
richer countries that bid higher for ads

102
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">than we're prepared to bid but with a</font>

103
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,130
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normalization you get to</font>

104
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,380
this thing these are the resolvers that

105
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,980
asked us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most questions</font>

106
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:48,850
that looks bloody weird doesn't it 74

107
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,530
doll 125<font color="#E5E5E5"> God who owns that address well</font>

108
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,220
you know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the origin is it's</font>

109
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:57,609
all google this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google's 888 resolver</font>

110
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,830
farm so counting individual IP addresses

111
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,620
doesn't work what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about if we group them</font>

112
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,359
by a s number that gets a little bit

113
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,620
more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google have thirty four</font>

114
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,540
percent of the market share<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

115
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,580
global dns holy crap that's weird I'm

116
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,260
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's true China</font>

117
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,700
comes in second with three percent that

118
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,250
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> more like it there an awful lot of</font>

119
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,710
Chinese but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even so this is still a</font>

120
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,410
little bit weird and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect that's</font>

121
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,840
because when Google has its resolve a

122
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,480
farm I actually get multiplied<font color="#CCCCCC"> theories</font>

123
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,369
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to time so the one query comes</font>

124
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,050
in and the number of slaves say I can do

125
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,470
this I can do this all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over themselves</font>

126
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,720
with enthusiasm and over ask I can

127
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,280
compensate for that by making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

128
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,860
I only count one resolver for each

129
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,299
unique question and this then leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

130
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,710
the following list which seems more

131
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,030
credible this is across<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of 2014</font>

132
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google had for that entire year an</font>

133
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,739
average of<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little bit under ten</font>

134
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,570
percent of market share so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

135
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,710
you people<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear back group over there</font>

136
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,210
use google huge the next one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,950
course the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chinese there are a lot of</font>

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">chinese and they do centralized their</font>

139
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,200
dns oddly<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough so the chinanet</font>

140

backbone has about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9.5 percent with</font>

141
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,300
exactly that reason the only other open

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,070
list is actually open dns which

144
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,380
currently claims around 1.3 percent of

145
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,900
the world's users and the rest seem to

146
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,270
be based around ISPs larger ISPs are

147
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-represented smaller ones less so</font>

148
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,580
so let's try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the aliens among</font>

149

this let's see if the user and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

resolver is in the same network and get

151
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:39,830
rid of those let's look at Polk who do

152
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,210
their resolution in another network and

153
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,010
that gets rid of a lot of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

154

larger of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folk who if you will</font>

156
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,990

159
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,000
seem to use it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then oddly enough</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">china telecom again so twenty-seven</font>

163
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,930

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,700
under one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> three which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot so</font>

165
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,890
let's do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more filtering and</font>

166
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,710
look for when you're resolver is in

now the list of folk whose resolution is

199
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:49,930
others don't can we map it hell why not

200
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:52,180
this is the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> States and these are</font>

201
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,089
the countries where folk who if you will

202
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,819
map to the United States use resolvers

203

that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> located in other countries now</font>

204
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,270
mentally the raw numbers are very very

205
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:03,700
scarce so I did scale it up to make the

206
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">colors all work but as you see there's a</font>

207
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,220
healthy distribution of the queries

208

Canada is we seem to be in North America

213
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,160
after all same thing an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

214
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,520
Canadians who do send their queries

215
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,920
elsewhere and I can read it right about

216
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,939
four or five percent of Canadians huge

217
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,250
amount sendak berries into China why you

218
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,959
would do that beat me with a stick but

219
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,580
those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> raw numbers you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it</font>

220
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,739
online to actually find out the ranking

221
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:49,000
there but as you see an awful lot in the

forth what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Chinese well the</font>

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">China</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you said a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of their queries</font>

into the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Australia God</font>

226
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:01,569
knows why I'm sure we'd never give them

227
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,369
the right answer anyway but they send to

228
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">send their queries there no matter what</font>

229
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,320
and so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> having fun here I'm mapping</font>

230
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,440
India again the Indian send their stuff

231
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:16,089
to Russia as much as to the US God knows

232
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,970
why I certainly don't um and then I'm

233
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:22,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking you know a lot of this really</font>

234
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just google so how much market share</font>

235
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,980
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google have and I was busy plotting</font>

236
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google through the year and you sit</font>

237
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,920
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go well ten eleven twelve</font>

238
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:36,430
percent then in mid-november<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

239
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,160
jumped and these days around<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-fifth</font>

240
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,290
of all dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries come from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google's</font>

public dns servers

242
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:49,860
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened in November I have no</font>

243
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,149
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my suspicions and I suspect</font>

244
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,570
although without having a clue that

245
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:58,389
maybe google chromecast or one of those

246
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:01,110
other forms of inbuilt apps decided not

247
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:04,589
to trust the local infrastructure and

248
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:07,480
instead on some kind of firmware upgrade

249
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:11,380
decided to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of their queries</font>

250
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,569
from the app directly into all AIDS but

251
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,790
the DNS SEC validation rates didn't

252
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:18,099
change so my suspicion is not any of

253
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">their using or lates but they've got DNS</font>

254
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,480
SEC checking disabled there's an awful

255
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,579
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folk with these kinds of apps</font>

256
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,500
because as we all know the Internet is

257
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:29,739
built the video streaming everything

258
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,420
else is incidental um so who

259
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:37,990
uses Google's public dns well that's the

260
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,910
map of where<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google is used an awful lot</font>

normalize this out to country

their queries off to Google and that's

285
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:41,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table we see of it</font>

286
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:46,209
so what does this say about the DNS

287
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:48,040
Google's one huge amount of the DNS is

288
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:51,399
now sitting inside google's Public DNS

289
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,610
system right now one in five berries

290
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,709
come from Google's public dns to me in

291
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,200
other words an awful<font color="#CCCCCC"> awful lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

292
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:03,550
are making a move through google for

293
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,839
their dns why well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the second</font>

294
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">bullet is actually really important</font>

295
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,490
because these<font color="#CCCCCC"> days a huge amount of</font>

296
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,310
regulatory action involves doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

297
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,560
blocking the Pirate Bay died SC is evil

298
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:18,130
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> our resolvers will not resolve</font>

299
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,839
it well<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose resolvers will google so</font>

300
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,910
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that national content</font>

301
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,410
blocking is<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS then all of a sudden</font>

302
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,120
google says well actually that's

303
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,910
 is use us and that's what

304
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,959
happened there's also this entire thing

305
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,069
about using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns to do geolocation</font>

306
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Netflix thinks I'm in the u.s. because</font>

307
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">my dns resolvers happened to be this</font>

308
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,310
this and that how do i make<font color="#E5E5E5"> netflix</font>

309
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,110
thinks that I'm a US citizen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

310
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,599
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> their awesome video library of</font>

311
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,279
 well I change my dns resolvers to

312
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,170
something in the US and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become a u.s.</font>

313
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,089
person for netflix paying their six

314
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,829
bucks a month and everyone's happy my

315
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,930
dns looks like because all my

316
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">resolution is having to the US but i can</font>

317
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:59,649
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> a netflix so i'm happy so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

318
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:02,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yeah right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um also I suspect</font>

319
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,839
there's an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS monitoring</font>

320
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:07,239
and stalking and it's much much harder

321
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,760
to find it I talked I think an hour or

322
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">two before about URL stalking and how i</font>

323
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,380
found a browser in China that just

324
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:16,750
leaked like a sieve I suspect there are

325
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,390
DNS queries and DNS stalking is

326
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,579
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time finding it out is</font>

327
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually much much harder because unlike</font>

328
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">URLs the DNS doesn't give you clear</font>

329
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,480
signatures of who's doing it so it's a

330
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit tougher but I suspect there's</font>

331
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,459
an awful lot of DNS stalking going on

332
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,500
last but not least if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

333
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:37,959
I put a virus on you what do i do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

334
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,149
change your dns resolvers because then

335
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,920
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you and I suspect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

336
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:43,810
little bit of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on the boo that</font>

337
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,839
owned systems tend to have their

338
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,670
resolution happening somewhere else of

339
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,589
course I'm not authoritative on this I

340
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't do malware for a living you might</font>

341
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,019
if

342
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,480
you have a favorite theory inserted at

343
00:14:53,019 --> 00:15:01,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bottom um where's this heading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

344
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,040
suspect that the DNS is aggregating like

345
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:06,459
crazy and it's not a competitive market

346
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,139
anymore ISPs don't get paid for dns

347
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:12,250
resolution it's a loss not a revenue and

348
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,870
outsourcing it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> google and simply</font>

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care to send it off to</font>

350

someone else is easy it's simple it gets

351
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:23,139
rid of a problem but it a grenade<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam</font>

that's fine but you've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> admit no</font>

matter how good your intention that's

we've turned off everything google

363
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:52,120
public dns is enough they're right it is

364
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,639
enough so is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to reduce that</font>

365
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,860
information exposure what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

366
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,709
about making the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS better about being</font>

367
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,240
a massive leak of information and what's

368
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,029
the nature of that trade-off between

369
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,790
resolution performance and information

370
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:09,009
leakage because where we are now is in a

371
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,589
savagely unequal battle between you and

372
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:14,160
I as users and information aggregators

373
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,660
and data miner it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working I</font>

374
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,250
put the data online but I put it behind

375
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,569
a bunch of maps if you want to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

376
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the maps anywhere just click on a</font>

377
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:26,079
country that URL will take you<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I</font>

378
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:35,410
had 15 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got one minute to go</font>

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:37,239
for questions thank you hi hi my name is

380
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,250
Zhang shun from tripadvisor i'm

381
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,050
wondering if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also happen to look at</font>

382
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,380
the front end and back end IP of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

383
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:46,209
resolver so one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've noticed</font>

384
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,129
that's interesting is a lot of the open

385
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,959
resolver i actually just forwarders only

386
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:52,439
and like eighty percent of the moisture

387
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,300
using google public dns that's their

388
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:57,189
recursive resolver so some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

389
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,620
along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the data that you are</font>

390
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:01,149
presenting here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the</font>

391
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,939
interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what are the front</font>

392
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">end IP those user ID using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus the</font>

393
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:08,688
<font color="#E5E5E5">pagan IP com</font>

394
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,380
out of the authoritative services I said

395
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:14,420
before the DNS is an information leak it

396
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,370
just leaked so much information it's not

397
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,040
funny oddly enough one of the things it

398
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,560
doesn't tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about itself when</font>

399
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,270
you get a query from a recursive

400
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,399
resolver to the authoritative resolver

401
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,610
it tells you nothing about why that

402
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:33,380
query has happened there is no history

403
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:36,199
so I cannot tell how that resolver or

404
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">why is asking me that question what I do</font>

405
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,760
know is some time before that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sent a</font>

406
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:46,130
URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a particular user so i understand</font>

407
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,770
the original IP address of the customer

408
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,010
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a DNS query I know</font>

409
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:54,860
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the chain of DNS query</font>

410
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,950
events so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately that information</font>

411
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:02,360
isn't in the DNS sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

412
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:06,350
thank you I Randy Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot Randy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bush</font>

413
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:10,040
i J Jeff I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think just um quibble you're</font>

414
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:13,060
confusing market the market in DNS is

415
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,470
selling authoritative service and

416
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,510
registration that's why people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

417
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,540
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk us out the resolution</font>

418
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:23,330
because there's no market so saying that

419
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:26,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google has ten or twelve percent of that</font>

420
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,550
market is a little confusing I

421
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,890
understand and I'm actually pointing out

422
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,899
there is a new market in data mining the

423
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,090
dns and that is the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm talking</font>

424
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:39,620
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a scary market i</font>

425
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:41,899
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's scary let's not go down</font>

439
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,770
you're in that data is terrible

440
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,199
we use a third-party geo location

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,850
provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's slightly better which</font>

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:28,520
DNS when you come to our site we look at

444
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">your IP if and we do a look up on that</font>

IP against the geolocation table we

446
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,059
either redirect you to the correct

447
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,429
country site or tell you service is not

448
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:39,230
available we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the data in DNS</font>

449
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,780
is terrible and when we set out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build</font>

450
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,430
our own CDM the very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

451
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,460
was go we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how not</font>

452
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:49,820
to do this with DNS and I had very very

453
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,280
heated arguments with with my peers

454
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,790
about even putting the names of our CDN

455
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,020
servers into DNS because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh</font>

456
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,170
what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people start using that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

457
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,480
localization so no dns here yeah right

458
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:05,240
my problem though Dave is I've seen the

459
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,050
amount of Google use jump by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5%</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> globally</font>

460
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,570
overnight yeah so somebody somewhere in

461
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:14,330
a violently popular application or

462
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:16,159
service that application or service had

463
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,460
flicked over to using Google's public

464
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,800
dns with checking disabled and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

465
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,110
searching for incredibly popular apps

466
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,240
right and when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> searched for incredibly</font>

467
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,520
popular apps I think you'd agree Netflix

468
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,870
is part of that search space you're

469
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,990
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me you're not the target this</font>

470
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:35,090
time that's why start up no so we've

471
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,320
absolutely seen devices routers things

472
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,520
like that I'm stealing his thunder a

473
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,520
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna say some of</font>

474
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,530
this we've seen devices that have

475
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,240
Google's DNS hard-coded in them either

476
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,309
by default you mentioned the opendns

477
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,370
thing and like neck years yeah like that

478
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:51,770
but we've absolutely seen that both in

479
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:55,879
consumer devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even the routers</font>

480
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:56,840
but like a streaming stick or a TV where

481
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,030
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go oh well this is</font>

482
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:03,590
ubiquitously available now a sudden

483
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:05,360
everything should be Google yep hi this

484
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">is Dan Ellis from cloud helix and I'll</font>

485
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:12,080
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave said we are seeing</font>

486
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,000
or previously I saw quite a few routers

487
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,909
that have proxies in them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns and</font>

488
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,650
those proxies are horrible so an

489
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,270
increasingly number large number of

490
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,640
applications started by saying if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

491
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,170
can't get an answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my local DNS</font>

492
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,610
provider which is a router then I'm

493
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to google and now some</font>

494
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,899
applications or even on first attempt

495
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,250
just going straight to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

496
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:34,500
right it's real<font color="#CCCCCC"> that explains some of it</font>

497
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,899
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tenth of</font>

498
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,029
November somebody turned something on

499
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:41,908
globally and that's the one I'm hunting

500
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:43,799
for my current my current best candidate

501
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:55,049
if it's not Netflix is Google's

502
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:58,620
chromecast but we'll see hello Alex

503
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:02,210
Oriakhi curator<font color="#CCCCCC"> labs just more edition I</font>

504
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:06,178
told to a lot of pages in my countries

505
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:11,130
and in Europe and some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> predators</font>

506
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:15,059
and probably I just too i can add

507
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,340
something the problem is that DNA is for

508
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:20,789
operators is something like IT services

509
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,059
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're our operators we are not about</font>

510
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:26,970
80 services we are about routers

511
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:30,090
switches and so on and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of writers</font>

512
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:33,139
are trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of those services</font>

513
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:36,240
and that's why Google is popular because

514
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:38,850
operator a lot of pressure who doesn't

515
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,210
care about this part just doesn't care

516
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,158
so you care about delivery a bit you

517
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,289
care about the service you deliver your

518
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,230
customers and you go and you think are

519
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:52,549
the DNS is irrelevant stuff good

520
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,710
thinking it's not my thing I'm just

521
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:58,620
describing the situation it's bad that's

522
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,649
bad definitely that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a evil but that's</font>

523
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,939
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need to do</font>

524
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:05,939
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this state of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

525
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually couldn't agree more thank you</font>

526
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,210
