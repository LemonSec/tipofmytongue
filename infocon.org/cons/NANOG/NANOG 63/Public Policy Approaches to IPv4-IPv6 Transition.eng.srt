00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:13,549
alright so next up was Lee Howard from

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,330
time warner cable he's done analysis of

3
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:20,189
both policies and adoption of ipv6 and

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:24,060
web when access networks and has some

5
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:32,969
suggestions about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact for Public</font>

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,230
maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to your you Ministry of</font>

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,610
to present some<font color="#E5E5E5"> counsel to you on some</font>

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might do based on what</font>

other<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries have done your first</font>

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,408
question Your Majesty might be is this

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,299
actually a public policy issue this is

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to worry about we</font>

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> royal we sense my answer would be</font>

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,950
maybe this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is up to you ipv4 is the</font>

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,479
status quo with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> status</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quo is</font>

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,270
changing and I've demonstrated in

28
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,150
previous talks about how costs will rise

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know TCO of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cg end costs money</font>

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,409
there's a there's an address market and

31
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,700
what you might mostly be worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

32
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,670
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what some other countries</font>

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,400
have demonstrated concern about is that

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,799
the deployment of ipv6 might be costly

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,570
or hurried or<font color="#E5E5E5"> island e to make up a word</font>

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
those costs are obviously you know how

37
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,100
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> it costs in hardware but also</font>

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,170
mostly in knowledge and the opportunity

do that hurried pneus may tends to make

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,929
things error-prone if people start<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

43
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,939
late and realize they need to rush that

44
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">island eater my get from actually the</font>

45
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,930
case of Singapore where they have a no

00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:16,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">island in policy where they want to make</font>

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,790

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,138
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies inside their country can</font>

49
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,540
reach any part of the internet whether

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,400
it's v4 or v6 and not have

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,069
islands of dis connectivity so it's

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty important um and what one of</font>

53
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,679
things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to pay</font>

54
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:33,930
attention to is coordinating the the

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,120
deployment of ipv6 to some extent in

56
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,069
order to maximize the network effect

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,230
that is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that if somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

58
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,480
deployed v6 they want to maximize the

59
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,369
benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get from ipv6 which is</font>

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,290
that network effect and so some

61
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,920
coordination might help there maybe

62
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,290
there's some things you can do so what

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,510
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened how has deployment happened</font>

64
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,409
over the course of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet well</font>

65
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,700
there's this really interesting

66
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:02,700
visualization we took ilovecharts that

67
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:07,108
turn out pretty so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

68
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">jesse took some data over time of web</font>

69
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:12,739
deployment among various countries now

70
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,540
the x-axis is the proportion of

71
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,549
countries sorry the x-axis is the

72
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,429
percent of websites supporting epi v6

73
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:23,459
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> y-axis is the density the number</font>

74
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,949
of countries for that percentage that

75
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,870
supports v6 so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance at five</font>

76
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:29,250
percent a very high number of countries

77
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,440
have five percent of their top 50

78
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,139
websites<font color="#E5E5E5"> for TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six and as you go out</font>

79
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,780
along the x-axis a very small number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

80
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,090
countries has forty percent but you can

81
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,379
see especially the top countries you

82
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,000
well you can't see because it's too

83
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,179
small but you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font>

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,859
countries have moved from over there at

<font color="#CCCCCC">the five percent I've moved across the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">higher percent of their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

88
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,889
supporting v6 what we wanted to do each

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,409
line here represents one day and how

90
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,720
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries that day at top websites</font>

91
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,750
sporting v6 and what we're looking for

92
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,569
is where there are sudden jumps where

93
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is white space so anytime that you</font>

94
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,349
see a wide volume under the curve that

95
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,078
means more countries have more support

96
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,358
that's good that bright red line is

97
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,519
world ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch that's when a whole</font>

98
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,250
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of sites suddenly supported</font>

99
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,800
v6 that's great and then we noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

100
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,440
couple of other sort of Buster's of days

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,090
where suddenly traffic moved and moved

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,919
out to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right meaning more countries</font>

103
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,020
at a higher percentage those turned out

104
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,479
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd flare turning on doing major</font>

105
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,248
activations of these six so you know

106
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,299
there's there's one company so may

107
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:38,849
be one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Your Majesty should</font>

108
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:41,369
consider is it is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to CloudFlare</font>

109
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,959
and seeing what they did there seems to

110
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:46,199
be some direct input just from that one

111
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:49,169
company now let me talk about what a

112
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,089
government might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so there</font>

113
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:53,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">are basically three as we observed</font>

114
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,319
various countries deployments we

115
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:57,569
observed three different kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sets</font>

116
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,999
of things that happen the first is

117
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,649
direct policy efforts things that

118
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,349
governments can do themselves just

119
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:06,539
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the government so</font>

120
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:08,938
that's the sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that a monarch</font>

121
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,709
decree is going to happen then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

122
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,139
partnerships with public and<font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

123
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">private partnerships hybrid policy areas</font>

124
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,759
and then in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> final case we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

125
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,899
about the charismatic policy

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,519
entrepreneur<font color="#E5E5E5"> within both individual</font>

127
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:25,229
companies and firms and within the

128
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,459
operational epistemic community there's

129
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,839
some jargon there that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

130
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,719
to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and explain what I mean</font>

131
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:34,229
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to talk about that so let</font>

132
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:35,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">me first say what can a country do to</font>

133
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,318
promote ipv6 well they're basically

134
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,869
three sets of things you can do one you

135
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,610
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the direct government's effort of</font>

136
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:44,399
requiring government<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites and</font>

137
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,769
services to run over v6 cosplayer you

138
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,599
can provide some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of incentives or</font>

139
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,969
requirements or private industry to

140
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:54,569
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> six or you can provide funding</font>

141
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:56,248
even maybe a company to deploy v6 we've

142
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:59,069
actually seen some cases with each of

143
00:05:56,249 --> 00:06:01,559
those so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what's actually</font>

144
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,629
worked so here here's a list of

145
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:05,549
countries with high adoption of ipv6

146
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,099
among their top 50 websites this is from

147
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:11,369
Eric Pincus site and I've specifically

148
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:14,039
listed on the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm well so there's</font>

149
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:15,419
there are several countries tied there

150
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,229
and I left out a couple of countries

151
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,378
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I'd especially</font>

152
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting case it so some of these</font>

153
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries have by so I let me go ahead</font>

154
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,789
and explain um there's a policy type

155
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,949
which coordinates York or relates to

156
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,329
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the right side in some of</font>

157
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,189
these countries there's a small group of

158
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:33,779
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is deployed v6 and that's</font>

159
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:35,279
what matters in others there's a single

160
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">company that's made a big difference and</font>

161
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,699
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the percentage of the top 50</font>

162
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,399
websites that's board v6 and then their

163
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,829
ranking overall so the Czech Republic is

164
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one country in the world or</font>

165
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:46,969
web deployment of ipv6 when you're

166
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,509
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top 50 websites</font>

167
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:49,230
thirty-four percent of their website

168
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">support Busey</font>

169
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,520
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty four percent that's that's</font>

170
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty good what kind of policy do they</font>

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,820
have well they specifically require

172
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,140
government services to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available over</font>

173
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,550
ipv6 and CZ nick has done a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great</font>

174
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,159
sorry Nick that's easy has done a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

175
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,530
job of providing reports on going about

176
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,020
which government sites support v6 pretty

177
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">impressive so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a specific case</font>

178
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is number three they also</font>

179
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,310
specifically require government services

180
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,840
to be available over ipv6 and then I

181
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,960
should go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and show you what I've</font>

182
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,119
circled<font color="#E5E5E5"> Singapore also requires these</font>

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,460
six to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available for all government</font>

184
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,980
services now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can argue that well but</font>

185
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,479
we haven't achieved a hundred percent

186
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,370
but there's been some success here and

187
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,460
what the correlation looks like it's

188
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,930
when a government requires there's serve

189
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,030
their web services their websites to be

190
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">available over v6 they go to their</font>

191
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,049
hosting provider who says well we've

192
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,790
never done v6 before we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

193
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,890
our transit providers and get b6 they

194
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,090
have to deploy v6 and there's an awful

195
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,159
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that somebody for the</font>

196
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,310
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> is getting paid to do to push</font>

197
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,960
this rock uphill when the next private

198
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,610
company comes in and says dual-stack our

199
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,130
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boris they go short we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

200
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that before no problem and so the it's</font>

201
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,120
the first site is really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after</font>

202
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that becomes much easier so there may be</font>

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,690
some correlation there some reason why

204
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,850
government services should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be available</font>

205
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,450
over ipv6 and there may be that and that

206
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,870
may make a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case of</font>

207
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,310
singapore's there are two other

208
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,270
incentives that I've listed here that

209
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,320
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that government</font>

210
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,419
specifically can do they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> require</font>

211
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,280
companies to provide ipv6 for the

212
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,110
websites and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can even provide money</font>

213
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,940
for them I only<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of two countries</font>

214
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,680
that have done either of these Singapore

215
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,590
which you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed here has both</font>

216
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,169
required v6 as part of its no I lending

217
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,970
principle and China which isn't even

218
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">listed here because very very few</font>

219
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:41,220
websites in China support ipv6 at least

220
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,840
that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see externally and that's</font>

221
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,140
partly because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't made a focus</font>

222
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,110
of webs of web content given credit

223
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,090
there now Singapore has also<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

224
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,440
paid some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition costs for</font>

225
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,840
certain countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge for certain</font>

226
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,670
companies so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance they said we</font>

227
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:03,120
they paid for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> their ID a paid for</font>

228
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:05,130
one bank to support ipv6 so

229
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,200
with that when ecommerce sites tried to

230
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,580
go support<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 there would already be a</font>

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,680
bank that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was available that could</font>

232
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,380
support that service so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

233
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">their strategic effort to make sure that</font>

234
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,689
they're removing obstacles for the next

235
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,920
company however there still tied at

236
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,440
number six<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of</font>

238
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,270
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the king or queen you can decide</font>

239
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,180
whether this is an important strategy

240
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,500
that you need to undertake and will note

241
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,959
that we do not that china isn't listed

242
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,990
here but what about ISPs is there a

243
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,420
correlation for isps well here's a list

244
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,430
of many of the top eyes countries in

245
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,430
terms of number of consumers that

246
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,779
support ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've included a couple that</font>

247
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,609
aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in the top because they're</font>

248
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:51,180
also I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use cases and</font>

249
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:54,270
I'll tell some stories as we go along so

250
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,300
Belgium is obviously far and away the

251
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,640
top country for ipv6 deployment among

252
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,069
consumers I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that again</font>

253
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,699
unless you are from Belgium your comp

254
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:09,180
your country is far behind belgium in

255
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,110
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 deployment so what have they</font>

256
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,290
done they had an incredible effort where

257
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:18,150
they they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> together the</font>

illegal under EU law that's a personal

267
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,760
an IP address is personally identifiable

268
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,200
therefore it must be personally

269
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,260
identifiable and if it's shared among

270
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,750
other users then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not personally</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">run out problem is a competitive problem</font>

277
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,290
so a new market entrant would not have

ipv4 addresses they would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to either</font>

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:06,240
go by addresses thus increasing the cost

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,650
of providing competition and providing

281
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,029
an economic advantage an anti

competitive advantage for the incumbents

283

or they'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide CGN which is</font>

291
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Belgium is unique in that regard and you</font>

292
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,820
can see it's been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very effective in</font>

293
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">terms of their deployment of ipv6 I note</font>

294
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,550
that the two incentives that I've talked

295
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:41,459
about there where the cyber security

296
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:44,550
concern about address sharing making law

297
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:48,540
enforcement more difficult and the net

298
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,949
neutrality competition effort making

299
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,630
sure that new entrants to the market

300
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,930
could compete with the already existing

301
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,779
providers pretty interesting so here

302
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,729
I've got circled again the rest of the

303
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:03,450
top part that the rest of the government

direct policies board top is BS we've

305
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,500
already talked about US government does

require v6 for web services not sure

307
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,959
that's had a direct impact on is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pete</font>

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,980
maybe there's some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

317
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,300
things are well there are these hybrid

318
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,610
public-private partnerships there are

319
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,109
two essential kinds there there's both

the CEOs for every company represented

and what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to their company so</font>

342
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,839
some of these things are how do we

343
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:40,258
bridge that gap in communication between

344
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,259
those two levels of the company so here

again list of ISPs and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

brought together the ISPs and and work

351
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,689
together Singapore I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked there they</font>

352
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,050
also brought in and they did a lot of

training<font color="#CCCCCC"> to among the private industry</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Slovenia Slovenia is we can</font>

355
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:11,099
specifically look to that example as a

356
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,170
country where one particular person

357
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,730
young George went to the government and

358
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,949
said this is important to us as a

359
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,449
country and they said wow it sure is how

360
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:20,490
much money<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you need and he said I</font>

361
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:22,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money I need you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send some</font>

362
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,019
invitations on letterhead CEOs of all

363
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet companies and bring them</font>

364
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,129
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a meeting and ask them what their</font>

365
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:32,009
plan is for ipv6 and therefore the CEOs

366
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:34,529
said what's ipv6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to go talk to</font>

367
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,180
their engineers and say what's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font>

368
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,430
to have something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what do I say</font>

369
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,719
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> get there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that helped them</font>

370
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,239
bring have something to say and then

371
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,769
they all SAT together in a room and SAT

372
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,329
and looked at each other and those who

373
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:47,100
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything constructive to say</font>

374
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:49,199
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 were a little bit embarrassed</font>

375
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,089
and so then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they kept having meetings</font>

376
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,410
every six months where these companies

377
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,329
would get together and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

378
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,980
plans for v6 and the ones who had

379
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:58,769
nothing to say we're kind of him you

380
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,459
know clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> by it that was a little bit</font>

381
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:05,250
embarrassing for them so we also have

382
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:08,849
the rirs as policy entrepreneurs going

383
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:12,829
out to both be the national governments

384
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:15,389
and in some cases in many cases going to

385
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,880
the the local ISPs and the local

386
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,519
operators to talk about b6 deployment

387
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,139
lack nick has obviously the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

388
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have circled here are lack Nick cases</font>

389
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:27,839
has done a bang-up job of reaching out

390
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,240
to companies throughout their region in

391
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of i think it was bolivia in</font>

392
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,279
particular they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

393
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:37,470
meeting of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ixp about forming an IXP</font>

394
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,540
and they said well gee while we have the

395
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,089
right people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room let's also talk</font>

396
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,560
about ipv6 and so they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

397
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:47,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of ipv6 allocations</font>

398
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,209
made in that country and get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and thinking about what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">their transition plan be having said</font>

401
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,430
that you're the king you can decide how

402
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,850
much of an impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> those particular cases</font>

403
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:07,870
have had on overall ipv6 adoption among

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:09,130
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> B so if it's the case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not</font>

405
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,480
certain that it is but if it's the case

406
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that direct government and ends</font>

407
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,050
partnership government practices aren't

408
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:19,360
the primary drivers of ipv6 what is what

409
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,430
has happened that has been the primary

410
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing where we can say that happens</font>

411
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,630
therefore we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 adopt but we need</font>

412
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,060
to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what are the incentives that</font>

413
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,120
drive people to enable ipv6 for their

414
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,569
companies and there are basically two

415
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,880
there's money and there's mystique so in

416
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:40,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first case the money tends to be</font>

417
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,939
more money individual firms where

418
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:46,260
companies network operators whether it's

419
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:49,180
ISP or a web content or cloud or hosting

420
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,069
where those companies determine on their

421
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,579
own that they have financial incentives

422
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,230
for deploying ipv6 in other cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

423
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,330
have but we're calling operational

424
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:02,589
epistemic communities and this is a term

425
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:06,880
that comes from older scientific bodies

426
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:09,760
and academic communities where the there

427
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">are bodies of knowledge sort of held by</font>

428
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,589
a particular bodies in our case its

429
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">operational the epistemic communities</font>

430
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,379
because of correspondents these are

primarily exists as a mailing list might

434
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,730
sound familiar and there might<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact</font>

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,340
you gain prestige by doing that and in

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,889
Luxembourg Peru Norway Switzerland the

461

that company said we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do v6 and</font>

466
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,990

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> incumbent has a significant market</font>

other cases United States and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany</font>

471

there is no single company that has

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,909
would move the needle but the country in

you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten but there's a</font>

on all the list in Germany it's a couple

it's you know the major<font color="#CCCCCC"> tellico</font>

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,159
because they've all deployed b6 is

483
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,230
actually in aggregate a significant

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,620
no single company but each individual

486

487
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,479
and this is the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if we if we go</font>

494
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,280
these epistemic communities where do we

495
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,370

figure

out whether that has a strong

with success and finally there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

ok

616
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:29,750
hello Tony Talbert comcast are there any

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:32,330
other examples of technology initiatives

that in the past or<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you think this model might apply to but</font>

620
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,280
that's that's a very interesting

621
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,160
question this all of this research<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">working paper so there's more work to be</font>

627
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,080
done on it and the data that it captures

628
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,909
is from a point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly six</font>

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,139
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I did update these numbers</font>

630
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:05,090
for to reflect current data whether it

631
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,430
applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> other technology initiatives</font>

632
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,590
would be sort of depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the overall</font>

633
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:14,260
policy model and probably recommend

Doug Montgomery NIST at least in the US

636
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,750
government's case the policy is actually

637
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:25,070
much broader than that it includes all

638
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:30,290
publicly accessible internet-facing

<font color="#CCCCCC">over a decade I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly tell you</font>

641
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:37,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is some deployment</font>

that that policy inspired but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,260
biggest things that's a problem right

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,770
now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually getting email services</font>

645
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:49,280
up over ipv6 and the real problem there

646
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:51,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the infrastructure of reputation</font>

647

modern you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know anti-spam aunty fishing</font>

649
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:02,210

650
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:05,900
any comment about ways forward with

651
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">those kind of technologies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

652
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,370
don't show up in any standards body but

653
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,669
seemed to be critical barriers to

654
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,899
deploying other services I would

655
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,640
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credit for being one</font>

656
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,760
of those ipv6 policy entrepreneurs that

we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also i</font>

wish that i had a solution for spam I

659
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:29,449
don't it does seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that there are</font>

660
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,340
certain assumptions that we can make may

661
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,550
be there may be assumptions that we can

662
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,360
make about buying reputation from one IP

663
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,049
address

664
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,299
two neighboring addresses so that now we

don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many addresses whether</font>

it's a 64 or a 60 or a 56 or a 48 any

667
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,030
given case and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we</font>

00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do there where maybe we can start</font>

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some correlation it requires more</font>

670

CPU more horsepower to do those

671
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,090
computations I that's the direction that

672
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,520
I'm sort of thinking and I haven't

673

written a formal submission to mog to

an expert who could tell me about

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,820
Japanese policy around v6 deployment so

696
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,549
because I was unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

697
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,899
who was fairly authoritative I just

didn't include a comparison of their

would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to include more detail in</font>

725
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,429
because of the strong government push

726
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,860
yeah that's that that's true from what i

727
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:42,740
understand and i absolutely agree with

728
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:45,469
you it's an it's a unique case because

729
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,870
of the private deployments of ipv6 where

730
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the rankings</font>

731
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was showing were from eric pincus</font>

732
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,900
data and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> using Google's data which</font>

733
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,929
measures the number of hits that they

734
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,180
get over ipv6 compared to ipv4 so it's

735
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:02,150
entirely likely that the representation

736
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:05,150
of v6 deployment from Japan to Google is

737
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,310
is not representative it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> well be</font>

738
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:10,400
that Japanese users don't go to Google

739
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:15,770
as much because as they do to Japanese

740
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:19,460
oriented sites but thank you yes hi

741
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:21,830
Casey<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCO verisign very interesting work</font>

742
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,370
and data and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look forward to the</font>

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:28,070
link with the rest of the results and

744
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:30,620
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ongoing work I was actually</font>

745
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:33,080
going to address Doug's question that he

746
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,689
he raised just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute ago so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

747
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,790
in partial direction that back at the

748
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,900
last night ugh i presented some of the

749
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:44,149
work that we've been doing and kind of

750
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:45,950
passive measurement of smtp spam over

751
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:49,160
ipv6 and some of the correlation we were

752
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,320
doing with ipv4 known blacklisted hosts

753
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,910
and that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a work that's kind</font>

754
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,919
of ongoing what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue</font>

755
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get participants where possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

756
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,930
the ideas in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nutshell to actually look</font>

757
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some of the ipv6 activity among known</font>

758
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:03,049
blacklisted hosts by using correlation

759
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,289
activity but

760
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:09,320
tween<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different attempts to send</font>

761
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:10,759
spam so slightly off topic but in

762
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,970
related to the general discussion of

763
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:15,799
this deployment and hurdles that are

764
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:18,320
there blocking ipv6 deployment are

765
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:20,119
making it more difficult you remind me

766
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if I were monarch one of the things</font>

767
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:25,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I would decree by rule is that all</font>

768
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:27,379
crl and OCS be servers must support ipv6

769
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,549
that would be good so that we could

770
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:30,529
check whether their certificates are

771
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:35,809
valid based when you have a v6 only

772
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:39,859
existed yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Angelico google just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off top</font>

773
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:41,928
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head when you get when you get</font>

774
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:45,049
government involved which comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

775
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:48,169
operator or company and say okay I want

776
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:50,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to support ipv6 it's quite possible</font>

777
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:53,269
that we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just deploy something let's</font>

778
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:57,229
let's get quad a record for a web

779
00:31:53,269 --> 00:32:00,139
service and let at answer to over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

780
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:02,769
pink for example yeah so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder if you</font>

781
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:04,998
looked at any correlation between

782
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:09,259
government involvement and let's say

783
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:11,840
ipv6 brokenness level the data that I

784
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:14,149
remember on brokenness level is is way

785
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,209
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the noise now compared to where</font>

786
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:19,998
it used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and I also had a caveat to</font>

787
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,440
say that the when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at specific</font>

788
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:23,149
policies they've been implemented I have

789
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,529
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjusted for time so some of them</font>

790
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:27,738
may be fairly recent policies that

791
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:30,350
haven't had time to take effect and I

792
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:32,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know other than the China gates</font>

793
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:34,759
where the Chinese government provided

794
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,889
incentives for isps to deploy a certain

795
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:39,200
number to deploy ipv6 to a certain

796
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:41,209
number of users it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost impossible</font>

797
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">for us to measure that outside of China</font>

798
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,769
so it's very difficult to tell how much

799
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,238
success they have had and what the

800
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:49,159
quality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that success is I know that</font>

801
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:51,769
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the google data we see</font>

802
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,960
fluctuations week-over-week from half a

803
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:56,090
percent to four percent and knowing what

804
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,440
the what the real level<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is is almost</font>

805
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,840
impossible to measure so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't been</font>

806
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to do any kind of good correlation</font>

807
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,799
of the quality of the point it's a very

808
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,629
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> question though I'd be</font>

809
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:10,039
thrilled<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have suggestions on how to</font>

810
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:11,539
adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you all very</font>

811
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,600
much
