1
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,570
morning everyone my name is Mike

2
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,160
Thompson

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,960
cyber security analyst at Argonne

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,259
National Lab

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,610
worried my background I entered the

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,779
industry as a operations technician in

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,759
Google's data center operations in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

8
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">mid 2000s and I've been doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety</font>

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,840
of IT consulting until coming to the lab

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:38,660
where my position is mostly focused on

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:40,160
research and analysis so what we're here

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,800
to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assessing</font>

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet resilience at a keynote and in</font>

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,629
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're studying right now</font>

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,949
is aspirin Virginia as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> keynote so this</font>

16
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:52,160
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a fairly non-technical</font>

17
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:53,960
presentation when talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,148
stuff working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the federal government</font>

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,649
now I'm used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to normally being sort of</font>

20
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,780
the most technical person in the room

21
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:03,530
and in this room I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the least</font>

22
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,470
technical person so<font color="#E5E5E5"> bear with me but</font>

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">please as you're listening do think of</font>

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,740
questions or ways that you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to contribute or even intuition level</font>

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,440
reactions to what we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

27
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,740
i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and devote as much of</font>

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,450
my time as I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> to opening it up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Q&A</font>

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,939
and I would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to hear what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

30
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,850
all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say about this and anyways</font>

31
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:27,320
so a little background on the lab

32
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,939
Argonne National Laboratory is a

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,669
federally funded research and

34
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:33,559
development center it's primarily run by

35
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,079
the department of energy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also do</font>

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,049
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of national security work for</font>

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,298
the Department of Homeland Security it

38
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:42,829
has an illustrious history starting out

39
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:46,000
with Manhattan<font color="#CCCCCC"> Project it's right</font>

40
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:48,469
outside of Chicago within our gonz

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
footprint I work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a center called the</font>

42
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:51,919
risk and infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> science center</font>

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,850
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily focused on</font>

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,799
infrastructure assurance evaluating the

45
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,000
resilience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and security of critical</font>

46
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,549
infrastructure targets around the

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,200
country traditionally the organization's

48
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:07,310
footprint has been on physical security

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,300
but we've recently expanded out into

50
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:13,220
computer security and cyber security and

51
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,770
primarily starting out trying to apply

52
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,470
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our expertise and physical</font>

53
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,180
security to the cyberrealms but also

54
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,100
extending that into cutting-edge

55
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,100
research we do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

56
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,989
moving target defense automotive hacking

57
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,129
like everyone we're doing big data

58
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:38,000
research all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font>

59
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:40,220
so my capacity here is to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,660
study<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're doing in concert with</font>

61
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of Homeland Security</font>

62
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,890
which is part of the study as part of

63
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,090
what's called the regional resiliency

64
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,160
assessment program so these assessments

65
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,560
which we call them are wraps for short

66
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,560
are done in a variety of critical

67
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,230
infrastructures typically in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font>

68
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,170
they've always been done on on physical

69
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,380
infrastructure things like power plants

70
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,569
dams water treatment facilities

71
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,920
pipelines this is the first one that

72
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:14,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've ever done on a piece of Internet</font>

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,359
infrastructure so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at a</font>

74
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,290
piece of Internet infrastructure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> due</font>

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ashburn's sort of unique history</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

76
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,629
stuck out as the place that was most

77
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,140
well suited to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of process so</font>

78
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:32,090
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general with these resiliency</font>

79
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,160
assessments we look at downstream

80
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,670
consequences to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifeline sectors and</font>

81
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,430
the national economy so in our case if

82
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:43,100
the aspirin area<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center cluster</font>

83
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,099
were to disappear from the face of the

84
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,790
planet what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to lifeline</font>

85
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:53,420
sectors such as energy water<font color="#E5E5E5"> emergency</font>

86
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,599
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> transportation also we would</font>

87
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,548
like to look at sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a higher level</font>

88
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,918
what would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet you</font>

90
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:08,930
ving being a very resilient protocol and

91
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,849
you know we all know that it by and

92
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,010
large TCP has done a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great job of</font>

93
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:17,209
routing around failures even pretty

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find about the amount of traffic</font>

interesting trace routes during the

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,919
hurricane sandy outages basically just

187
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,620
tracking what happened when new york and

188
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,740
new jersey went offline so you see when

189
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,660
we switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> from blue to green there is</font>

190
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,370
where most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic that was going</font>

191

through new<font color="#E5E5E5"> york and new jersey gets</font>

192
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,250
rerouted to ashburn so one of our

193
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,070
hypotheses in this study is sort of from

194
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,990
a larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> doomsday perspective is if the</font>

195
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,280
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing were to happen to ashburn</font>

197
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,949
during the hurricane sandy time period

198
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,840
that that same traffic routed back

199
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,880
through new<font color="#E5E5E5"> york and new jersey the load</font>

that normally goes through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ashburn would</font>

201
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,630
start to strain routers and connections

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new york</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and new jersey area so</font>

203
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,420
what we're interested in trying to

204
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,939
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out is at what point would that</font>

205

load become so great that critical

206
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,740
services start to fail or that internet

207
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,839
traffic slowdowns you know start to

208
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,120
impact services you know running<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

209

them particularly things like voice over

212
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,560

219
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,570
we're here at nanog and that I really

220
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,220
fought to make sure that we have a

225
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,200
government has been really terrible at

being behind the curve on this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

227
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,940
stuff and government comes in late and

228
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,920
makes regulations that don't make any

sense that aren't informed based on what

230

<font color="#E5E5E5">good opportunity here to try and get</font>

234
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,850
focused on traditional critical

235
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,250
infrastructure as i said but also sort

236
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,839
of playing whack Amole with the most

<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerable pieces of our infrastructure</font>

238

to get feedback even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's you know</font>

245
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:29,980
just based on your intuition and we're

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,200
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anything like data data</font>

that may exist in the industry we're

249
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,070
working on developing some modeling

does the majority of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that traffic go</font>

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,190
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some ideas on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

254
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,040
collect that data including you know

255
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,870
more traditional ideas but also

256
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,150
utilizing curated data sets like the

257
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,010
patella geography data set but we also

258
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,180
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to try and replicate things</font>

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,120
that are already happening in the

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,189
private industry you know because at

261
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,130
least my opinion is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys will</font>

262
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,420
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it better than we will so anything</font>

263
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,089
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us we're</font>

264
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,670
very interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear it so you know</font>

265
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:15,100
how do we model a regional outage during

266
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,290
a slow down at what point you know in

267
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the congestion control process do things</font>

268
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:23,370
like VoIP become unusable

269
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:26,160
and impact emergency services what scale

270
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,710
or what scale of outage or disaster

271
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,779
would be serious enough to a hamper or

272
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:35,730
to defeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCPS resilience so as I said</font>

273
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,529
we're looking at traditional data

274
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,970
collection avenues things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> sustained</font>
