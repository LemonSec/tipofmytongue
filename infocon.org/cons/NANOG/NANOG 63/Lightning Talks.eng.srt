1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,470
up next we have our lightning talks we

2
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:21,169
have two presentations the first one

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charles Lee on ipv4 redistributions</font>

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,220
secondary markets

5
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,570
you

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,820
good afternoon I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

7
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,710
about something which is vitally

8
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,559
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you you already know</font>

9
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,830
it you may not know it in quite the same

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,550
way the single most important asset<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

11
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:30,130
your corporations is your IP numbers

12
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,200
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you function without them you</font>

13
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,899
can buy all the routers and fiber and

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,530
cross connects and whatever else but

15
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:41,229
absent numbers you don't have a business

16
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,000
so without further ado we're going to

17
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:45,070
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some numbers about the</font>

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,229
numbers first let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

19
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,350
long-standing myth that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is</font>

20
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:54,550
running out of numbers this<font color="#CCCCCC"> myths was</font>

21
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,830
started around 1995 and the reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

22
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,840
that the rirs the regional internet

23
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,619
registries are impact running out of

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,759
numbers they've gotten 3.7 billion

25
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:08,410
numbers through the ion of functions and

26
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,840
have parsed out the preponderance of

27
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,970
them some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them still have some</font>

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,610
numbers for example AP nick has a

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,739
reasonable supply but it's trapped in

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,739
policy so unless you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to live</font>

31
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:23,320
with a slash 22 they cannot fulfill your

32
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:27,220
needs each region has its own rules

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,220
about allocation but in the Aaron region

34
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,890
for example they're down to less than an

35
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">eighth less than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> half of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eighth and</font>

36
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,700
declining difficult to predict when they

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,500
will actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> exhaust but with the 4.2</font>

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,750
billion by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way these will all be</font>

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,140
rough numbers rather than specifics of

40
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,560
the 4.2 billion numbers that are in the

41
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:54,488
address table 595 million were set aside

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,470
special purpose by RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3.7</font>

43
00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:01,480
billion iono has allocated 3.7 billion

44
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,900
that means I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna is effectively empty</font>

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:09,160
they're doing cleanup but essentially

46
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:12,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pool is gone as a consequence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,340
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists that the rars cannot</font>

48
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,989
fulfill your needs for additional number

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,660
this means that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business environment</font>

50
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:23,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">within which you operate as changed or</font>

51
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,760
ever and always this is a new business

52
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,920
reality

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,730
this is neither good nor bad it is a

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:34,390
fact so thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff Houston we've had</font>

55
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,129
a lot of conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to put</font>

56
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,488
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> some numbers about the numbers</font>

57
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:41,739
for example allocated but unadvertised

58
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,510
there's about a billion numbers which

59
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,950
have been allocated and don't appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

60
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,530
the general purpose routing tables

61
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,018
anyway that doesn't mean they're not

62
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,769
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means they're not being used</font>

63
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:58,090
or not used in the general public

64
00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:01,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet a second category which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

65
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,519
under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> research paper title which</font>

66
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,590
only an academic could love the title

67
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,840
being capturing ghosts predicting the

68
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,170
unused ipv4 space by empowering

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,870
unobserved addresses after digging

70
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the title and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 27 pages of</font>

71
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,930
the analysis approximately 1 point 1

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,740
billion numbers are advertised but

73
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:28,570
unused this means there is approximately

74
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,710
2.1 billion numbers out of 3.7 that are

75
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,770
not in use in the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet today</font>

76
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:38,020
now the two things together have

77
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,820
implications for you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll draw that</font>

78
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,190
as a conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> in just a moment but</font>

79
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's deal with the second myth burst</font>

80
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,440
there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 is the answer to internet</font>

81
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,979
number needs this was the mantra which

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">raided again around 1995 and</font>

83
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:02,139
unfortunately it doesn't help a great

84
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:06,340
deal because b6 is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> replacement or not</font>

85
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:09,699
an extension of ipv4 it is a brand new

86
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:13,270
internet the two are incompatible on the

87
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,740
wire so we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

88
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,930
transition we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go from the</font>

89
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,599
public internet it is exists today in v4

90
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,060
to a public internet that exists in v6

91
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:25,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that transition is going to take a</font>

92
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,539
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and billions of dollars not</font>

93
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:31,690
fortunately it's not billions of any one

94
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:33,810
person's dollars but there's a lot of

95
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be spent here</font>

96
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,870
dual stack which is our generally

97
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,840
accepted most predominantly accepted

98
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:46,940
means to do this transition means that

99
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:51,929
you need both before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 numbers</font>

100
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,639
neither is sufficient so that means we

101
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,850
have to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how long will dual</font>

102
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,919
stack persistent now I took a shot and

103
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,139
said it will persist at least until

104
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">native be six packets or eighty to</font>

105
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,960
ninety percent of the traffic in the

106
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet I would also suggest it we may</font>

107
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,039
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit longer than that for</font>

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,710
other reasons but this is a lightning

109
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,450
talk so we're going to move on so given

110
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">these two facts sets let's draw some</font>

111
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:22,139
obvious conclusions<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 does nothing to</font>

112
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:25,560
mitigate before<font color="#E5E5E5"> number needs until v6</font>

113
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:29,580
rules the internet before is not going

114
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,950
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime soon if ever again there's</font>

115
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,550
some reasons why before might persist or

116
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,990
a very very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time and the</font>

117
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">obvious conclusion out of those two</font>

118
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">statements is that redistribution of</font>

119
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:46,560
unused v4 number blocks is necessary for

120
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,419
the foreseeable you again this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

121
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,240
this is not a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing or a bad thing</font>

122
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:55,740
this is a reality statement we're going

123
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to redistribute numbers so how</font>

124
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that redistribution going and what</font>

125
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:05,280
are the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are being employed</font>

126
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,020
well it's being done by free market the

127
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,729
laws and forces of supply and demand

128
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:15,810
rule demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> ie need is self determined</font>

129
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:18,960
by the buyer if you go and you go to an

130
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,970
AR AR and say I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 16 and he can't</font>

131
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,669
fulfill it<font color="#E5E5E5"> your need did not go away</font>

132
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,729
it's the means by which you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be getting it through redistribution</font>

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:38,729
in that environment demand being set by

the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the buyers and the other side</font>

lower the prices this is basic marketing

141
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,830
amex right supply and demand will come

142
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,520
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> equilibrium around price that is a</font>

143
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact so in theory all three point seven</font>

144
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,430
billion numbers in the general<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose</font>

145
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet are available the question is</font>

146
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:09,770
at what price now that's theory because

the price of acquiring the numbers from

<font color="#E5E5E5">the ambiguity about technology you'll</font>

are continually updating a rare accuracy

within the region and within other

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,600
regions have remained reasonable and

254
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,890
fairly stable there has not been an

has not oster a nightmare scenario these

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,410
now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about acquisition not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to join the grab so first you need</font>

to advocate<font color="#E5E5E5"> for global registry policies</font>

that are supportive<font color="#E5E5E5"> of redistribution</font>

311
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:45,120
redistribution is incessant any policy

312
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,540
that that works against that necessity

313
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,690
works against your interest but you need

314
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:54,900
to advocate for things which help

315
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:57,140
redistribution not limited registry

316
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,480
accuracy is essential to registry arm

317
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,699
relevance an inaccurate registry is less

318
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,700
than helpful so if accuracy is not

319
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,700
improving go get policies in place I

320
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,430
help make it better and third start

321
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,860
educating your suits yes we know that's

322
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,680
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do poke</font>

323
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,480
suits are necessary and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,270
need them you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> your finance people</font>

325
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,820
you need your lawyers you need your

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,380
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they do not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a clue what</font>

327
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,290
you're talking about when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you walk in</font>

328
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,439
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bot so start the</font>

329
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:34,300
education process early that's it if

330
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,300
there's any questions to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be glad to pay</font>

331
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:48,920
not really a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to comments</font>

332
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:52,040
first of all these four does v6 does

333
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,079
nothing to mitigate v4 give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp six</font>

334
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,349
give me the ability to do more teeny

00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">over v6 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

336
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,570
because I can free up about 20,000 IPS

337
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,910
on my network secondly speculators have

338
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,580
not appeared you obviously haven't heard

339
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,410
of a glycol blue hang the reason that

340
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not seeing speculators in this</font>

341
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,800
market is because right now they're

342
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,380
coming and taking the space out of

<font color="#CCCCCC">AfriNIC through fraudulent applications</font>

344
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,950
and speculating on that we are seeing

the speculators they've taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

350
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:38,120
redistribution if you're having

351
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,150
speculators or bad actors coming into

352
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,459
the registries I don't question that now

353
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:48,170
that number blocks have market value bad

354
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,790
actors will appear that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that's</font>

355
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,310
one of the protection things I was

00:17:52,310 --> 00:18:05,020
oops stop any other questions no let's

358
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,020
go get some beer

359
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:17,920
sorry not quite yet on the beer but soon

360
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,320
we have one more lightning talk on the

365
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:54,730
this will be one more pass on very

366
00:18:50,500 --> 00:19:00,010
popular topic today did also big gates

367
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:02,470
and first the question whose people

368
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:07,780
being present sir being hit by those

369
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:11,050

<font color="#E5E5E5">a look at this list of by quite usual</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> product balls so we decided to take</font>

381
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,760
closer look what they look like how's

382
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:03,370
the mirror and the current apv for a

383
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,760
visit so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> waited there and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

384
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:10,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">ens looks like nowadays as you can see</font>

385
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:14,530
maximum amplification are multiple

386
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,350
multiplier of 60 is almost unattainable

387
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:22,980
so we are as community did a really good

388
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:28,480
job eliminate the threat congratulation

389
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:37,120
ntp well doesn't look that good still

390
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there chair can not coming SNMP</font>

391
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have no idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what these three peaks</font>

392
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:47,350
are honestly if you have any ideas why

393
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:50,020
this or present<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our measurement just</font>

394
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,270
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me afterwards and let's get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">started</font>

396
00:20:52,270 --> 00:21:01,790
SSD the largest peak is 78 this is a

maximum amplification multiplier of DNS

398
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:11,960
and this looks big budget so we also

399
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,890
measure it this product also<font color="#E5E5E5"> houses a</font>

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:19,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">cave are on the time scale in between</font>

junipers and october thieves of the past

402
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:32,090
year and what we found is 100 1.6

403

billion packets for<font color="#E5E5E5"> first stage for</font>

every first stage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack back even if</font>

405
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:49,280
it's purely theoretical still<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow right</font>

406
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:53,690
second thing this is the piece clearly

407
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:57,680
is the king of amplifications the ntp is

408
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:02,210
down there on the bottom and there it

409
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:07,720
comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> note well not notes a</font>

410
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:10,460
hypothesis ah why we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not dead yet</font>

411
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,660
possibly because we were lucky enough to

412
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:18,950
have bad protocol such as SS b 2 b CJ aj

413
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:22,130
add parameters of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and it's</font>

414
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not about how many packets you</font>

415
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:28,790
can generate even theoretically it's how

416
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,540
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets will arrive to the target</font>

417
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:36,230
of your attack so it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about knowing</font>

418
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">balaji in effort that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are lucky</font>

419
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:42,110
enough stay alive and functional even

420
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:51,020
such severe problems with amplification

421
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:55,639
in current if poor at its fate so what

422
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:58,870
we only make a bit will we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just lie</font>

423
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,060
dormant for next 3 years and see this

424

amplification stack<font color="#CCCCCC"> returned with</font>

425
