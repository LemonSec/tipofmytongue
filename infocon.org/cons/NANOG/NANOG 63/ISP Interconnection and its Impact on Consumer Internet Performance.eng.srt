1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:14,820
and next we've got a Colin coming up to

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:21,130
speak to us about what's he calling it

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:23,259
measurement measurement something it's

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,589
called ISP interconnection and its

5
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:27,970
impact on internet performance and you

6
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:30,869
can use the clip on or you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:36,100
podium it's either way is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fine</font>

8
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,560
click or something I think the

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:49,149
alternative the alternative the best is

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:50,890
buying into other people's business so

11
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,440
just a word about where I'm coming from

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,190
I'm on Anderson I am among other things

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">an advisor and a researcher with my lab</font>

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,519
as I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversations with people I</font>

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,120
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the base knowledge</font>

16
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,640
but lab is not what but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd</font>

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,260
hope to be so to spend a small amount of

out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. transit providers we've</font>

named a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> I left off a couple we've</font>

47
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,379
rapidly expanded the number of sight so

48
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,340
that's going to factor into a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:32,620
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

50
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,019
today but we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a larger</font>

international president we've expanded

52

in into Canada we've expanded into

53
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,179
Africa we've expanded into Asia and so

54
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,670
this means effectively more granular

55
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,769
data for interesting research questions

56
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,670
that are not just specific to the United

57
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:54,910

58
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,149
stress the openness<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough I it this is</font>

are here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people so sort of talk</font>

verbatim but just to go over the

66
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,239

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,359
large perspectives one of our tools the

the NDT tool the network diagnostic tool

73
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,650
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that a lot of you guys</font>

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">know is actually the the version that</font>

76
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,790
actually integrated into another a

77
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,380
number of clients that allow us a sort

78
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,548
of pervasive measurement across the

79
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">United States so for example we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

80
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,930
the preferred measurement platform for

81
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:58,419
the Greek regulators we have been used

82
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,079
for the Sam knows platform in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United</font>

84
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,690
so we have about a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sixty</font>

85
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:11,819
thousand tests per day coming from about

86
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,620
a hundred a hundred thousand clients

87
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,048
160,000 ya from comin from about a

88
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:22,150
hundred unique clients basically every

89
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:24,340
country across the world as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

90
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,320
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what this gives us is because we're</font>

91
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,090
in the transit providers we can start to

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,530
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

93
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">interconnection performance between</font>

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,909
major access ISPs

95
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,250
and we can build a sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

96
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,070
methodology based off of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font>

97
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,130
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see for example that a user's</font>

98
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:45,310
having having issues with with their

99
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:48,420
connectivity we see for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example rising</font>

100
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,460
round trip times rising packet

101
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,770
retransmissions or loss if we see

102
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,090
decreasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> three throughput we can do a</font>

103
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,859
comparative methodology in order to

104
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,780
start to isolate where potentially

105
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,870
within the network path that this is

106
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,799
occurring so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access provider</font>

107
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:12,370
a transit provider ex we can start to

108
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,860
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so from a to another transit</font>

109
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,270
provider why what is the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the</font>

110
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,700
performance look like does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

111
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,250
over time is it does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> decrease do we</font>

112
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,039
see loss rates that we would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font>

113
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,650
within a well<font color="#CCCCCC"> provisioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network if if</font>

114
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,660
we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that okay you know to this other</font>

115
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,739
transit provider that it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

116
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,600
fairly fairly well fairly stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> e we</font>

117
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">can say okay then the problem isn't</font>

118
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,910
happening in the edge network itself of

119
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,940
the access is P so this leaves us with

120
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:46,090
two possible other choices of more or

121
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,950
less so we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> another segment of</font>

122
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">our population because we have a fair</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tests and we can say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

124
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,090
another access provider connecting to

125
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,700
that that first transit<font color="#CCCCCC"> is P</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transit is</font>

126
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,989
px what does that performance look like

127
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,390
if if in this case we see fairly normal

128
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,910
performance then we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say okay if</font>

129
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,640
it's not if it's not the access is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P</font>

130
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,950
it's not the transit is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P then maybe</font>

131
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,810
it's the inner connection and as we take

132
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,789
segments of the population and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

133
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,340
this over time and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this across a</font>

134
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,650
large sample and we take this across

135
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,119
other sites then we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say okay</font>

136
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe their inner connection issues</font>

137
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,370
maybe there are provisioning issues

138
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,620
going on here and unfortunately at least

139
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,960
in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States we do have a large</font>

140
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,290
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> sample every month we get for</font>

141
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,330
example for comcast about 62,000 test I

142
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,790
think actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the numbers provided</font>

143
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,159
on this are lower than than they

144
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,260
actually are but we start to get a lot

145
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,760
of data from a diverse set of the

146
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,890
locations in

147
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,500
in the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this allows us</font>

148
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:53,469
to start matching the provisioning and

149
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,810
and you know we recognize that both

150
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,670
transfer test for example isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

151
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,620
complete saturation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pipe so when</font>

152
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,420
I give cert to give numbers I'm not

153
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,250
claiming that this is the entirety of

154
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,740
what people can push but for a single

155
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,780
threaded TCP connection that is trying

156
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,090
to push as much data as quickly as

157
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible this is reflective and I think</font>

158
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,570
that this is reflective of a large

159
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,550
portion of of how people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

160
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:20,700
internet the applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

161
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">using so we rely on bass lines you know</font>

162
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:27,789
that methodology was the assertion of

163
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,760
different baselines so we can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> m lab</font>

164
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,730
had an interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in New</font>

165
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:38,110
York where we had a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good a B</font>

166
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:41,610
scenario as I showed you where a was was

167
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,950
the transit provider internet and B was

168
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">cogent and so okay we can say there is</font>

169
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,550
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting discussion going on in</font>

170
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,770
the United States currently in the

171
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,450
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy realm about the</font>

172
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,969
provisioning of inter connection and how

173
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:58,349
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used in in in terms of</font>

174
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:01,090
business negotiations and other other

175
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:05,290
idiosyncrasies outside the technical

176
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,700
realm you know how does that baseline

177
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,820
work if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

178
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:13,330
internap is not a primary vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some</font>

179
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,400
of the applications and dispute how does

180
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,440
their performance look like and so in

181
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,969
New York we take the four access

182
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
providers that we had the most amount of

183
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,650
data for which was time warner Comcast

184
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,500
Verizon and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cablevision how does that</font>

185
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:29,349
performance look well like any any data

186
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,480
there's jitter but there's consistency

187
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,290
there's a there's a there's a trend over

188
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:39,580
time and so we say okay this seems to be

189
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,559
a fairly stable a set of

190
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,890
interconnections for for a transit

191
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:47,410
provider okay so we assume then that

192
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> internap is fairly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well provisioned</font>

193
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:54,189
so let's take a baseline of<font color="#E5E5E5"> access eyes</font>

194
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,760
please let's take a an access isp that

195
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,320
has not been publicly accused of has not

196
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,150
had public issues having to do

197
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,580
with inner connection actually in some

198
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,470
cases has an infrastructure set up with

199
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,990
that would avoid the problem and so

200
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,600
let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> cablevision and cablevision</font>

201
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,900
to koja are beasts item this comparative

202
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,840
so we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> is stability more or less</font>

203
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,970
again jitter some strange things maybe a

204
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,630
few research papers for the spikes but

205
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,790
nothing drastic and and I want to I want

206
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,280
to caution that in this we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

207
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,680
median and so the median is subject to

208
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,360
very extreme behavior when you're

209
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,620
visualizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's useful as an</font>

210
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,240
indicator but but it's it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

211
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,100
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into account and if you see</font>

212
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,490
fluctuations those fluctuations are

213
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,330
bound to show in the data you're bound

214
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:49,630
to see actually a prelude<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the sort of</font>

215
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,790
performance so okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is cable</font>

216
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">vision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we have left is we have</font>

217
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:58,390
time warner cable we have comcast and we

218
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:01,270
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> verizon against koja</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what do</font>

219
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">we see well the differences are pretty</font>

220
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,160
stark and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as much as both</font>

221
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,970
throughput might have its have its

222
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,790
problems when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start to see basically</font>

223
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,620
you know ninety percent degradation over

224
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> median in the in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the course of a</font>

225
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,930
month things going<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong and when you</font>

226
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,719
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability in the normal cases and</font>

227
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,689
you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that basically within a</font>

228
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,540
month the the performance for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

229
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,680
user population changes all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden</font>

230
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">that starts to tell you that there are</font>

231
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,229
underlying changes in within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

232
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,600
and so what we see is is is in the case

233
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">of certain transit providers that the</font>

234
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,970
access ISPs very quickly to degrade in

235
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,860
performance and this this is manifest

236
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,630
across all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parameters that one</font>

237
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,940
would generally expect this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

238
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:53,050
decrease in throughput this is an

239
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,820
increase of loss this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a an increase</font>

240
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,500
of round trip time they manifest

241
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,480
differently but what you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

242
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,670
is a change in the throughput that is

243
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,160
drastic it is not subtle we are not

244
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,469
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for subtle indicators like forty</font>

245
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,040
percent change we are looking at eighty

246
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:12,470
percent change and so okay this is one

247
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,920
site that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be a</font>

248
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:19,250
a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a segment of a network</font>

249
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is shared but what we see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact M</font>

250
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,070
lab has about four sites at this time

251
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,560
located in cogent what we see is very

252
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,290
quickly across all cochin sites we start

253
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,290
to see declining performance the<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

254
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:36,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">are rapid and they are more or less</font>

255
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:39,230
related they aren't synchronous but they

256
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:44,390
are similar in nature all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> excess</font>

257
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:47,510
ISP is starting in spring of 2013 start

258
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:52,130
to experience strong degradation of

259
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:55,939
performance 22 cogent in this case these

260
00:11:52,130 --> 00:12:00,620
are AT&T CenturyLink Comcast Time Warner

261
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:05,860
and Verizon you know you might read

262
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:10,010
about these these issues in the news so

263
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:11,360
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting behavior but one of</font>

264
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that's a little bit more</font>

265
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,770
illustrative is ok let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start to bend</font>

266
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,650
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a month put this within a</font>

267
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,840
month and bin it day over day well what

268
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,790
we see is exactly what what we would

269
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,560
expect within a within a well

270
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,579
provisioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network more or less you</font>

271
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,910
should see stability across time there

272
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:35,450
isn't a competition of resources these

273
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,370
these factors sort of stay consistent so

274
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,140
we assume then when people are starting

275
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,300
to compete over a fixed amount of

276
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,250
resources that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not high enough to</font>

277
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,000
accommodate their user base that we're

278
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,830
going to see behavior like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this which is</font>

279
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,660
as people are loading<font color="#E5E5E5"> up their</font>

280
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,880
over-the-top services when they get home

281
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,350
at night<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

282
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,260
through the same congested

283
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">interconnection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the sudden</font>

284
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,830
performance goes down for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

285
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,530
because you know we share the same

286
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,350
interconnection as all of these all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

287
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">these services this is not obviously you</font>

288
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,130
know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's not going to</font>

289
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,470
affect one particular service it's going

290
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,510
to affect everything behind that service

291
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,840
so incidentally that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> M lab starts</font>

292
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,660

cogent what we see is is is similarly

295
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,100
extreme we see that

296
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,410
in the early morning hours that you

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,170
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would expect out of cable or a</font>

304
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:54,410
is that seven o'clock to 11pm hours that

00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:58,740
the FCC defines as as on peak hours and

306
00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:00,360
and when it gets low it gets low in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

raising round-trip times rising round

315

across a number of the transit ISPs and

it might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even be connected with it</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see across the</font>

323
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,660
that during the peak hours all of a

324
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,660
sudden the throughput is drastically

325
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,600
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is in off-peak</font>

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,980
way is our sampling population so so

328
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,660
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting about off-peak</font>

329
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,550
hours to as they start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to auger that</font>

330
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,160
there's there there are capacity

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,979
constraints within the network if you

332
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,670
can see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's seen the</font>

333

darker is the on peak hours the lighter

334
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:23,040
at the top is the off-peak hours and

335
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:26,340
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle is what ends up being</font>

336
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,770
the median of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and so what we see</font>

337
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,690
is this consistently across time that

338
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:34,010
this sort of this sort of behavior that

339
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:37,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">we saw here is repeated month over month</font>

340
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,470
we also start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see towards the it</font>

341
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,880
towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> the summer</font>

342
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,040

343
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,740
resolutions within these capacity

344
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,589
constraints so again not to pick on

345
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,230
another we see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Verizon in the case of level 3</font>

347
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,940
what's interesting is it is is that this

348
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what we've seen is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most ongoing</font>

349
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:03,230
we've seen the higher round trip times

350
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:06,709
we've seen the similar changes in

351
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:10,200
throughput in the anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you know</font>

352
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:13,440
going down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> less than what the the</font>

353
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,830
broadband definition would be and we

354
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,080
also see at some point a packet

355
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,990
retransmission rates that are around six

356
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,580
percent so fairly high failures within

357
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,030
the network and these are also the

358
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,980
median and so this this means that a lot

359
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other people are you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50th</font>

360
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,940

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:38,339
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show you up here same</font>

362
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:42,750
same sort of pattern degradation over

time<font color="#CCCCCC"> remediation the the peak hours</font>

364
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,830
being a really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense of something</font>

365
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,859
happening in the network I'd also note

366
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,420
that what our measurement<font color="#E5E5E5"> witter</font>

367
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,720
measurements are possibly showing in

368
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,599
this case is a small remediation through

369
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,000
possibly adding capacity in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the point</font>

370
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,220
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interconnection you see this across</font>

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,470
time especially during the spring we

372
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,730
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really say that it's we don't you</font>

373
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,160
know make that claim within the paper

374
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,630
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is it is a likely</font>

375
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,530
hypothesis for why you see brief

376
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:19,800
improvements of performance in the

377
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:21,839
spring of 2013 and this continues I can

378
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,810
pull out some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we'll do</font>

379
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,319
more blog<font color="#E5E5E5"> post on this but just just</font>

380
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:30,570
because one one application has has made

381
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,730
different arrangements we still see

382
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:36,899
these diurnal changes in performance

383
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:41,120
behavior that are experienced by real

384
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:44,880
users and real samples of performance by

385
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:48,989
performed by the users so just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> blaber</font>

386
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,940
the point what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to show is is you</font>

387

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,550

392

kanay infrastructure that is causing

395
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,450
this sort of behavior for as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it</font>

396
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,790
is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely not a technical issue</font>

397
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,640
it's likely you know a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight or</font>

layer 9 problem that is causing<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests</font>

399
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,650
and technical manifestations and so you

400
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we if we've been all of our</font>

401
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,570
measurements together these are these

are put over different blocks of<font color="#CCCCCC"> megs</font>

403
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:35,740
per second but you know that the eyeball

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:39,790
the eyeball test is in any case if if on

405

this you see more red than than more red

410
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,240
that's it that's a better that's a

411
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,200
better situation that's a better and

412
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,470
less congested relationship so we can

413
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,230
take this and we can we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

414
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,900
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a grid of matching access</font>

415
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,600
ISPs and transit ISPs and what we see is

416
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,720
okay there is no transit is be in this

417
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,290
situation that is universally bad there

418
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,420
is at least two or so access ISPs that

419
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem to have normal performance so this</font>

420
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,610
is probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening within the</font>

421
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:26,110
transit is P this is there's probably no

422
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:30,820
bad transit transit provider within our

423
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,830
sample so we can also take<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay another</font>

424
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,200
an access ISP and we can do the same

425
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,210
thing we find situations in which the

426
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,840
inner connection with particular transit

427
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,350
providers are are well performing of

428
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:47,560
course I there's also a DSL which

429
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,020
unfortunately does not have a good go at

430
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:53,440
it which always looks bad in this slide

431
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:56,080
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point being is is that in this</font>

432
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,000
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see that there's there that</font>

433
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,560
it has to be happening at the points of

434
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,200
inner connection between these

435
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,139
particular relationships so one of the

436
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,750
other points that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring home</font>

something must have happened within this

rapid performance increase across all of

sudden what had happened was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

457
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,390
there was a prioritization scheme that

458
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,220
was in effect and by retaining all this

459
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,260
data we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,630
prioritization scheme that was not

publicly disclosed now this isn't the

00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,790
only way of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic management the</font>

466
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,939

you know just to to conclude all of the

tools if you disagree with the

methodology with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> findings everything</font>

472
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,570
is available publicly as I mentioned all

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our data is CC 0 we've gone to the</font>

474
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,490
point of even taking the intermediate

475
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,430
results putting them putting them up the

476
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:52,300
code in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reproduce this is on</font>

launched ed the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> observatory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

479
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,470
tries to reproduce these in real time

480
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,970
that's available the code for that is

481
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,100
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and and to conclude what</font>

482
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,540
we're able to do is add a third party

483
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,230
start to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you'd only</font>

484
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:14,050
previously be able to see with mr TG so

485
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:16,630
I graphs and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting from</font>

486
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,129
a public policy standpoint because this

487
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,050
is starts to be comparative

488
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:23,230
data that isn't reliant on a particular

489
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,450
service provider or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the argument of</font>

490
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,490
the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who holds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data because</font>

491
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:32,320
this is this sort of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

492
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:34,150
had been pretty well-kept based off of

493
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,159
non-disclosure agreements based off of

494
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,750
commercial interests and this is the

495
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,000
point of measurement lab is to start to

496
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,960
put transparency through the use of open

497
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,920
measurement and an in collaborative

498
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:51,090
projects so with that I should hope that

499
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,090
there are questions and accusations

500
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
seriously

501
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:06,170
did i insult anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

502
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,970
you
