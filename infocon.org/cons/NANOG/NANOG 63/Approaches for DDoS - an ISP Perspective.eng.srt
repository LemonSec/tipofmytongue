you can drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> guide great we thought we</font>

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,750
would come up here and tell you a little

<font color="#CCCCCC">bit about what we learned over the years</font>

you'll see that on the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">speaking specifically about them but</font>

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,800
what we've learned along the way yeah

20
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,899
just add my name<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Auggie me if I'm a</font>

talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you about detox mitigation and</font>

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,310
beer is almost there<font color="#CCCCCC"> beer in gear is</font>

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,049
almost coming but beers right around the

26
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,360
corner yet so just survive this and

27
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:17,239
you'll be good one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

28
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">noticed as a parallel was that d dos and</font>

29
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:24,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry adidas kind of looked like</font>

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,660
the school system and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development of</font>

31
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,149
the school system and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by</font>

32
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example here we all start</font>

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:35,540
with little one and was little<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones we</font>

34
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,370
get them items that they can learn stuff

35
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,950
they learned in aesthetic properties and

36
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,890
stuff like that from those so they do it

37
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,108
all themselves and we do it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-house</font>

38
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:49,279
that is really not much different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a</font>

39
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:50,900
customer who's dealing with mitigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">on what a lot of people have done is</font>

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,859
basically deploy a device such as an

42
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,560
intrusion detection and prevention

43
00:02:54,859 --> 00:03:00,530
system it's very easy to set up it works

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,570
great for a small attacks what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idps</font>

45
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,150
box will do is will identify malicious

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:08,780
activity will log information will make

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,109
an attempt to block traffic and will

48
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,989
report next and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the school or</font>

49
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:17,269
the home school they realized that the

50
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:19,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">little one is growing up and they don't</font>

education<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs to take place that</font>

53
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,609
little so what happens is they start to

54
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,380
pool the resources but they build this

55
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:29,510
little single room<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shack they get it out</font>

56
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,549
there everyone travels whatever distance

57
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,349
it takes to get there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to be</font>

58
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:34,510
able to educate their children or get

59
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,679
their children<font color="#E5E5E5"> educated and the</font>

60
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">neighborhood itself is completely</font>

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,069
responsible and this is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> step</font>

62
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:46,189
that many isps take in mitigating DDoS

63
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:49,369
attacks however when you start

64
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:53,000
aggregating customers or in this case

65
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,920
students you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also start at bringing in</font>

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,569
an element that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or an access to an</font>

67
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,149
element<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily want</font>

69
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,689
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you find that in the</font>

00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">modern school system there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are street</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spraying on local resources they</font>

73
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,900
you know that but they're organized and

74
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:18,259
they have mal-intent a quite a bit like

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:20,269
DDoS attacks and to deal with the

76
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">description in neighborhood what many</font>

77
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,289
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done is basically deploy a</font>

78
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,690
sinkhole controller or also known as

79
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:29,810
remote triggered black hole filtering

80
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,360
and that's what you just saw just a

81
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,030
second ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a minute ago to be a few</font>

82
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,550
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago with what we were talking</font>

83
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,989
about the last speaker who's talking

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">about ways to implement these black</font>

85
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,750
balls yes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that works very</font>

86
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,570
high level is on your sinkhole

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,060

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:31,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks there's a way to rerouted traffic</font>

102
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,009
to a sinkhole controller for an

103
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,050
environment for additional analysis

104
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,240
you're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at net flow is</font>

105
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,280
flowing information you can set up an

106
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,270
interface ACL just to see if you're

107
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,909
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> any hits on ICMP UDP or TCP so</font>

108
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:49,580
basically return the whole network into

109
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:51,090
this IDs type thing that shells traffic

110
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,740
down

111
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,810
some of the advantages of the sinkhole

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,470
controller is it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> sickly very easy</font>

113
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,150
to set up it's an expensive you just put

114
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,850
a router in and talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the rest of the</font>

115
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:07,090
network some of the disadvantages you

116
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,039
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete the attack big</font>

117
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,409
disadvantage is when you get a DDoS

118
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,409
attack you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of traffic it a lot</font>

119
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,360
of alarms you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at net flow</font>

120
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,680
information to find what IP address is

121
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,690
getting attacked then you go to the

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,580
sinkhole controller you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

123
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,039
deployed a route and gets propagated and

124
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,530
finally the traffic gets a black holes

125
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,659
and we'd all this work to a control

126
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,388
collateral damage but in case this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

127
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,300
very long time the other thing that you

128
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:39,820
add to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is once the attack has been</font>

129
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,710
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you've black</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> folder and</font>

130
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you sent the community strings up to</font>

131
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,370
your service<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider the only way you</font>

132
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:51,340
really know whether the attack has done

133
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:53,530
is to undo this and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you get so</font>

134
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,729
our happy little school system grows and

135
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,619
we decide that we've got to do something

136
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,599
and we've got to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it bigger and so</font>

137
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,550
that's what usually happens at the

138
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,770
single location they go we need to be

139
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to do some type of mitigation and</font>

140
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,669
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see this that now you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

141
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">build the transportation systems up in</font>

142
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to be able to get all the traffic</font>

143
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,500
in you're still doing a sinkhole that's

144
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,490
the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all in</font>

145
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,960
excuse me so the transportation systems

146
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,729
must have grow the sewage systems have

147
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow in that same area so all the</font>

148
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:25,020
resources all around have to grow in

149
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,020
order just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support this thing</font>

150
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,740
excellent so we're basically talking

151
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,770
about deploying a mitigation server or a

152
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,169
scrubbing hardware that allows you to

153
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,139
route traffic through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and ascend</font>

154
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:39,940
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proper destination but just</font>

155
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,380
like the single<font color="#E5E5E5"> schoolhouse you've got</font>

156
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,849
all the infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have to</font>

157
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,280
get the traffic there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet the</font>

158
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,759
traffic back the nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about being</font>

159
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">a DDoS attack or not that I'm one but</font>

160
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,530
that I only have to be right<font color="#E5E5E5"> once and</font>

161
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,849
you have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right every time I just</font>

162
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,330
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the weakest link if the</font>

163
00:07:54,849 --> 00:08:00,070
weakest link is all of your transit and

164
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,510
I overrun that you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go home it</font>

165
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,840
doesn't matter all I have to do is

166
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,880
launch

167
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,349
same attack if it's the fact that your

168
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,330
router's can't keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packets</font>

169
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,800
per second that I'm sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care</font>

170
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you've got this great mitigation</font>

171
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,790
box you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to upgrade everything in</font>

172
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:17,530
order to be able to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I only</font>

173
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:19,840
need to be right<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yeah and what we</font>

174
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,849
found is basically the scrubbing center

175
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,900
of the mitigation server works great if

176
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,880
you put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of a small</font>

177
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:31,599
environment and you're dealing with

178
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:33,479
small attacks the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pros is the mitigation</font>

179
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,029
server is completely in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

180
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,680
that's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing it has</font>

181
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:43,980
flexibility so you can deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

182
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:46,449
tuning you know it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> self identifying</font>

183
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,640
properties inside of it which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

184
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,670
nobody from the outside has to have that

185
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,470
set access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your network to see if an</font>

186
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,150
attack is occurring because it's all

187
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,890
done within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box self and that makes</font>

188
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:03,040
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

189
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,319
disadvantages basically you it's very

190
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive you have to keep adding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

191
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,380
and more boxes and there's some of the

192
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,430
hardware that's available out there has

193
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,140
packets per second limitations also you

194
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,500
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internal expertise now</font>

195
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,480
the B dose is all in your hand I don't

196
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">think many of us here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as service</font>

197
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,070
providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> our main businesses</font>

198
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,569
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> d dots I think our main</font>

199
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,330
business is doing other things that

200
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,690
produce revenue and not just buying to

201
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,370
hang on to it so having<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal</font>

202
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,200
expertise and spending money here is

203
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,240
money that we could spend somewhere else

204
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,610
for different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of personnel who</font>

205
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,110
could produce more revenue than just

206
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,720
keeping what's happening with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deed</font>

207
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,140
awesome the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is</font>

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,430
remember this still increases our op<font color="#E5E5E5"> x</font>

209
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,140
because i<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have to build that</font>

210
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,790
infrastructure and increase it in size

211
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,069
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with all the</font>

212
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,740
traffic that's coming in so this in a

213
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,220
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> by itself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just didn't get it</font>

214
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">formed so what the school system does</font>

215
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,500
for this is they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> county style</font>

216
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,209
model so that each county ends up

217
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,370
building their own school system and

218
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,500
they all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own little buildings</font>

219
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,459
but now the transportation system

220
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,040
doesn't have to

221
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:21,459
so they do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us cost savings</font>

222
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,959
benefit however<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens is now they</font>

223
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,160
have to have administrative staff and

224
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,839
they have to keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all the</font>

225
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,730
buildings<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're putting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

226
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,990
and all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different pieces some of</font>

227
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,790
these same properties that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

228
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,759
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to overcome from a cost they just</font>

229
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,219
moved around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what you find</font>

230
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,110
happening with<font color="#CCCCCC"> D dost as well yes and we</font>

231
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,550
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up adding more and more of</font>

232
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,529
those mitigation servers across the

233
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,099
network and usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is more</font>

234
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:47,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware means more management and more</font>

235
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,730
personnel more tools that you have to

236
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:51,128
deploy in order to deal with it those

237
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,720
different types of things and so the the

238
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:54,699
benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this is you've pushed it out</font>

239
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,470
and now the core of your backbone

240
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,149
doesn't necessarily have to grow because

241
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,860
you're catching it closer to the edges

242
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,839
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it still doesn't</font>

243
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,029
overcome the fact that you've got to

244
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,860
upbraid everything coming in to get to

245
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,660
the mitigation servers and each of those

246
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,220
mitigation service has to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

247
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,219
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the amount of traffic that it</font>

248
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,860
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing is often</font>

249
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,019
they're not tied together which means

250
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,550
that are all acting independently so the

251
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:21,189
intelligence either has to be built by

252
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:24,998
you or it has to be performed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by you if</font>

253
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:28,839
you're that intelligent so what do we do

254
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:30,459
with our kids we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't keep up</font>

255
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the educational little Johnny needs</font>

256
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to send this little but to</font>

257
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,819
college and so we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somebody</font>

258
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,709
else can deal with the situation they

259
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:41,049
can scale their infrastructure and that

260
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:44,920
they can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expertise that I need</font>

261
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:49,319
in order to educate a little Johnny so

262
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,699
we send them off and much<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

263
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:53,229
outsourcing education what you can do is

264
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,959
partner with a cloud DDoS mitigation

265
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,389
provider the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is basically</font>

266
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:01,449
all the DDoS attacks coming through the

267
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:04,629
provider and clean traffic comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

268
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:06,219
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do have to deal with the GRE</font>

269
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:07,990
tunnels and all the other stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

270
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">were just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about so none of that</font>

271
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,249
is true yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> setup</font>

272
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,589
is you bring up a GRE tunnel you

273
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:18,220
establish a BGP session and you

274
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:21,040
advertise a minimum of / 24 to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

275
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">das cloudy das mitigation provider it'll</font>

276
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,998
be interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

277
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,850
do with ipv6 and what they do you know

278
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:29,260
decide on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that limited amount is that</font>

279
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,330
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce up there</font>

280
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,310
as well in order to pull traffic over

281
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you pull traffic into the</font>

282
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">ddos provider and you put it back yes</font>

283
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:42,190
and some of the concerns that come up is

284
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,590
MTU and also the increased inbound

285
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,780
latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the outbound traffic go</font>

286
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,420
directly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the pros are</font>

287
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,150
that your mitigation service carries the

288
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,490
growth problem so you've got this

289
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:57,400
network and you're putting money into it

290
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,460
now if I'm growing my customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> base I'm</font>

291
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my network but if</font>

292
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,750
I'm spending all this money<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

293
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,939
have some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack me</font>

294
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,950
once a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that I'm</font>

295
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,870
not really happy with that spin I would

296
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,550
rather put that in the new cloud I'd

297
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,780
rather put that into new locations I

298
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,449
would rather put that somewhere else

299
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it produces something for me so</font>

300
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a mitigation provider that I'm</font>

301
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,680
utilizing have to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of his</font>

302
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,770
resources on something that's his

303
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,229
expertise I'm happier with because I get

304
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,640
to use my resources somewhere else they

305
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,950
also have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the personnel</font>

306
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,390
issue the 24-7 it's not my guys that

307
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,880
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on all this they're guys that</font>

308
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,770
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on all and keep that level of</font>

309
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,420
expertise and this usually gets

310
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,069
appointed two different methods one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

311
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,260
the easiest methods is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there always on</font>

312
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,520
method and it has some cons of come with

313
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,060
it we'll talk about that in just a

314
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,850
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the as needed and it has some</font>

315
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,579
other complications in fact a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

316
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:58,720
times cloud providers actually want some

317
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:01,540
type of access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your routers which I</font>

318
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,220
have never allowed because I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

319
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,089
do you need access to my routers well

320
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,820
because i need to do SNMP rights I need

321
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,670
to do SNMP read I need your flow data

322
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,680
some way or another I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite that</font>

323
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:18,540
comfortable I mean I'm I trust people

324
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:20,530
pretty much but I don't trust them that

325
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,030
accident some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these advantages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

326
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,130
already covered basically the increased

00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,230
latency having to go through the cloud

330
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,250
performance over the internet and one

331
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,100
thing to note is there always down

332
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,600
configuration when you route that / 24

333
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,550
over the internet you can stuck with

334
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,050
those IP addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that means</font>

335
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,089
is that I've got a customer under attack

336
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,680
if it's an always-on situational

337
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,269
I understand you're under attack mr.

338
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,099
customer so what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do is</font>

339
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:49,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch over to these IP addresses and</font>

340
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,180
you need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to go change your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dns oh I'm sorry you set it for 72 hours</font>

342
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,160
before it changes I'd really<font color="#CCCCCC"> love to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

343
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,699
able to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but I can't help you</font>

344
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,819
that easily what the school system has

345
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:05,709
done about these types of things is

346
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,660
they've basically come up with a hybrid

347
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,998
<font color="#CCCCCC">approach and you see that with a lot of</font>

348
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,860
the college's they have the expertise at

349
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:14,230
a certain location and it's centralized

350
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,540
and they scale that location but then

351
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,730
they have satellites and the satellites

352
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,370
have video conferencing that sometimes

353
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,959
they have teachers that are there you

354
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,029
know there's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> school systems</font>

355
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,109
that have excelled at that and some of

356
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:30,730
them that only work this way and that's

357
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,180
worked very well for the school system

358
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as we looked at that we thought boy</font>

359
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,930
there are things that I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

360
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,439
about both approaches and there's things

361
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:46,120
that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like about both approaches</font>

362
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:48,009
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so one of the</font>

363
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,040
art where attributes that we liked is

364
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:52,839
you had control it was local<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

365
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,879
mitigation didn't have to necessarily go

366
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,370
somewhere I'll kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that if it's</font>

367
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,860
not big why send it up why go run to

368
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,600
somebody else to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it happen the</font>

369
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,160
other is it had the self identifying

370
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,920
traffic monitoring they didn't need

371
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,889
access to my routers they kind of were

372
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,240
standalone I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that they</font>

373
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:13,749
could be integrated with my local tools

374
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,519
because I knew what was going on the

375
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:18,429
other thing that the cloud had though

376
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,929
that I really liked was I didn't carry

377
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:23,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the burden of scale just because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

378
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:26,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">toss the other thing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liked was they</font>

379
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:28,239
had to have the expertise I had to have

380
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:31,540
a general awareness of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

381
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,529
function I just wanted some<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to see</font>

382
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,990
it the mitigation servers also had to

383
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment I like that I</font>

384
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,129
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware support they</font>

385
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:45,490
had the hardware support that they have

386
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:48,759
to deal with and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> my transit</font>

387
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs didn't increase greatly just</font>

388
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,799
because someone may attack me in the

389
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,800
future so i need to quadruple what my

390
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,649
capacity is coming in or revenue

391
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,540
that I wasn't currently getting he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

392
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,880
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> attribute to avoid large capital</font>

393
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,099
investment for a medium-sized network

394
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,130
we're looking at several million dollars

395
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:10,809
on top of that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ALP X the</font>

396
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">headcount the additional transit</font>

397
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:15,609
capacity and most importantly having to

398
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,379
deal with scaling the network I know

399
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:19,329
your management teams may not realize

400
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,949
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think you do when you add</font>

401
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,698
equipment you kind of end up having to

402
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,679
add people or two or technology one of

403
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,600
the two but there's an additional spin

404
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that always comes with you equip it's</font>

405
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:36,250
not magic it doesn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen for you</font>

406
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,170
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted a hybrid of both we wanted</font>

407
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,570
the local we wanted the cloud we kind of

408
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,940
knew what we were looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

409
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,620
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this so we ended up</font>

410
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,970
working looking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure</font>

411
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">out what it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't like that</font>

412
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">latency thing with the cloud so one of</font>

413
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,010
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me is a</font>

414
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:56,890
provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did any cast however any</font>

415
00:17:54,010 --> 00:18:00,010
cast if it's acting independently is any

416
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:02,320
mess so I needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all to pull back to</font>

417
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:05,230
a single eyes database of some pipe so

418
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,418
that the decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was made was</font>

419
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,460
actually a holistic decision and not

420
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,710
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> or five independent decisions that</font>

421
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,370
occur on whether something should occur

422
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:18,250
or not the other thing is is I needed

423
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to have the flexibility of not</font>

424
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,260
being bound by someone else's equipment

425
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,550
if they were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service and someone</font>

426
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,610
else's equipment then they were kind of

427
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,168
bound by that so the first the company

428
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I picked as I actually pick stamina</font>

429
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:32,050
scommn eunuch ations because they had

430
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,459
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over their own</font>

431
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:39,309
system they wrote their own software

432
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,440
they wrote their own mitigation software

433
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:42,910
so the clay out all these other pieces I

434
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,570
knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could tie those together</font>

435
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's what we ended up doing and</font>

436
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,340
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expand on this drawing earlier</font>

437
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,590
basically we're expanding the cloud

438
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,780
capabilities into the into the network

439
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,020
by in deploying those mitigation and

440
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,460
monitoring servers and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned the</font>

441
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,220
centralized database this is only

442
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,750
possible by allowing those monitoring

443
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,520
mitigation servers deployed in your

444
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,090
network to talk to back to the cloud and

445
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,620
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you noticed</font>

446
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,039
back on the drawing is basically talking

447
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,969
to your sinkhole controller which

448
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,330
basically talks to the rest of the

449
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,250
network the Cinco controller is the one

450
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,730
of my references to that is that is the

451
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:24,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Spock method of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS management the</font>

452
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,630
needs of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the many outweigh the needs of</font>

453
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the few or the one so if the one gets</font>

454
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,640
attacked you kill it that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spock</font>

455
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,980
method for doing it a lot of customers

456
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are the one they're not extremely</font>

457
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,789
pleased<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that so mitigation and</font>

458
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,168
being able to mitigate its pretty

459
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:42,140
important when you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

460
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing however that satellite models</font>

461
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,029
really what you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what I wanted I</font>

462
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,740
didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal with all</font>

463
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:50,960
that hardware I want to somebody else to

464
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,789
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted it in my network to</font>

465
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,770
be able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

466
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:58,279
approaches that you may end up using and

467
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,049
it still uses bgp and one thing to note

468
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,159
is basically the result that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mt you</font>

469
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,679
should we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> geo</font>

470
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">eternal earlier is you use a carrier</font>

471
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,809
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise provides a connection with</font>

472
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,789
jumbo frames so that way you don't have

473
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:14,059
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about you know fragmentation or</font>

474
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:16,190
any of that and this is the example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

475
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:19,129
how i deploy monitoring server you have

476
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,260
provider or<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry p 1 and p or two but</font>

477
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,720
they connect both<font color="#CCCCCC"> to there's a passive</font>

478
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">fiber-optic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taps duplicating every</font>

479
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,140
packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's coming into your network</font>

480
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what the monitoring server does is</font>

481
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,919
basically monitors every<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

482
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:36,049
incoming traffic and also communicates

483
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,960
to the cloud and to your sink hole

484
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:40,399
controller and along these lines

485
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,100
remember this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cost control method</font>

486
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:44,510
if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlimited resources put a</font>

487
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,149
mitigation box on each one of those

488
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,279
lines it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this was just a matter</font>

489
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:51,860
of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would go about doing this in</font>

490
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the least expensive way that you could</font>

491
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,469
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with d das issues yes</font>

492
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the example of deploying to</font>

493
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,480
mitigation server is basically asked

494
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,820
like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDP s system you have dirty</font>

495
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,559
traffic on one interface then you drop

496
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,580
the attack traffic and the clean traffic

497
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,580
goes out on another interface

498
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">what an attack becomes this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably</font>

499
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:19,549
the best part when in tax becomes too

500
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:22,940
big we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the swing to cloud or</font>

501
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,860
dents in the cloud and what happens here

502
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">is I'll give you an example let's say an</font>

503
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,570
aggregate is fashioned to advertise on

504
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:32,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet you get an attack to an IP</font>

505
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,908
address what it does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system does it</font>

506
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:36,649
automatically routes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stash 24 only</font>

507
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:38,840
through the cloud DDoS mitigation

508
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:41,149
provider which forces all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic to</font>

509
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,820
go through the cloud in that set up by

510
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:45,678
profiles to be able to say if it's up to

511
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,360
this profile let's say it's up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

512
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,159
gigs you go five gigs for local

513
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,990
mitigation I'm fine with that i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

514
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,059
can deal with that so if it's up to five

515
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,250
gigs then that's good and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can deal</font>

516
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:56,840
with it don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do anything however if it</font>

517
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,279
exceeds five gigs then I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

518
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,379
swing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all that needs to be</font>

519
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,960
automated what do I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know I need</font>

520
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:06,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that I something was identified</font>

521
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,789
and then an action was taken and so we

522
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,200
do that as we start to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

523
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,049
need some type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> management and</font>

524
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,690
alerting capabilities of the profiles of

525
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:19,759
the alerts that would tell me could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

526
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">an email it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an API call it</font>

527
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,399
could be any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things that says</font>

528
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:27,080
hey this IP address was attacked then

529
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:29,239
you can do whatever magic do you want on

530
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,129
your in to say well who's the customer

531
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,570
associated with that ikea dressed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

532
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:37,129
should contact that and let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

533
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:38,450
all is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good on the home front yes</font>

534
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:40,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people forget is</font>

535
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,019
basically integration with your internal

536
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,279
systems I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great to great to</font>

537
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:45,409
partner with somebody but you know

538
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,299
everything has to work and to end so

539
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:48,860
that communication with ticketing system

540
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">alerting system everything has to be in</font>

541
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,309
place and nowadays api's are very

542
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:54,200
popular so make sure you you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

543
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:56,149
your partner<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you need visibility</font>

544
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,710
without visibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're still</font>

545
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:59,418
you don't know whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really a</font>

546
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">ddos or whether they've done the deed</font>

547
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:05,899
off by taking out your service so

548
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">school's out for now and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glad what</font>

549
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:09,590
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody do after school get beer</font>

550
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,899
so I'm sure you're happy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

551
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,418
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means by now is education is</font>

552
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:16,610
never done if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe me ask</font>

553
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:23,080
your significant other if you need to

554
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:26,139
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> more DDoS mitigation is at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

555
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,270
this isn't the final it will continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

556
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,850
grow it will continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change and I'll</font>

557
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,280
look forward to that anything you want

558
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,719
to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you any questions we're</font>

564
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:55,179
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to say a story on the</font>

00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:13,240
it's actually come to the effort so they

571
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:16,240
set up an entity with<font color="#CCCCCC"> lies I responsible</font>

572
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">for getting all the hardware for ddos</font>

573
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,860
mitigation they put it up connect to the

574
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,620
absurd emit an exchange platform and

575
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,620
from there dr. provider can use the

576
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,929
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so absolutely yeah to be</font>

577
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,909
honest that's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than a cloud</font>

578
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,590
provider the cloud just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to be</font>

579
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,420
there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cross connect as opposed</font>

580
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,220
to over a tunnel or over a dedicated

581
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,840
circuit the difference we're talking

582
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,550
about two things the length<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

583
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,199
tunnel I assume they have somebody

584
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,330
running that and that everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

585
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,240
have independent run of it which means

586
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it is its own d das</font>

587
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,970
provider absolutely makes tons of sense

588
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,350
it's the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did with the</font>

589
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,760
school system by pulling all the

590
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,000
resources and going we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send our</font>

591
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">kids somewhere together yeah because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

592
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,660
already have the platform of Amsterdam

593
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,460
eternity n over there so just like put

594
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:05,800
up the surfaces everybody can connect to

595
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:07,180
it and say it grow by demand so if more

596
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,149
members I mean they have more resources

597
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,100
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like buying a parade hardware</font>

598
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,550
buying more powerful boxes Buddha

599
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,230
mitigation so I furnaces personally I

600
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,600
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good example or come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

601
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,020
effort for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yep its own it's always</font>

602
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">only money exactly yeah this is a great</font>

603
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,650
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that a lot of</font>

604
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">some organizations that have the volume</font>

605
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,140
of the scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's what have done</font>

606
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,510
they've actually come up with their own

607
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,370
scrubbing centers they just buy a bunch

608
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,990
of thinking circuits and put the

609
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,459
hardware in and the beauty about that

610
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">setup is that actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very easy to</font>

611
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,840
make it work

612
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:42,760
with your internal mitigation services

613
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,949
basically having that communication is

614
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,379
very important so that you can swing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

615
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,820
traffic again in case you know it's too

616
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,410
big well the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice</font>

617
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,939
by doing that my cross connect is there

618
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,520
is no GRE tunnels therefore there are no

619
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,040
MTU issues to deal with basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

620
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,070
cross<font color="#E5E5E5"> connects and that's that's nice if</font>

621
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,480
it's facilitated with you yep I will

622
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,669
still don't have jumbo frame on the

623
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:11,530
platform yourself yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'ma make an</font>

624
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:14,730
assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well thanks guys</font>

625
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,730
appreciate thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

626
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,860
you
