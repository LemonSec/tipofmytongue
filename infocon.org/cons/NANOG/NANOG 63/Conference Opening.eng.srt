I guess we think we're better than

207
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,770

208
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,470

434
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:55,150
the past to pull these meetings off it's

435
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,920
really important thanks Josh so I

436
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:00,699
thought what I would do is change a bit

437
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,990
of my update or my my announcements to

438
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,600
all of you at the start of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meeting</font>

439
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:09,280
by giving you sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an update about</font>

440
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:11,500
what's happening at<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog and the first</font>

441
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is of course a few important</font>

442
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,230
statements you'll see some improvement

443
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">in our signage and changes in terms of</font>

444
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,400
our relationship and presentation I just

445
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,800
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call out the differences and</font>

446
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,080
that the premium sponsors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

447
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,220
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your key card sleeves when you</font>

448
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,230
checked in and on our signage and and

449
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:36,250
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in our relationship with nanog</font>

450
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:40,480
is critically important those sponsors

451
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:44,170
that are our diamond and platinum and

452
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,690
gold sponsors help me deliver services

453
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,940
to all of you they actually pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all</font>

454
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,000
the additional overhead that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows</font>

455
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,580
nanog to grow and do additional services

456
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,610
so it keeps your registration<font color="#CCCCCC"> feed down</font>

457
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,620
and it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to grow so please</font>

458
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,580
please join me in thanking all of them

459
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">for their continued support</font>

460
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual meeting sponsors are also</font>

461
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,100
very important and for the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

462
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,930
have 60 of them so from the days when i

463
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,230
first started<font color="#CCCCCC"> at nanog when we had maybe</font>

464
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:22,050
four to say that we have 60 sponsors

465
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that the return</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and investment</font>

466
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:28,409
in engaging in the limited way in which

467
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:31,290
we do sponsorship is a true tribute to

468
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:35,820
them as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well their contribution also</font>

469
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:38,070
allows us to add a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tuesday lunch free of</font>

charge<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of you first time ever</font>

471
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,050
that nanog now only not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

472
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,899
breakfast every day a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday lunch</font>

473
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,659

478
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,840
important to our future is the

479
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,000
difference between an anode conference

480
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,500
that we host three times a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font>

481
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,150
thing that you'll hear about called

482
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,560
nanog on the road we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in in</font>

483
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,890
increasing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of nanog on the</font>

484
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:19,379
road one day events again<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the</font>

nanog meeting in a one day experience so

494
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,510
we're growing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet we're</font>

495
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,640
distributing and sharing greater

information about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

497
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,330
operates globally so nanog on the road

498
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:57,000
one day think of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> anon meeting and</font>

499
00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:00,090
think of it in orlando in a couple

500
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,430
months and speakers there so it really

501
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,129
works because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can count out all of you</font>

532
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,920
on meeting online it's really really

533
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,150
easy and we support their attendance

534
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,610
here they have to fill out a little

535
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,580
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a selection</font>

536
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:38,790
committee so there is a review process

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know send me a note</font>

539
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:48,570
fellowship program is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really our attempt</font>

540
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:50,399
to facilitate and make it easier for

541
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,290
folks who want to be a part of the

542
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,930
community but<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the resources</font>

543
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:59,310
to attend so if you know anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

544
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:01,380
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at your university or in the</font>

545
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,810
the government arena that could benefit

546
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,000
from attending an anion meaning send in

547
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,820
my way we have fellowships that are

548
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,160
being unused that we would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

549
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:16,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to offer to those deserving the</font>

550
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,050
membership versus attendee it's my way

551
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,630
of reminding everyone that both are

552
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:24,270
important there are a number of folks in

553
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">our community that our attendees or on</font>

554
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:30,510
the nanog mailing list that make up<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana</font>

555
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,419
they're really important but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i encourage</font>

556
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of you to also consider becoming a</font>

557
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:43,230
member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana the benefits of</font>

558
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:46,380
membership are it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy and</font>

559
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,510
yet it's it's one of those important

560
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,690
elements on your resume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is</font>

561
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:54,780
important because you help determine who

562
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:58,230
serves on the board of directors and you

563
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:01,410
help guide this thing called nana if you

564
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:04,800
remember so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know more</font>

565
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,960
about what a hundred dollars will buy

611
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,650
about was specifically the college

part of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> community for a long time</font>

618
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,970
now the students that we have here part

619
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,880
of both the telecommunications and Comp

620
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:25,990
Sci programs so you know relatively

621
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,900
broad a brush of potential experience

622
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:32,470
coming in it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 I had actually</font>

623
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,180
talked about this last October and said

624
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,100
I wanted way more and we do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

625
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,320
more this is just the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> test to see</font>

626
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,590
how it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking of tests these</font>

627
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,419
students are here to absorb the program

628
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,600
and obviously absorb the networking

629
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,700
piece of of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall program not just</font>

630
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,260
what goes on here in the plenary but

631
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,980
their instructors are primarily

632
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,590
responsible for if you upgrading what

633
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,660
the result is here so us on the nanog

634
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,399
board and the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the namek staff</font>

635
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,500
are not necessarily driving a curriculum

636
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,570
out of this we feel that the best

637
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,080
engagement can come from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

638
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">are better equipped in higher education</font>

639
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I hope that by the June meeting will be</font>

640
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,149
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand this to 20 students</font>

641
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:19,480
potentially from multiple colleges we

642
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,900
picked UC Boulder because of Kevin's

643
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:27,280
experience but we're really excited so

644
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:30,670
the students are identified with an

645
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,620
orange dot on their bad and so if one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

646
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:35,410
them should come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you you should</font>

00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,760
they're engaged in and what they're

653
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,010
learning about the best thing that we

654
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,980
can do as a community is provide a

655
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,920
conduit so that when we all move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>
