00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:14,500
it's good hi I'm Alex plant and the

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,240
product manager<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the ripe NCC of the</font>

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,300
mic isn't working<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the mic isn't</font>

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:24,329
working let's take a look this is it

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:31,599
switched on huh is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that better</font>

6
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:33,430
yes oh there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well like i said</font>

7
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,800
i'm alex band and the product manager<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:39,550
ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ncc over the last four years we</font>

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,190
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on a production rpki</font>

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,849
system and over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> course of time we</font>

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned quite some things which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,190
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you</font>

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about over the next half hour ultra</font>

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,449
quick intro for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,460
know what rpki is essentially in this

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,530
system the regional internet registries

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,340
they become a certificate authority they

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,619
have a self-signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> x509certificate that</font>

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,770
has all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the resources that the</font>

20
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:14,830
regional internet registry manages and

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:18,158
from that lar so I speech they can

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:20,110
request a certificate containing their

23
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,820
internet number resources this

24
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,789
certificate can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then subsequently be</font>

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,158
used to make statements about your

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,080
resources and that statement can really

27
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,950
be anything but the implementation that

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've done is to use this for bgp origin</font>

29
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,090
validation so essentially you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make a</font>

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,110
statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what is allowed with</font>

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:44,560
regards to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and with your IP</font>

32
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:47,380
addresses and this statement is called a

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">route origin authorization and a route</font>

34
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,320
origin authorization essentially says i

35
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,949
authorize this autonomous system to

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,570
originate these of my IP addresses and

37
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route object</font>

38
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:05,710
does in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRR aroma has one additional</font>

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,590
data point and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maximum</font>

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,760
prefix length and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially says</font>

41
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:15,489
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorize this a s2d aggregate this</font>

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,709
prefix up until this point if they

43
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,100
announced it any more specific then it's

44
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">not authorized</font>

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,210
they put all of these statements

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,160
together in one big repository and then

47
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,660
any operator anywhere in the world can

48
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,890
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these statements and</font>

49
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,140
start comparing them to realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP and</font>

50
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,470
well if you see bgp announcement and it

51
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,019
has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> roller that covers it then that</font>

52
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,540
makes them happy and if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a BGP</font>

53
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,310
announcement and the robots as well it's

54
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,040
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be coming from that is</font>

55
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,840
or it is too specific and that is

56
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,600
unauthorized then that makes the

57
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,850
operator unhappy and basically on those

58
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,450
two things you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make decisions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

59
00:02:52,850 --> 00:03:00,380
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make whatever decision you like</font>

60
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:02,359
now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what it does then you go but</font>

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,799
don't we already have a system for that

62
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,090
don't we have the Internet routing

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,400
registry like the rdb and the ripe

64
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,760
database is also an irr and in fact

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,940
there are 34<font color="#CCCCCC"> irrs in the world but the</font>

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,709
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that they're not all that</font>

67
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">reliable I mean the ripe database for</font>

68
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:24,740
example in employees security you need

69
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to authenticate against the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> island numb</font>

70
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,360
objects in the database in order for you

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,460
to actually create a route object but if

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all of those 34 I are ours</font>

73
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,100
together they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that level of</font>

74
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:39,410
authentication and also data quality in

75
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,010
there are ours is maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that bad</font>

76
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,270
so once you start asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> operators well</font>

77
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,100
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reliable way to</font>

78
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:52,490
tell if a route announcement is supposed

79
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,290
to be out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes or no if you really</font>

80
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:59,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">bring it down to the basis and you leave</font>

81
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:01,609
aside all knowledge of how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

82
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up to now work and</font>

83
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,560
the current reality of it if you really

84
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,230
ask that question the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of them go oh</font>

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,590
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love to have that</font>

86
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">information I would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know of the</font>

87
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">500,000 route announcements that are out</font>

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,608
there but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is supposed to be out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

89
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,400
yes or no so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that premise on that</font>

90
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:24,409
basis we started building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a system to</font>

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,630
answer that question in a reliable way

92
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is also the added value that we</font>

93
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,729
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give over the Internet routing</font>

94
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,469
registry system to make it valid a table

95
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,810
to make

96
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,060
reliable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an accurate and</font>

97
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,600
complete data set that is the goal here

98
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,430
that is what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so the right</font>

99
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,140
entities actually started working on

100
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,730
this in 2006 we made like little

101
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,969
prototypes and you try two different

102
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,190
things and we launched an open beta

103
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,720
somewhere in mid-2010 to work with

104
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,910
operators to get some operational

105
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,400
feedback to see how do we use such a

106
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:03,130
system and what their needs are and how

107
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,650
we would need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> set it up and then on</font>

108
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,630
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of January 2011 all of the</font>

109
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,270
five rars committed to having an

110
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,980
operational service now and especially

111
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:16,599
in the ripe NCC that was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

112
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:19,690
complicated because not everybody not

113
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,300
all address space is the same we have

114
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,520
these weird stuff with flavors of IP

115
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,190
addresses we have so-called provider

116
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">aggregate able but we also have provider</font>

117
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,380
independent space and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's all</font>

118
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,300
that legacy space and their<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called</font>

119
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,480
minority space where the majority are

120
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,820
you are so the / 8 block where it comes

121
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,620
out of actually is lying within a

122
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,150
different regional internet registry

123
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,320
they were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh man if we're going to</font>

124
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">tackle all of that on the get-go we're</font>

125
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,550
never going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working so</font>

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,150
we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to only do member space</font>

127
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,490
regular provider aggregate<font color="#E5E5E5"> ville space</font>

128
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,950
and then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you start</font>

129
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,040
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about certificate authorities</font>

130
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:06,430
then in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world everybody would</font>

131
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,740
run their own CA you would generate your

132
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,440
own private and public key pair and you

133
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,240
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it signed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the root</font>

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,580
certificate authority in this case the

135
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,970
ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCC so everybody would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

136
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,370
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for running their own CA and</font>

137
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:23,440
for their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own publication etc etc that</font>

138
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,510
is how the system is designed because

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,469
any security experts will tell you well

140
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,960
if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

141
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,760
certificate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 related do you</font>

142
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,349
better be the holder of your own private

143
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:39,669
key right but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was a product</font>

144
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:41,470
manager I gave training courses I did

145
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:44,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">training courses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the ripe NCC and</font>

146
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,820
one of them was DNS SEC training courses

147
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:50,200
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was in a time that none of the</font>

148
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:52,030
feel these were signed and I would try

149
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,810
to teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> people without any of the</font>

150
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:58,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">available tools to do a key role over</font>

151
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,570
for example to set up their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own little</font>

152
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,970
secure dns heck island by the time you

153
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:06,909
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to step 12 wait for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time-to-live</font>

154
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,470
to pass and then move on to step 13 and

155
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,800
then talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your zone signing key</font>

156
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,620
they were like really really I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

157
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,400
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this just the setup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my own little</font>

158
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:21,270
secured in a sec island and if I mess it

159
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,060
up i make my entire zone and available

160
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">why would I put in all of that effort</font>

161
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,160
because the return on investment

162
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,900
arguably is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

163
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,140
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what let's set up a hosted</font>

164
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,690
system and that's a security trade-off

165
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,240
we're essentially you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

166
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,310
can request a certificate with your

167
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,380
resources on it but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

168
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,930
it on a hardware security module that

169
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,360
resides within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ripe NCC data center</font>

170
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,750
if you trust us to do to run such<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

171
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,360
service for you then please<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and</font>

172
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,150
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel free and request a</font>

173
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,360
certificate and we'll set up a pilot

174
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,039
system that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to if in case</font>

175
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,170
you want to run your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own certificate</font>

176
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,440
authority and we were like okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

177
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:10,020
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> see where this goes because we made</font>

178
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,580
a conscious decision to keep it simple

179
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">we needed to gain operational experience</font>

180
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,800
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we had no experience</font>

181
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,810
running a certificate authority and we

182
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,810
wanted to get our user feedback as much

183
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,300
as possible and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then within the hosted</font>

184
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:28,600
system we try to automate all of the

185
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:32,669
Crito complexity take away the worry of

186
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,870
key rollovers etc etc etc because

187
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,360
ultimately if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask people</font>

188
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want a reliable system where you</font>

189
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">can make statements about your routing</font>

190
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,849
and they have to worry about setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

191
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,340
their own CA and they have to worry

192
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing their own key rollovers what</font>

193
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,450
are they getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in return especially if</font>

194
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,849
you're an early adopter you've hitting

195
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,340
in all that effort you're getting

196
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,710
nothing in return so we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid</font>

197
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">making people jump through burning hoops</font>

198
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,810
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that or you completely</font>

199
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">to made it all of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signing setting up</font>

200
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:09,079
the certificate resource changes for

201
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,000
example so if you got new resources from

202
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rer they would be automatically</font>

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,990
added to your certificate in a new

204
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,820
updated one would be published if you

205
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,070
return resources or if you transfer

206
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,620
resources a new updated certificate

207
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,920
would automatically be generative and be

208
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,900
published we were like if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

209
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">take care of all of the crypto we don't</font>

210
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to show it in the interface</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

211
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those hashes and si a</font>

212
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:36,020
pointer zand AAA pointers that we don't

213
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,089
need any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that the only thing that a</font>

214
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,750
user really needs to worry about is

215
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:44,960
setting up<font color="#CCCCCC"> their rowers making sure that</font>

216
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,480
what they publish actually matches their

217
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,620
intended bgp configuration there was a

218
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:54,500
goal well if you bring it back to what a

219
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,660
rower really is this a s is authorized

220
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,820
to originate these are my prefixes and

221
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,310
this is how much they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be a great it</font>

222
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,770
you could bring it down to three input

223
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:08,930
fields in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the submit button a s number</font>

224
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:12,470
prefix max length submit should be easy

225
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,660
enough and we were like yeah well maybe

226
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe you</font>

227
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,520
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it a little bit user friendly</font>

228
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,490
so this was our first stab this is the

229
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,040
first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we came up with see if</font>

230
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,400
it works now we get to the tricky bit

231
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,260
with animation there we go this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

232
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first thing we did like a</font>

233
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,670
drag-and-drop interface and it was 2011

234
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,850
and I tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I was really proud</font>

235
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,010
because I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was really fancy</font>

236
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:42,890
and and this was a typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of form</font>

237
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,520
over function we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

238
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,620
overboard with this is so easy look so

239
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,170
this is what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could fill it</font>

240
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,570
in a s number and then you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

241
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,610
a very descriptive name and then you

242
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,710
could drag one of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources in</font>

243
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,170
there and click it and edit it in an

244
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,060
interim maximum prefix length and we

245
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,099
also have validity times that you could

246
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,869
set and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> even supports v6 and</font>

247
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,560
everything you're like wow that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

248
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,600
this is awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will use this and</font>

249
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,170
love this because it's intuitive and

250
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font>

251
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:20,250
and now well people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interested</font>

252
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,839
because we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and and I</font>

253
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,610
remember having a conversation with the

254
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,930
lead developer because in this pilot

255
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,879
system we had 90 cas we had 90 la ours

256
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,729
who said I want to try this out because

257
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,290
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like fun and it was like okay</font>

258
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,720
on the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of January when we're going</font>

259
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to production we're gonna throw</font>

260
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,459
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out and they were going to</font>

261
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,939
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a clean slate was like no</font>

262
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:47,489
we'll never get those 90 back it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

263
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:51,899
years because i was expecting sort of an

264
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:55,319
adoption like ipv6 and DNS SEC sort of

265
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:59,310
slow especially as a brand new

266
00:11:55,319 --> 00:12:01,139
technology but but now we had like 226

267
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,060
certificates in the first month so yay

268
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:05,220
and that's because it was really easy

269
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just have to click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there yeah sure</font>

270
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,959
give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certificate button and then</font>

271
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:12,269
you set up a CA and we took care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

272
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,369
everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then people were like</font>

273
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,559
where's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> pie address space where's my</font>

274
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,569
minority space where is my ear x space

275
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,459
so people actually apparently cared

276
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:22,500
about all of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we weren't</font>

277
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:26,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing those like okay there's interest</font>

278
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,829
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want this surprisingly but almost</font>

279
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,389
nobody created rowers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think when</font>

280
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,599
you saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> animation that I showed you</font>

281
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:38,100
earlier you can see why it before like

282
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,459
what what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and you know I am</font>

283
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:45,120
I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this affect any of my</font>

284
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,979
bgp because if it affects my bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

285
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,699
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch it I need to be sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

286
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:53,730
this is reliable so nobody created rose

287
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:57,378
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ones that did they are</font>

288
00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:01,410
really really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at making bad rowers</font>

289
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:03,750
because if you create a rower you can

290
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,449
make one of your bgp announcements valid

291
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,939
but you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sure that once you</font>

292
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:11,069
start creating them you create them from

293
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:13,019
all of the announcements that you do all

294
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:15,479
of them so all of your customer

295
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:18,029
announcements as well because if you

296
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,860
don't then they will all be flagged as

297
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:22,500
an authorized it will be flagged as a

298
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,529
hijack but people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like in a lot i</font>

299
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,199
just created one for my AG<font color="#CCCCCC"> raquet for my</font>

300
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:31,800
oh yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's pretty good as a start</font>

301
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:33,870
and they didn't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

302
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,998
<font color="#E5E5E5">created one valence and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the process</font>

303
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:41,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">they created 50 customer invalids and</font>

304
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:43,709
that isn't right and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

305
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:46,379
interface didn't show any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that so we</font>

306
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:48,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">had awful awful data quality there were</font>

307
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,730
more invalid in the system than<font color="#CCCCCC"> valance</font>

308
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:54,360
it was like if any operator is going to

309
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,309
be interested in using this yeah you

310
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,809
sort of go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the initial idea of</font>

311
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:02,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR system we're awful data quality</font>

312
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:05,040
is the thing that you were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

313
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">combat you wanted to make something more</font>

314
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,879
reliable not something that has a bunch

315
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:14,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">of crap data so what did people do wrong</font>

316
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,910
mostly it's that maximum length thing

317
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:20,370
because in the standards it said if you

318
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:24,809
leave the maximum field a maximum length

319
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:27,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">field blank then it is as strict as</font>

320
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:29,370
possible so if you have a / 16 and you

321
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:32,069
don't define a maximum length<font color="#E5E5E5"> and any</font>

322
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,829
more specific like / 21 / 20 force

323
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:36,360
they're all invalid and people are like

324
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:38,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what this maximum lengths</font>

325
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,250
thing is so I'm just going to leave it

326
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,680
blank for now and then in the process

327
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,720
create lots of imbalance<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

328
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,370
other thing was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people didn't</font>

329
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand that this is supposed</font>

330
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be about bgp origin so they were</font>

331
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,709
creating rose for a lots of upstream

332
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,170
things like three hopes down the line

333
00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:02,369
and I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> why why what are you</font>

334
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,589
doing so we yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't know</font>

335
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,930
what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> originate in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP they have no</font>

336
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,720
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still get these questions</font>

337
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,309
today it's like really is that what

338
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're announcing I was like yeah really</font>

339
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:17,910
so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> created rose they didn't match</font>

340
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,370
the vgp announcements at all nobody

341
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,019
understood maximum length and also and

342
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is also really complicated in the</font>

343
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that the standard first said it</font>

344
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,999
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really give you a lot of insight</font>

345
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:31,768
<font color="#CCCCCC">into what more specifics and do so more</font>

346
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:34,410
specifically overlaps with also less

347
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,300
specific overlaps and also partial

348
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,029
overlap so if you create a robot that

349
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,540
only partially overlaps with what you're

350
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,839
actually

351
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:45,589
announcing then what will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

352
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,360
those side effects were clear people

353
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,790
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solve that and plus</font>

354
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,949
you know we were sort of advertising if

355
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,660
you want to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own CA we're trying</font>

356
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:57,180
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some operational experience as</font>

357
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,670
well let us know we'll hand hold you

358
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:05,069
through the process and then we sort of

359
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:08,399
have 11 lar who was interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

360
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:11,550
running their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own CA that's really come</font>

361
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:16,170
on you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be wanting this right but</font>

362
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody cared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so then you start</font>

363
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,069
thinking how do we improve this and then

364
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,029
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole delegated see a thing you</font>

365
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:22,979
sort of put it on the back burner

366
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,709
because I was like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people</font>

367
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,680
testing this in pilot before we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

368
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:30,329
to production and because otherwise it's

369
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,399
going to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit pointless and</font>

370
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:34,969
maybe we should show people which

371
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,649
announcements they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll be fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

372
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,449
and then educate people about the

373
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">maximum prefix length how that is</font>

374
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,979
important you actually need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill it</font>

375
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,540
in and be really careful about it and we

376
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,360
were like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what let's also add</font>

377
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,699
an alerting system so if you do a new

378
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,600
announcement with one of your address

379
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:58,979
pay with one of your prefixes and you

380
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,290
have a new you have a new entry in the

381
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,449
list then we would send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an email</font>

382
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,668
saying you have a new announcement and

383
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:07,589
it has a status unknown maybe should<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

384
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:10,079
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system and create a role for it</font>

385
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,760
also if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> change your bgp</font>

386
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,040
configuration and something might

387
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,530
inadvertently be invalid it would also

388
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,480
send you a warning email and if somebody

389
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,069
was hijacking you it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> also send you</font>

390
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,079
a warning email that was kind of good

391
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,359
and this whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> drag and drop thing we</font>

392
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,428
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it it just needs to get</font>

393
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:32,428
rid of it the you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needed to be</font>

394
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:34,320
more intuitive so our second stop this

395
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:36,480
is what we came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with and I thought</font>

396
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,040
this is amazing again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it was</font>

397
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,600
amazing and it kind of was in the sense

398
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,850
that this was great for new users

399
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,459
because what we did here in this route

400
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">btp route validity column is that we</font>

401
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,570
took the right in to see route

402
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,040
collectors that that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gives you a</font>

403
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,300
bird's eye view of

404
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,770
all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route announcements that</font>

405
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,080
happen on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at any given</font>

406
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:01,500
point in time and we refresh that every

407
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,629
nine hours we just overlay everything

408
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,090
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route collectors see with your</font>

409
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,340
certified address space and if we've

410
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,629
chilled people these are all of the

411
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,010
announcements that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing with</font>

412
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,960
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> address space and this is also</font>

413
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,350
where this surprised reaction came from

414
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,780
who ain't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like really I do those</font>

415
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,120
announcements I had no idea I told these

416
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to stop doing that but apparently</font>

417
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,689
they're still doing it let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them</font>

418
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,420
a call this is really interesting why

419
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,060
didn't I notice before so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

420
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,070
validity column in that table it says

421
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,540
valid for all of them so you would start

422
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,689
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a clean slate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would say</font>

423
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,970
everything would be unknown great and

424
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,110
you could put check marks in front of

425
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of the authorized route</font>

426
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,929
announcements and you can hit that blue

427
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:49,440
button that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest rower because</font>

428
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:51,210
well there are best practices we could

429
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,680
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> people if you don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

430
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,910
will suggest a role for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

431
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,370
that's kind of good and we also added

432
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,350
this product tour where you would be

433
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,020
guided through all of the basic concepts

434
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:07,100
on how to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would sort</font>

435
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,810
of be it so the key difference is here

436
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,699
focus on all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp announcement so</font>

437
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,690
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route collectors to support all</font>

438
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,480
of this do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product or suggest row as</font>

439
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:22,140
based on best practices and also show

440
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,120
the effects before you publish so if you

441
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,670
would create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rower it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

442
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,610
an overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the affected bgp</font>

443
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:33,060
announcements saying if you publish this

444
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,740
now this is what will happen just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

445
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">know and then if you were completely</font>

446
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,420
happy with the result you could hit

447
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:43,139
publish and go and lastly like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said</font>

448
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,940
email alerts so what we saw dramatic

449
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,250
increase in uptake it was kind of

450
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,770
unbelievable and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fast vast</font>

451
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,590
improvement in data quality we have data

452
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,360
accuracy now that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> high in the high 90</font>

453
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,990
percent and even that is like a

454
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">flattered number because there's quite a</font>

455
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,820
few la RS that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I contact the thing you</font>

456
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,360
have lots of invalids and it went<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

457
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,899
yes we know those are our customers that

458
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,419
are still

459
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,600
announcing more specifics and we told

460
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,580
them repeatedly not to do that and now

461
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,169
we just created a<font color="#CCCCCC"> role for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our aggregate</font>

462
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,090
and now they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just all flagged as</font>

463
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:22,950
invalid they're supposed to be invalid

464
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,780
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so like to the 300 invalid</font>

465
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">route announcements in our repository</font>

466
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're actually properly invalid and if</font>

467
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:33,179
you would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop them you're</font>

468
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:35,580
rightfully doing that um but the problem

469
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this you I was is great for new</font>

470
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,899
users but if you would have like an

471
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,940
invalid route announcement somewhere it

472
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,190
would be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to track which roma</font>

473
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,590
is actually causing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was great</font>

474
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,900
for new users but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad for</font>

475
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,399
existing users in sort of maintaining

476
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,370
all of the stuff that they had already

477
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,950
created so they had invalids but they

478
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,899
wouldn't know how to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and also</font>

479
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,490
the way we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that interface and</font>

480
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,700
the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were used behind it</font>

481
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,830
it was wicked and was sort of old<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

482
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,630
bit crafty so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to delete some</font>

483
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,879
things you would hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> a button and it</font>

484
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:12,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">would refresh the page and that really</font>

485
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,390
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> very 2014 so we were like you</font>

486
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,970
know we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do better but this whole</font>

487
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,920
suggest roller thing i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing monthly</font>

488
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,280
webinars at that point explaining this

489
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,620
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was convinced that everybody</font>

490
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,360
was using this suggests rower feature I

491
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,389
was like why would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

492
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,300
but you know network operators day<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

493
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,580
better and they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> help they</font>

494
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,139
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that themselves and they</font>

495
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,290
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the driver's seat I don't</font>

496
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:43,440
need your stinking suggestions I know I

497
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do this myself look no hands I'm</font>

498
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,450
in control<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and the fact that</font>

499
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,860
that this whole do this stuff manually

500
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,350
that was really hidden on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second</font>

501
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,929
page because it was like we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

502
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,850
to design it around<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it turned</font>

503
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:03,030
out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we added event tracking</font>

504
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:05,399
that more than half was of the users was

505
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:08,100
creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> robbaz manually it wasn't using</font>

506
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,490
any of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest features so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

507
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,439
a bad design choice that we made so we

508
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,180
were like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what let's put this</font>

509
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,430
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> and center and put everything</font>

510
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">together on a single page and then also</font>

511
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,259
give a better indication of problem

512
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,149
matic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rose so stuff that you created and</font>

513
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,549
then at a later point it turned him

514
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:28,678
valid and it shows you exactly which

515
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:31,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">roma</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is causing a problem and how it is</font>

516
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,909
affecting certain bgp announcements and

517
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:36,990
then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had this discussion</font>

518
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:39,269
again about running your own CA and the

519
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback that we got was you know what I</font>

520
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:44,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to run my own CA but</font>

521
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,039
since I'm managing 500 vgp announcements

522
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:51,240
clicking around in your web interface

523
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,490
it's really getting tedious I don't

524
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that anymore so they</font>

525
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,080
maybe have a restful api so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

526
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:01,019
talk to your back-end system and I like

527
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,029
sure we can do that and we also add a

528
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,759
two-step verification because that is

529
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,620
sort of applies to all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font>

530
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,360
is also an important change that we made

531
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,399
to make sure that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we just lock</font>

532
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,139
everything down in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better way and we</font>

533
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:15,989
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future proof it in order to</font>

534
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:17,789
sort of make a new platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which we</font>

535
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,830
could extend functionality a lot easier

536
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the current one was really</font>

537
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:25,439
stretching the limits of what I could

538
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is our third step so a</font>

539
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,149
third generation you I after<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

540
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,209
that we learned along the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

541
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:37,439
what we came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with and it shows you at</font>

542
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:39,029
the top a summary there's 41 bgp

543
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,190
announcements that the ripe NCC does

544
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:44,970
this example is actually ripen to see

545
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:47,460
address space four of them are valid one

546
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,610
is invalid there are still 36 that are

547
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,649
unknown and this is caused by the four

548
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,928
rowers you create it and three of them

549
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:57,689
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and one of them is causing a</font>

550
00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:00,809
problem and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this interface</font>

551
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,580
works is you essentially put check marks

552
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,370
in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the authorized route</font>

553
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">announcements na sa create rose for</font>

554
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,629
selected bgp announcements and then in

555
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,879
the bottom right corner we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

556
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:14,039
button that this review and published

557
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:17,158
changes because you just made three

558
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,320
changes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may want to have a look</font>

559
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">at what that does so these are the</font>

560
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,460
rowers and those are the affected

561
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:25,229
announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you're happy you</font>

562
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,000
can just hit publish we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added some</font>

563
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,649
filter button so you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font>

564
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,240
valid and maybe you want to hide all of

565
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:30,939
that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you care about what is</font>

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">unknown</font>

567
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,290
and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> roller</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> section you can see</font>

568
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,900
this one is causing a problem if you

569
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:40,590
click it it's like ah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that rower</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

570
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,090
causing an invalid length let's fix it

571
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,740
you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new roller you can</font>

572
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:48,310
extend a maximum length<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an existing</font>

573
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">rower or look ma no hands I'm going to</font>

574
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,909
do a manual fix because that is what

575
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:54,190
users want they want to be in the

576
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,080
driver's seat your<font color="#E5E5E5"> review you change it</font>

577
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,930
again and it will go from invalid the

578
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,429
valid you publish and off you go and now

579
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,910
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top right corner you see there</font>

580
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:05,740
now 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> / 0 us causing problems the thing</font>

581
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:09,100
is is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we brought everything</font>

582
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:11,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to a single page and you have three</font>

583
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,199

584
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,600
view you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your rower point of view</font>

585
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,070
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP announcements and the related</font>

586
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,719
row us and on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other page you have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your rollers and their related BGP</font>

589
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,550
entire audit history so every step that

590
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:30,219
every user took to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stage</font>

591
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:33,669
where you're at now to see who missed

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,690
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your system and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a good</font>

593

starting point for adding additional

594
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:45,070
functionality because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to this</font>

595
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:47,260
point by gathering lots and lots and

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,379
lots of feedback and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that because</font>

597
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:53,040
all of this functionality is part of a

meetings we make sure that we use social

606
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,280
media in a good way because building a

now tell us what they really tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us is</font>

we've on data faster if there is new

these are PGI validators these relying

636
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,920
they upped if they used to update every

637
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,320
four hours and now they update every two

638
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,000
hours but but operators really want this

639
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,350
in minutes if as soon as there's

640
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,590
something new out there they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to know about it again the running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

642
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,010
delegated model is just not that

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting the only compelling argument</font>

644
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hurt right now was an</font>

645
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,729
organization who has resources from all

646
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:57,210
of the five regional internet registries

647
00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:00,590
so if they will make a change then they

648
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,790
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log into one of the five</font>

649
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,740
interfaces and those are five different

650
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,240
interfaces and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to deal</font>

651
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that so they're like you know what</font>

652
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,070
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run our own CA we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

653
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,629
in one centralized place we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

654
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:17,399
manage everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is currently</font>

655
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:21,900
well I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best argument for doing</font>

656
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:24,780
up um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we used to have</font>

657
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,210
still root objects and now we have still

658
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,760
row us there's lots of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who go in</font>

659
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,580
make changes don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable the alerting</font>

660
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,620
system and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just walk away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

661
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:37,080
forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then you have stale</font>

662
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,330
data also what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have with Ruth</font>

663
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,790
objects is if there is one missing

664
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,070
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very keen to add a new one</font>

665
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,500
but who has ever removed the root object

666
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,600
it's like oh that's old<font color="#E5E5E5"> Croft let's just</font>

667
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,610
get rid of it nobody does that there's

668
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,689
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lots of cruft it's actually the</font>

669
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:56,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">same with rowers there's lots of unused</font>

670
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,549
11 so there are way more robust than are

671
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,529
actually

672
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:01,149
cessary to validate all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

673
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:04,299
announcements and then the last

674
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">complaint is you have these three</font>

675
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:09,879
statuses with rpki essentially something

676
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:13,090
can be valid so it's covered by<font color="#CCCCCC"> aurora</font>

677
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:16,119
it can be invalid because it's coming

678
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:19,029
from an unauthorized<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s or it is more</font>

679
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:22,869
specific than is allowed by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum</font>

680
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:26,289
length but there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to distinguish</font>

681
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:29,320
between those two in my router whereas

682
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:30,999
operators say well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think actually one</font>

683
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">is less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the other if</font>

684
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:36,820
it's coming from an authorized a yes but

685
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,730
it's just too specific that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less of</font>

686
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">an offense then an invalid where it's</font>

687
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,139
truly<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from an unauthorized a yes</font>

688
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,908
but there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to distinguish</font>

689
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:48,189
between that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example in your cisco</font>

690
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:51,309
and juniper<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers you can only create</font>

691
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,320
a route map based on invalid and there's

692
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:55,480
no way to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's do one or the</font>

693
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,239
other so that's another thing that we

694
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,309
get a little feedback about we try to

695
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:03,940
sort of circumvent apt in our relying

696
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:06,460
party software we we also built in a

697
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,830
RESTful API where you can filter on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

698
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,269
but then you can create filters outside

699
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,129
of your router but if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

700
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:14,739
this natively in your router you don't

701
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:17,619
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that option so what are our</font>

702
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:20,710
future plans if you have such a fancy

703
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:23,019
interface why don't use it for root

704
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,879
objects as well because right now if you

705
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:26,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to manage your routing data you</font>

706
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:28,988
essentially have to do it in two

707
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:31,960

708
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:34,299
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely different data sets that</font>

709
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,399
have no relation nothing to do with each

710
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">other but because we now have</font>

711
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,070
authentication in the right database

712
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:43,720
using single sign on as well as

713
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,939
two-factor authentication you could just

714
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,399
essentially merge all of that in so

715
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,200
those tabs that I showed you you can

716
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,289
essentially just add a fourth tab SE

717
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,820
rooth objects you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage all</font>

718
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,070
of your route objects from exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

719
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,259
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> place or it could be as simple as</font>

720
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,749
adding a single check mark saying create

721
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:03,909
matching<font color="#CCCCCC"> root object for this row or</font>

722
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:07,269
even the other way around<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's</font>

723
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:08,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">lots of options are playing at that then</font>

724
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:11,230
with regards to getting the data out

725
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:13,570
faster currently all

726
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,460
fetching of all of the objects out of

727
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:18,100
the repositories is done over<font color="#E5E5E5"> our sink</font>

728
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,870
if you know how r sync works actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

729
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,969
calculating the differences the server

730
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,510
is involved so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want data</font>

731
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:28,240
faster we could you say sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's up</font>

732
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:30,820
the polling time but we have 11,000

733
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,120
members and if all of them wants new

734
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,939
data every minute and they also

735
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,610
occurring our repository over our sink

736
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:43,510
than 11,000 every minute that's going to

737
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:46,270
be lots and lots of server stuff that we

738
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in in order to be capable of</font>

739
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,290
handling that and also the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

740
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:52,000
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain routing working</font>

741
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,139
group they<font color="#CCCCCC"> write you know that is</font>

742
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,910
actually something that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

743
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,919
at so currently we're building a

744
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:59,020
prototype to replace our sink that's

745
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:03,700
something more scalable and something

746
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:05,740
faster HTTP then of course we'll need to

747
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:09,820
deal altima tlie will need to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

748
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:13,960
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terraria or transfers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron will run</font>

749
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,399
out of address space to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the desire to do</font>

750
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,960
more transfers there's already a

751
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,400
transfer agreement in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Terraria our</font>

752
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,190
transfer agreement between the iron

753
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,770
region in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the apt region ultimately the</font>

754
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,679
expectation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that will happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

755
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:29,110
ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> ncc region as well and then lastly</font>

756
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,809
there's paw validation because origin

757
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:34,030
validation is fun but you know you could

758
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:37,120
still spoof<font color="#E5E5E5"> an AS number and then</font>

759
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:39,100
announce something and it would still in

760
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,049
the current rpki system be marked as

761
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,389
valid because it doesn't support pal

762
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:45,070
validation and ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think by the</font>

763
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,970
end of the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

764
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:51,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">will need to start looking at so</font>

765
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:55,960
everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've told you has</font>

766
00:32:51,669 --> 00:33:00,940
resulted in this so when we started our

767
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,830
are picky I initiative in the first

768
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:06,040
month we got a lot of uptake and I was

769
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,389
really surprised by it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

770
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,000
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to flat I</font>

771
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,490
know if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to maybe lose</font>

772
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,679
interest we just got critical mass

773
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,679
everybody who said you know I did the in

774
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:20,760
a sec I did ipv6 and I have a lazy

775
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,930
friday afternoon let's set up some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roiz</font>

776
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,360
that'll be fun

777
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:28,330
but it turns out that this just keeps on

778
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,090
growing and the amount of you for

779
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:33,370
requesting a certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is fairly</font>

780
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:36,459
constant but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

781
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">with people creating rowers and I think</font>

782
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:42,820
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most telling graph with</font>

783
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:45,850
regards to product design and sort of

784
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:48,399
advocating usability of a product

785
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:51,820
because this is the day when we launched

786
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,290
our second generation you I the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

787
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,480
one with the drag-and-drop interface

788
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">nobody was creating row us and we had</font>

789
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,550
really poor data quality and from the

790
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:02,379
day we launched the user interface that

791
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,590
showed people what they actually

792
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,360
originated in BGP there is an enormous

793
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">uptake in people creating rowers and</font>

794
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,279
these were all high quality rowers and

795
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,800
right now if I start looking at the

796
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,780
statistics people are removing bro us

797
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,700
because it's easier to spot<font color="#E5E5E5"> Croft and</font>

798
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,970
the data quality is going even further

799
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:23,889
up so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effect of putting in</font>

800
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:25,719
effort in making something<font color="#E5E5E5"> usable and</font>

801
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:28,690
that is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what my talk is about</font>

802
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,909
because you could just say we're going

803
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,220
to make it technically work we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

804
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the functionality is</font>

805
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:39,009
in place so users are capable of

806
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:41,560
performing this task and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it</font>

807
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:45,090
done and to be totally honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font>

808
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,679
the ripe NCC is very guilty of that too

809
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:51,700
just go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our website now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and try to</font>

810
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:56,109
sign up as a member we we give you nine

811
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:58,270
pages of hell and we don't care we're

812
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:01,810
monopoly right where else are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going</font>

813
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:05,740
to go so we can throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up as many burning</font>

814
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:08,640
hoops and we disregarded usability for a

815
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:11,169
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we didn't need to and</font>

816
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,210
now with this increased focus on

817
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,160
usability and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it</font>

818
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">user-friendly you can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it pays</font>

819
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,500
dividends in how your product is

820
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:23,259
perceived and and the extent in which

821
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,140
your product is<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and it also taught</font>

822
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,640
me a lot about early adopters people who

823
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,920
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in this new technology</font>

824
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,740
and give you feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how it is</font>

825
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used operationally</font>

826
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,520
because like I said in the beginning in

827
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,310
2011 we really

828
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,470
no idea we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> had no idea what we</font>

829
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,720
were getting into and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helped</font>

830
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,310
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape this user interface that we</font>

831
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,890
have now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adoption that we have</font>

832
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:49,650
now based on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the feedback that we</font>

833
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:52,109
got from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adopters and then</font>

834
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,330
lastly there's lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> education people</font>

835
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,270
understanding this system if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain</font>

836
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:59,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">it really a lot of operators say why</font>

837
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:02,120
isn't this mandatory why isn't everybody

838
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:06,140
just doing this it just makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

839
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:08,549
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just works and I</font>

840
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,640
download this relying party software I

841
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,440
can hook it into my juniper or my cisco

842
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,140
it's just an end-to-end system that

843
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,300
works it's fine and we got a lot of

844
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:22,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">flack I mean this hasn't been an easy</font>

845
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,970
road in 2011 you know the membership

846
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:28,170
even voted on whether we wanted this

847
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:29,399
system yes or no and then ultimately I

848
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,830
have a feeling that that was a very

849
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,840
secluded discussion and that that

850
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:36,360
happened inside a room but<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

852
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,800
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually kind of a usable</font>

system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to invest in this and</font>

854
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,940
now we've got like twenty percent of the

855
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:48,180
membership that has a certificate and we

856
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:51,030
got almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine / 8 worth of address</font>

857
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,819
space that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aurora it's a</font>

858
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,950
lot of address space so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get a high</font>

859
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:59,300
quality usable data set and now we can

860
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:02,430
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> build further it's really nice and</font>

861
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,440
what I'm wondering about is well this

862
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,839
obviously isn't happening in the Aaron

863
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:12,300
region and I'm curious to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you</font>

864
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:14,690
why any questions or any comments thank

865
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,690
you very much

866
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:25,220
see people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the mic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here we have time</font>

867
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:29,150

868
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:34,189
IJ as usual Alex you've done a brilliant

869
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:37,880
job but there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic rule of the</font>

870
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:41,599
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and especially the IRRs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rirs</font>

871
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,940
that you have violated and that calls

872
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,420
the all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this into question which is</font>

873
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:50,240
that you have treated the operators as

874
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,839
if they were paying customers that's

875
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not done these are slime we</font>

876
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,220
supposed to throw rules at them and make

877
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,010
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to deny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those address</font>

878
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:03,259
space and deny them service you have

879
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">taken an approach of serving customers</font>

880
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:17,599
and that's just you can see the failure

881
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:20,990
sorry Andrew Alex look it's no secret

882
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:25,069
that I have my name is Andrew I'm from

883

liquid telecom it's no secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

884
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:30,079
have great reservations about rpki for

885
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:33,440
various reasons particularly with

886
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,530
regards to handing the rirs too much

887
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,760
control etc but leaving those aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

888
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:43,130
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question typically speaking the</font>

889
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:47,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">RIR model has always worked on a</font>

890
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:49,160
consensus approach now in 2011 my

891
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:53,089
understanding is that a policy was put

892
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,980
forward before ripe that said we'd like

893
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:56,810
right to turn this thing into a

894
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,480
production service and it was withdrawn

895
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:02,000
at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it went to a membership</font>

896
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,609
vote in ripe yeah and the second option

897
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,160
on that membership vote was whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

898
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:11,420
not the members felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right should</font>

899
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:15,098
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to issue the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RAS that vote was</font>

900
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:19,880
passed<font color="#E5E5E5"> 102 what was defeated a hundred</font>

901
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:22,160
122 114 with 26 abstentions yeah would

902
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,250
you not feel that that violates the

903
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,649
consensus model on which the rirs have

904
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:32,960
been built since time immemorial it

905
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:36,230
makes me<font color="#CCCCCC"> very nervous to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

906
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,599
that when the consensus model has worked

907
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,430
for so long with all other policies and

908
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,310
then we see something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that because</font>

909
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:45,348
it makes it very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to me that this</font>

910
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:48,049
is something very controversial and

911
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:53,000
could have huge ramifications on the

912
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:56,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet going forward would you like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

913
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,980
to comment I really would like you like

914
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hear a response to that yeah because</font>

915
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,569
it's it's it was a very complicated time

916
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:06,369
and it's no secret that this was a very

917
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:09,380
contentious issue better the rer should

918
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:11,540
or let's not speak for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> re</font>

921

up which all said members of our

923
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:25,369
Executive Board in it and and ultimately

924
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:28,040
they didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision by</font>

925
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:30,560
themselves but they said you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

926
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:34,310
general meeting we're going to call a

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,730
vote and an ultimately the photos past

928
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:42,020
albeit with a thin margin yes but that

929
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:45,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what voting ultimately is I think</font>

930
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,119
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned a lot along the way and I</font>

931
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:50,630
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also taught to ripen to see to</font>

932
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:54,109
be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more humble when it</font>

933
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:55,670
comes to these kinds of delicate issues

934
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:58,940
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely something that we</font>

935
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:00,829
learned from and now that there is a

936
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,859
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more operational experience</font>

937
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:05,990
with this system and now that there's

938
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:09,109
more knowledge about how the system

939
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,439
works I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those fears and a</font>

940
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:14,660
lot of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubts have been taken away</font>

941
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,150
and I think we're in much better shape I

942
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:20,410
think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really have the feeling this</font>

943
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:22,880
is truly personally speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feeling</font>

944
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you would have this vote again</font>

945
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:30,619
today it the outcome would actually be a

946
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:33,650
lot more positive hiya Doug Montgomery

947
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:37,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">nest so you talked about using the</font>

948
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:40,579
user interface as sharing that with the

953
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,589
set to populate the other while finding

00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:01,160
inconsistencies from one data set to the

00:41:57,589 --> 00:42:03,440
other it did speaking purely for the

956
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,690
ripe database the right database because

957
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,569
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to authenticate against both</font>

00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:22,700
the data consistency there is actually

962
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:25,130
kind of good so we could opt to show all

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root announcements and all of the</font>

00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,990

00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,710
is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eligible for rpki this</font>

993
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,090
print it'll be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in two weeks and</font>

994
00:43:54,710 --> 00:44:03,180
then all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will have rellis</font>

995
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:06,600
finally and maybe you go first yeah so

996
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,910
more coasters there I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so I</font>

997
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,350
just wanted to comment a little bit from

998
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,839
the technical services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin</font>

999
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:14,750
provides and that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very close to</font>

1000
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you have with a couple exceptions</font>

1001
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:24,570
we have delegated we have hosted we have

1002
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:27,450
a a a restful interface to our hosted

1003
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:31,320
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I encourage you that if you</font>

1004
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:32,970
can to join in the fun yeah that would

1005
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,420
be fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't it and maybe we should</font>

1006
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:38,970
also align our api's so people can use

1007
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,340
the same calls for both so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1008
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,169
brings up something that's it we've

1009
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:47,190
talked about this with the regional

1010
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:49,800
registries yeah the api's are going to

1011
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,390
be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit different especially in</font>

1012
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,680
the air in region and the reason for

1013
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:58,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we actually have some measures</font>

1014
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,379
put into place that only you as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

1015
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:03,960
can actually create rose and the way

1016
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,030
that's done is with<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two-factor</font>

1017
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,150
authentication approach and that's also

1018
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in the RESTful API yeah and you</font>

1019
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,090
do not have that within the right region

1020
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:16,560
now is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole new repudiation part</font>

1021
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:18,900
that was mandatory within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

1022
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,910
region none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other rers have that</font>

1023
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,300
implemented so that makes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1024
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:26,339
more complicated for you in ortho for

1025
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,070
such a service it was totally true well

1026
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:32,190
we already have and have for about a

1027
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:36,750
year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple months now yeah that</font>

1028
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:39,359
you but if you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may ask you have all</font>

1029
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that functionality what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

1030
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,819
with your adoption that's a really good

1031
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:50,430
question and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I would really</font>

1032
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to hear from the audience okay one</font>

1033
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:57,450
last it make it quick please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'm</font>

1034
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:59,368
andrew from liquid<font color="#CCCCCC"> again Alex I'm going</font>

1035
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:03,509
to ask you a question

1036
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:07,480
quick if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were sitting in a situation</font>

1037
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:10,270
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR were sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a country</font>

1038
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:13,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was willing to sign whatever</font>

1039
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:17,230
treaties the itu threw up at wizard on a

1040
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,299
continent where the continent is full of

1041
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,190
governments full of dictators that are

1042
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,550
loving to sign treaties that love to

1043
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:28,390
withdraw things and and and exercise

1044
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:31,660
complete control would you be willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1045
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:34,359
put that kind of power in the hands of

1046
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:38,379
an RA are hosted in a region like that

1047
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:41,619
and would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you trust and RI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are in that</font>

1048
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,930
suit is situation to sign your roots and

1049
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:49,200
potentially affect your root reach

1050
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:51,970
ability yeah I'll make it really quick

1051
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,069
this is a discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've had over</font>

1052
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:57,609
the last couple of years like oh my god

1053
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:59,200
rpki it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with certificates in</font>

1054
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:01,960
something with signing and cryptography

1055
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,149
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really powerful the the</font>

1056
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,339
cryptography that is added to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our pki is</font>

1057
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:09,010
meant for validation something is signed

1058
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:12,339
allowing the other party to validate it

1059
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:15,339
it offers reliability it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1060
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:17,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">than a more reliable root object so you</font>

1061
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:19,480
could do the same things with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a root</font>

1062
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:21,579
object in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition if you want to do</font>

1063
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,710
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> really powerful then you could</font>

1064
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:25,390
also say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to revoke all of your</font>

1065
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,060
address space for this is be

1066
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:30,009
deregistered them and that'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

1067
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,109
everything disappear that'll make their

1068
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,060
database objects disappear they'll make

1069
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:36,369
their certificate disappear that'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

1070
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,130
everything disappear their reverse

1071
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:41,890
delegations everything that is a much

1072
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:45,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful way of shutting down an</font>

1073
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:47,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">isv singling out rpki because this is</font>

1074
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:50,709
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of perceived as something powerful</font>

1075
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:55,060
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> deals with something about</font>

1076
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:57,849
certificates is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not true the</font>

1077
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:01,029
means to shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP are already</font>

1078
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:07,589
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> and rpki doesn't really change</font>

1079
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:07,589
that thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks very much</font>

1080
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,880
you

1081
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,330
