00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,490
so just to kind of

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,960
set the stage here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to run</font>

00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,180
through a bunch of botnet takedowns

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are familiar with any of these ever</font>

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:33,040

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,719
may not realize there's this sort of

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,970
growing frustration that people have

16
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,759
with what's been going on in terms of

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybercrime and I bet if I asked how many</font>

18
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,539
people here of directly or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:13,310

numbers stolen or your computer

21
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,410
compromised and have to clean it up so

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,039
at least the impact on computers is

23
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:25,520
starting to be pretty prevalent

24
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:27,709
financial losses and bigger so I wanted

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to thank the program committee for</font>

26
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:33,349
allowing this discussion because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

27
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,720
involvement of you guys and I want to

28
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:37,459
mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part of Homeland Security</font>

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">has been funding some research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

30
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:44,270
back a number of years to try to look at

31
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:47,419
the ethical issues regarding computer

32
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,069
security research and that's starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

33
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,200
bleed into the operational realm so

34
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:54,619
we're continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at that as well</font>

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,929
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that I'm here is to kind</font>

36
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,759
of discuss some of these activities<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

37
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:00,470
going on so if you were to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

38
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,500
there was some kind of an advisory body

39
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:07,280
that wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with groups like the</font>

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:10,280
AV industry Microsoft law enforcement to

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,900
try to take some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these criminal</font>

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,900
botnets down take them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of control of</font>

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,900
criminals

44
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,960
what is your role are you involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

45
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:26,140
all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to have this</font>

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,670
dialogue with you to understand how does

47
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,190
this community who's going after these

48
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:34,140
botnets supposed to be interacting with

49
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,140
network providers and platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> writers</font>

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,460
Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> vixy has been talking for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a while</font>

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,680
and heat in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is based on</font>

52
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,580
something that he mentioned sitting

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,020
range of the moment black them all a lot

54
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of times when people are trying to take</font>

55
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,600
over botnets they don't fully take them

56
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,010
out of control the bad guys and a lot of

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel that the only way to really</font>

58
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,880
stop this is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get people</font>

59
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind bars or get them in front of a</font>

60
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,750
court so part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is about how do</font>

61
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:07,600
you have a more lasting impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> crime</font>

62
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,240
but doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a way that minimizes the</font>

63
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,269
potential harm and a lot of this

64
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,050
frustration is due to the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

65
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,610
and in democratic societies the law is

66
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,800
supposed to be deliberative it's

67
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,790
supposed to be fair in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font>

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,209
you're innocent until you're proven

69
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,790
guilty but when somebody finds evidence

70
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,680
of crime because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer has been</font>

71
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,900
compromised and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find evidence of</font>

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,200
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some criminals are doing</font>

73
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,480
you may report<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to law enforcement and</font>

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,000
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sudden you don't hear anything</font>

75
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,179
and once later you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still don't hearing</font>

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,620
and you think I gave information law

77
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,260
enforcement how come somebody has not

78
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,620
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrested well the legal process is</font>

79
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,810
slow and it's slow for a number of

80
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,209
reasons and there are multiple parts to

81
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,989
it so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't understand</font>

82
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:01,450
there's civil process<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft has been</font>

using<font color="#E5E5E5"> civil legal process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emperor a</font>

using them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> commit crime the criminal</font>

90
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,500
prosecute somebody but if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

91
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,260
in the grand jury the grand jury is a

92
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,930
secretive process it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in</font>

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to protect innocent people so if</font>

94
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,180
you give something a law enforcement and

95
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:33,280
there

96
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,810
actually investigating something don't

97
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect them to say anything about it</font>

98
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,900
they can't confirm that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an</font>

99
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,600
investigation going on they can't say

100
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,000
anything about the process and if you

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,910
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something in most of</font>

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,930
these botnets span the globe so if

103
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,539
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something involving</font>

104
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,430
criminal process and it involves law

105
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,099
enforcement or evidence that has to be

106
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,789
obtained from a different country<font color="#CCCCCC"> M lat</font>

107
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,190
is mutual legal assistance treaty and

108
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:03,909
it's a process that and takes sometimes

109
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,430
a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> or more to fully execute so</font>

110
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,919
whether is more cooperation between law

111
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,940
enforcement agencies around the world

112
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:15,070
certain things still take a really long

113
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,740
now if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are talking about doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

114
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:22,030
aggressive things to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take control</font>

115
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,560
away from bad guys this is kind of a

116
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">little humorous example but it really</font>

117
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,440
makes the point so in this Indiana Jones

118
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:31,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">movie they had this scene that was</font>

119
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,669
choreographed where this seminar

120
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,650
wielding guy is attacking Indiana Jones

121
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,889
and the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are standing around</font>

122
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,659
in the market they're far enough away so

123
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,949
if the guy with the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> attar is</font>

124
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,169
swinging it nobody's going to get hurt

125
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:48,760
and Indiana Jones was<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to use</font>

126
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:50,650
his whip to take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this Harrison</font>

127
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,229
Florida actually had dysentery during

128
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,698
the scene and he said look this is

129
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,960
taking way too much time I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

130
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,120
get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> here what if I pull my gun</font>

131
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,520
out and shoot the guy so he pulls his

132
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,080
gun out and he shoots him and take you

133
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,169
know it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene everybody loves</font>

134
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it's really funny he's using deadly</font>

135
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,940
force against somebody who is not even

136
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to him look at all the people</font>

137
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,460
standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind so he's much more likely</font>

138
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,349
to actually kill somebody who's innocent

139
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,780
than he is to kill the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad guy and even</font>

140
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,310
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he kills the bad guy in the act of</font>

141
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,719
killing the bad guy the bullet may /

142
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,090
penetrate may hit some innocent person

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,669
so the whole idea is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

144
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,400
about all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stakeholders are</font>

145
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:32,349
involved everyone who is in this scene

146
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,849
here and with the internet it's very

147
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,370
difficult to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are</font>

148
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:39,159
standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right behind the bad guy or in</font>

00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:44,430

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,469
the thing that are at risk

152
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,349
so I've been involved in studying this

153
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,720
for a really long time I was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

aspects of distribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> denial of service</font>

156
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,128

157
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,620
really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and involves</font>

158
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,470
sometimes hundreds of sites and you'll

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,470
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know your customers or</font>

00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:53,949

don't learn and counter that but every

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,340
now and then you'll find that somebody

180

knows something that's critical and

181
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,440
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all these other entities that</font>

you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of falling into a gray area</font>

187
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:19,960

accessing a system without authorization

202
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:58,060
now you have people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go in</font>

203
00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:00,640
and shut things down

believed were sharing copyright material

<font color="#E5E5E5">one a lot of people are understanding</font>

happen to have a back door so there was

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:56,050
a whole bunch of problems you didn't

226

have any way of uninstalling it so the

227
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,300
main point here is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

228
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,310

with assets that are owned by somebody

a botnet that has million infected

237
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,440
computers and you know that the bad guy

238
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,319
is using them and you want to take them

239
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,910
out of their hands it's pretty simple to

240
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,250
just run a piece of malware in a sandbox

241
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,350
get passwords a whole bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

242

that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do to learn how its</font>

243
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,710
functioning but then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,560
go farther and farther down

this path of technical difficulty to

256
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,819
achieve a difficult objective taking

over the botnet or shutting it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">much more than the technical difficulty</font>

whereas you're talking about doing

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,349
certain things blocking domain names as

263
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:38,430
if there's a piece of malware the

intercept requests to search engines and

directs those to some system that

medical things to try and understand how

able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clearly articulate how you came</font>

292
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,420
to that decision you don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm</font>

293
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,490
doing this because I'm an ethical person

294
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,199
you do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you say there's a</font>

295
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,390
certain principle I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fold</font>

296
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,110
this principle balancing that against

297
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:08,890
other ethical principles and when you

298
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:11,680
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about ethics I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a philosopher</font>

299
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:16,240
but I've read a lot about this so you'll

300
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,180
see some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that are a little</font>

301
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,850
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar there's this framework</font>

302
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,339
based on norms and<font color="#CCCCCC"> rules and if you</font>

303
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,529
follow rules the Bible says thou shalt

304
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,839
not kill

305
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,999
so in a time of war<font color="#E5E5E5"> some Christians will</font>

306
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,490
say cannot go to war because you're

307
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:35,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">killing people you were violating what</font>

308
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,649
the Bible<font color="#E5E5E5"> said so under this torture is</font>

00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,980
always wrong you never should do it

310
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:44,730
doesn't matter what and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that brings up</font>

311
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,309
the conflict the no matter what<font color="#E5E5E5"> art what</font>

312
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,949
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consequences if you focus on the</font>

313
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:52,379
outcomes rather than the rules you may

314
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:56,099
say if I save a certain number of lives

315
00:13:52,379 --> 00:14:00,480
torturing somebody is worthwhile or<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

316
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,939
this gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> into anti-abortion you kill an</font>

317
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,309
abortionist you're saving some unknown

318
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:07,439
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of lives therefore the fact that</font>

319
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:10,259
it's murder doesn't matter there is a

320
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:12,059
higher law this consequences the thing

321
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,509
that's most important so those directly

322
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:18,959
conflict with each other there's this

323
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:20,759
other philosophy of virtue ethics where

324
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,949
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the rules you don't</font>

325
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus on the actions focus on who's</font>

326
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:29,579
doing them and you look at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is their</font>

327
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,990
history do they have they exhibited over

328
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:33,620
time the ability to reason through

329
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,809
things and come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decisions that are</font>

330
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:40,740
similar and that are consistent over

331
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:42,509
time and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> under the virtue ethics</font>

332
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:48,000
perspective and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a book on</font>

333
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:49,500
virtue ethics in regard to war if you're

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right person doing the right thing</font>

335
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:56,309
at the right time now all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

336
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're showing that you are the right</font>

337
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:00,839
person and that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing the right</font>

338
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,369
thing and you're comparing that with

339
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,850
other things that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the wrong</font>

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing and being able to explain how you</font>

Markham is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a philosopher and has</font>

345
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:27,959
done some work on how your ethical

346
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,370
framework should exhibit itself in your

347

crime arguably as a world fixing at want

to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for</font>

351
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,390
certain group of people but what are

00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,699
what is that group of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

353
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,439
those stakeholder is the thing that

00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,750
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that they would</font>

355
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,610
say I want you to do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a</font>

356
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,290
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for you to do or would they</font>

357
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,660
say what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell why did you do that</font>

358
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,730
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost me something you just</font>

359
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,530
impacted me in a negative way and I

360
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:04,750
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> being bothered before but now I'm</font>

361
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:08,589
bothered so need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to interpret what</font>

362
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,900
people in what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will take out of</font>

363
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:16,450
whatever your actions are in deciding

what those action to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> part department</font>

365
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:22,150
homeland security has been looking at

366
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:24,910
this since 2009<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of research</font>

367
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,730
ethics like I say and there is a

368
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:31,060
published report we called a<font color="#E5E5E5"> manual</font>

369
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,860
report and a companion guide I neglected

370
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,079
to put the companion guide in the

371
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,240
references that are in the back of the

372
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,820
slide deck you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find it on my</font>

373
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,460
homepage I may try to update the slides

374
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:47,590
and put them at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL that what's on</font>

375
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:50,110
slides here so we have this document out

376
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:52,300
now we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to socialize it in the</font>

377
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,940
research community<font color="#E5E5E5"> Katherine carpenter</font>

378
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,449
and I are socializing it an operational

379
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,000
community and trying to come up with

380
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,820
some way of changing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that we</font>

381
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,400
look at these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and the you'll see</font>

382
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,320
that under respect for persons an

383
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,480
informed consent is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

384
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,579
people think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot to tell people</font>

385
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,240
what you're doing they should opt in or

386
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:18,280
have the ability to opt out identifying

387
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,680
who the stakeholders are is the first

388
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,040
step to figuring out how to engage with

389
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and get their permission so there</font>

390
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:30,070
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> three principal groups the primary</font>

391
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,100
stakeholders are those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you</font>

392
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,980
are arguably trying to benefit for the

393
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">primary beneficiaries of whatever this</font>

394
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,580
goodness is that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

395
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">deliver and because there are criminals</font>

396
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:47,220
who are doing malicious things against

397
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:49,810
them you want to understand boo benefits

398
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,480
negatively from the stuff that's going

399
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,168
on there's an ecosystem people sell

400
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,899
credit

401
00:17:53,169 --> 00:18:00,100
they sell virtual private network

402
00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:02,168
services that prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace back they do</font>

403
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,070
bulletproof hosting so that you don't

404
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:07,899
take downs of resource so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're the</font>

405
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:12,330
secondary stakeholder population are

406
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:15,908
ones who are intermediaries in delivery

407
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:18,939
so network provider platform provider

408
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:21,399
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> key stakeholders are those</font>

409
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,609
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are acting who actually have</font>

410
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:26,018
an impact on the outcome so you as a

00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:28,480
researcher trying to understand

412
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:30,700
something or the bad guys who are using

413
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,059
this resource to try to steal credit

414
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,989
cards to gain financially so you want to

415
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:40,720
put people<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the proper group now</font>

416
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:43,450

437
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,449
or they may look like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy because</font>

438
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,950
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this network and if</font>

439
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,249
you're doing something against them but

440
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:48,340
blue entity at the bottom say they

441
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:49,960
decide we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent this</font>

442
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,269
service from functioning by doing a

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,460

444
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:55,989
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending a flood of traffic the</font>

00:19:55,989 --> 00:20:00,820
network providers at the bottom goes

447
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,539
through the platform provider if you

448
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,759
disrupt the networks in transit you

449
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:08,789
affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of innocent third parties</font>

450
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:12,399
if you affect the platform you have

451
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:14,919
impact negatively this huge number of

452
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:16,389
people it up if you said those were the

453
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,679
ones you were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serve but you</font>

454
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:24,008
actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to harm them</font>

455
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:27,309
that's not the outcome that you want so

456
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:29,499
I'll walk through a case here just to

457
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,149
kind of you know go through this from

458
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:32,619
the perspective of looking at all the

459
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:35,529
stakeholders and trying to understand

460
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:37,869
who benefits who gains is this the right

461
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:41,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this case is</font>

462
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:43,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on a system called hyper vm which</font>

463
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:46,658
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization platform that's used</font>

464
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:49,119
for creating storefronts and clock so is

465
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:52,859
the administrative<font color="#CCCCCC"> front-end the system</font>

466
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:56,678
was developed by a company in india now

467
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:59,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody anonymously nobody knows who it</font>

468
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,849
is looks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and discoverers i</font>

469
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,190
think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was over a hundred</font>

470
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:05,799
vulnerabilities many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which would give</font>

471
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:09,609
you full root access full command

00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:13,479
control of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole thing so contacts</font>

473
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:15,489
the vendor and says<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found all these</font>

474
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:17,739
bugs I have a proof of concept it's on

475
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:19,989
my web server you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to fix this and</font>

476
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:24,190
gets a response back a couple days later

477
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:27,609
from somebody and it wasn't named sure

478
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:32,469
I'll look into this guy waits a week or

479
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:35,439
gal<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever nobody knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if d-dog week</font>

480
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:38,049
later hey you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the</font>

481
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,929
stuff you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at it person says</font>

482
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:42,668
sorry for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> delay I'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

483
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:44,879
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next couple of hours still</font>

484
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:47,529
have no idea who it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's responding</font>

485
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:49,599
couple days later still hasn't touched

486
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:52,119
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay person who did the research gets</font>

487
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,428
pissed off says<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right these guys are</font>

488
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,249
not doing anything I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix</font>

489
00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:00,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">this because they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to save everybody</font>

490
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:02,919
who uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so makes it fully available</font>

491
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:05,649
full disclosure the whole thing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

492
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,019
day later somebody breaks into a site da

493
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:11,439
cert in the UK they have a hundred

494
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:13,389
thousand users on the system person uses

495
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,029
the vulnerability wipes out everything

496
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:18,758
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole cyst and they weren't doing</font>

497
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:20,380
backups properly so a hundred thousand

498
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:22,060
users many of whom were

499
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,740
businesses they're completely out of

500
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:28,419
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> for days while they try to</font>

501
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:34,330
recover so following day the CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

502
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:37,030
company is found dead of suicide now who

503
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,490
knows probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't commit suicide</font>

504
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,610
just because of this may have another

505
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:47,950
stress why wasn't somebody answering

506
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,479
right away who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> but how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surtsey see</font>

507
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,420
if you were to go to CC with this

508
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,420
vulnerability their guidelines say 45

509
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:59,200
days the vendor doesn't respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 45</font>

510
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:02,320
days then figure out how to escalate the

511
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,110
organization for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet safety they</font>

512
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,710
have a 30 day grace period this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

513
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:12,120
waited at most about a week but and the

514
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:15,550
second time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so if</font>

515
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,080
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at who's involved from a</font>

516
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,990
stakeholder perspective the researcher

517
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,879
obviously if this was a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> outcome</font>

518
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,180
probably would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone public and said</font>

519
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,890
who they were they did they're anonymous

520
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,230
so from an integrity perspective they're

521
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,370
not saying what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing and why</font>

522
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,750
they're doing it they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

523
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,320
credit for it they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

524
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:38,800
transparent maybe for personal safety

525
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,780
reasons who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows programmers want to do</font>

526
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing but they're told what to</font>

527
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:47,160
do by the people who pay them and the

528
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:50,460
vendor they have their reputation online

529
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:53,740
they may lose resources or lose revenue

530
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,620
because people don't buy this the

531
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,770
service providers have customers the

532
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:04,389
customers or have clients those clients

533
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:05,650
have customers so be a cert they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

534
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea that this was going to be announced</font>

535
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:12,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">they weren't prepared for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as you go</font>

536
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,270
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the criminals who</font>

537
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:18,490
find this information in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case what</font>

538
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:22,330
good do you get from destroying 100,000

539
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:24,390
website not very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if there is</font>

540
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,980
some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a vulnerability where</font>

541
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:30,070
now you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to go steal</font>

542
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,950
credit cards or whatever art bleed or

543
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,269
something like that now they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

544
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,909
act on whatever it is they're

545
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:41,200
and so there's this<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeframe that you</font>

546
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:43,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to take into consideration let's</font>

547
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,700
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go through another use case here</font>

548
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,789
to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of understand how you guys</font>

549
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,200
always fit into this people are saying

550
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:51,729
that they want to take down criminal

551
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,139
botnets because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the</font>

552
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:57,759
equation they want to increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost</font>

553
00:24:53,139 --> 00:25:00,939
deter people from breaking in and this

554
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:04,619
box in the bottom left here people who

555
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,619
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing research into Kelly ozbilici</font>

556
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:16,570
I was followed on by Kelly oz and the

557
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:19,509
red lines here show the family that's in

558
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:23,259
the bottom left so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of</font>

559
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:26,709
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in January 2010 when Microsoft did</font>

00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:29,019
the first civil legal TR<font color="#CCCCCC"> o every</font>

00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:35,649
of domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> or wall attack that caused</font>

563
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:37,929
the botnet to kind of go offline and not

564
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:40,958
much activity for about 10 months but

565
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,929
subsequent to that the next takedown was

566
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:47,619
again Microsoft and some others

567
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:50,709
following that a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies and</font>

568
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:52,718
the honey nut project took it down in

569
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:55,299
2012 it was then taken down how many

570
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">people here saw or heard of the Kelly</font>

571
00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:02,168
else take down at RSA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 23rd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

572
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,779
they'd alive take down on stage so you

573
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:06,549
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the bottom right in both of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">those cases the botnet was back up and</font>

575
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:13,709
running within hours and has basically

576
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:15,959
been continually active since 2011 so

577
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:19,419
just really quickly back-of-the-envelope

578
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:22,570

back so fast is after this one take down

593
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,850
i went back and just started looking

with some basic facts doing searches

you be considering them in terms of risk

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,940
and benefit for whatever this action it

643
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,460
and then afterwards

644

you what happens to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you</font>

their authority not ours so if you can

648
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,100
try to involve them to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal</font>

649
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,350
attempt that's what everybody seems to

650
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,519
agree is the best outcome get people to

651
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,009
stop because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're afraid they're</font>

652
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:27,200
going to go to jail so at the extreme

653
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:29,240
end of this active response continuum

654
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,870
where you might be potentially harming

655
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:36,889
people try to do it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way that is the</font>

656
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:40,309
least damaging and if you use civil or

657
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:43,059
criminal legal process primarily rather

658
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:45,379
than just technical means unilaterally

659
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:48,379
you'll get some better outcomes and

660
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:50,418
following this virtue ethics being able

661
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:53,389
to explain what you're doing beforehand

662
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:55,759
and after the fact and justifying it in

663
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:59,330
the right way that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe is</font>

664
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:01,220
the way to go so here's the interactive

665
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,480
time I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and get it much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

666
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,789
discussion going on as possible so a

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,710
large number of you weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really aware</font>

668
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:11,809
of some of these button and takedowns

669
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:15,950
that have been going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down many of which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">had some impact to the people whose</font>

guys and gals how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think your</font>

00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,080
you just be considered by whoever is

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,809
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be planning on doing something</font>

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">or should you be actively involved in</font>

00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:42,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">some way should you be engaged in trying</font>

to minimize the harm and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

680
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:51,279
the outcome be and what influence do you

think you guys have what<font color="#E5E5E5"> limits you is</font>

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything legally or actually or</font>

683
00:30:55,179 --> 00:31:01,100
resource wide that prevents you<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

684
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,500
being involved and how should<font color="#E5E5E5"> you be</font>

685
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,019
actually your organization be expressing

686
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,139
its concerned about the really risky

687
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:12,649
thing you want a disinfect computer want

688
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:15,469
to make manic control away<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

689
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:17,658
situation where it might mean that

690
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,360
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers computers go offline for</font>

691
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:23,900
some reason at a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nobody knows</font>

692
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,199
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not involved how should</font>

693
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,200
that go

694
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">alexandra lemon I don't care either</font>

695
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">loves the question is the size of</font>

696
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:46,170
collateral damage how much unaware

697
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:49,240
people will be affected along with

698
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:53,650
hardware and software is that assisted

699
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,400
by malware that's I think the main part

700
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,770
of the equation at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in my opinion</font>

701
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:05,590
ok so the collateral damage art is one

702
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:07,000
of the bigger concerns how if somebody's

703
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:11,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be trying to take some action</font>

704
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,770
and let's say you're taking domains away

705
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,660
how do you figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out where this</font>

706
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,150
collateral damage will be and how do we

707
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,500
minimize it that's that's we're trying

708
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see a</font>

709
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:27,270
good way come in answer this question

710
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:30,460
just to see you do no question it's just

711
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:34,420
if you have to be considerate on a

712
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:38,260
case-by-case basis and if it's just some

713
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:40,690
new domain names that just arrived few

714
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:43,480
minutes ago so registry to control this

715
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:48,580
but net that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and if you have</font>

716
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:51,940
some sort level domain and if you bring

717
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:54,189
down the third level domain along with

718
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:58,060
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> good customers that's a whole other</font>

719
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:00,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said collateral damage big</font>

722
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:10,540
there is some victim users victimized to

723
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:13,060
users objectives and of course some

724
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:15,970
notifications through<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network</font>

725
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:20,560
providers and IT services providers

726
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:24,070
should be in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so how many</font>

727
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">people here from DNS providers or</font>

728
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:32,139
entities that are involved with DNS how

729
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,000
many believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any kind of an action</font>

against<font color="#E5E5E5"> those domains without your</font>

731
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,430
cooperation should not happen the

temporary restraining order kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

733
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:46,770
thing anybody or there's somebody in the

734
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,770
back here

735
00:33:49,640 --> 00:34:02,429
question in the back yeah Andrew<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alston</font>

736
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:05,179
from liquid<font color="#E5E5E5"> telecom I've got a bit of an</font>

737
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting perspective on this because</font>

738
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:09,540
one of the questions up there is what

739
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,389
limits the organization's ability to be

740
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:15,810
actively involved now where I come from

741
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:19,260
I can't take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a legal route because there</font>

742
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:21,299
is no legal route to be followed and we

743
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,609
sit in a situation I mean I'm based in

744
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,240
Kenya we operate in 13 countries across

745
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:29,790
Africa there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are no cyber crime units</font>

746
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,888
there I can go to the police i can say i

747
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,149
found this guy my network and he's

748
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:35,450
attacking half the world and they're

749
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:39,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go so what what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean</font>

750
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:42,509
so that is a hugely limiting factor and

751
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,729
as the bandwidth grows in an area like

752
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:47,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">africa it becomes far more of a threat</font>

753
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,560
to the rest of the world so it puts us

754
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,989
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult position when I've</font>

755
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,359
got an<font color="#E5E5E5"> American company coming and</font>

756
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:56,459
saying we're being attacked but at the

757
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">same time what can I actually do about</font>

758
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,910
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> without taking an active approach</font>

759
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:06,540
because the criminal and the civil

760
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:09,720
penalties they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't exist so I</font>

761
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,400
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also becomes a lot of there's a</font>

762
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,459
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of lobbying that needs to be done</font>

763
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,160
there to increase the law enforcement

764
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,280
side of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give us further</font>

765
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,700
options and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the</font>

766
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:27,119
time but it is a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge that</font>

767
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,220
we're facing currently and particularly

768
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,859
because we are starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see more and</font>

769
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,990
more attacks flowing out of Africa to

770
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:36,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the world there was an</font>

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nairobi caught fire and when the police</font>

773
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,280
showed up there they found 77 Chinese

774
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,470
citizens in there complete with loads

775
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,890
and loads of high-tech equipment doing

776
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:52,470
goodness knows what they arrested the

777
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,810
lot of them and a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> days later</font>

778
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,419
the Chinese came and said please extra

779
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,060
light these guys we want our guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

780
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,470
draw your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own conclusions</font>

781
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:05,549
what do you do in a situation like that

782
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:08,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm I don't know anymore can I ask then</font>

783
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:14,190
how much engagement is your company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

784
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:18,299
other companies have with the basically

785
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:21,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sovereigns in africa vs other</font>

786
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:24,420
entities to try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> those sovereigns</font>

787
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:27,480
to do something is law is<font color="#CCCCCC"> passed only if</font>

788
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,940
there's enough pressure we are engaging

789
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,320
pretty constantly with various

790
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:36,090
governments about the issues and where

791
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,520
we can and we do get complaints

792
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,650
obviously we shut down what we can while

793
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,230
engagement in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the law enforcement</font>

794
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">community we do get requests</font>

795
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:51,540
particularly in areas like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kenya from</font>

796
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,250
anti-terrorism units and we cooperate as

797
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,259
much as possible while trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

the point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be able to help</font>

799
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,060
them form with there are better laws but

800
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,580
it's proving to be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very slow</font>

801
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,920
process and my concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the</font>

802
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,740
capacity to launch attacks from Africa

803
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,530
is growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall faster than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability</font>

804
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,410
to actually do something about

805
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybercrime there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow up</font>

806
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:20,609
before you go away what could this

807
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:24,359
community or others do outside of your

808
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:27,330
direct corporate sector to try to help

809
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,040
influence that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as they were</font>

810
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:32,880
there are various government working

811
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,790
groups within within Africa particularly

812
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,850
i know that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> afrinic has a lot</font>

813
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,980
of government working groups etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

814
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,960
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very helpful to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

815
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,360
international<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence of those saying</font>

816
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,190
these are the effects of attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

817
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,990
are seeing and you need to do something

818
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it because we need some external</font>

819
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,799
pressure as well as the internal

820
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,600
pressure to come down on the

821
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,400
government's etc of<font color="#CCCCCC"> africa to do</font>

822
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:00,150
something about it because if it's

823
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:06,210
purely internal it you get for this

824
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:08,820
reaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay excellent right I'm that's</font>

825
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:12,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow-up to previous speaker</font>

826
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:17,340
the question comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mind as let's say</font>

827
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:21,330
active mitigation or active retaliation

828
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:24,390
I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from couple of winners few</font>

829
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:26,790
times but this year that they've been

830
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit by amplification attack and if it's</font>

831
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:35,210
not stops in next 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours they will</font>

832
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:37,110
start actively suppress servers that are

833
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,960
initiating the second stage of

834
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:42,420
amplification attack and how good is

835
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,210
that I mean this will only make<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

836
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,320
worse as well only cause more outages

837
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:52,100
all over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is that acceptable</font>

838
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:55,260
why people have in the strange ideas

839
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:58,950
what's a community opinion on this I

840
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:04,100
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's by doing the bad things</font>

841
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:06,930
you're becoming a bad guy right so

842
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:10,220
specifically some of the attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> against</font>

843
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:13,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the financial sector a year or so ago</font>

844
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:16,020
those kinds of dos attacks where an

845
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:18,330
entity has sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an existential threat</font>

846
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,560
to their a business model<font color="#E5E5E5"> if their web</font>

847
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">front-end doesn't work and you have</font>

848
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:27,090
sometimes hundreds of thousands millions

849
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:29,640
of devices used for reflection in those

850
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,440
kinds of searching circumstances there

851
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,339
is pressure by the people who are the

852
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">victim to stop it what's the alternative</font>

853
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:43,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue so how is that it multiplies</font>

854
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,920
the collateral damage as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said by order</font>

855
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:48,839
of magnitude and it's it's that's just

856
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,570
considered that it's not an option no

857
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:54,170
matter how bad you heat no matter what

858
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:57,420
your lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tsar is just not an option</font>

859
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:59,550
retaliation is not an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

860
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,770
then if there was a group that was doing

861
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:06,780
review after action review of these

862
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">kinds of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things what kind of momentum</font>

863
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:12,660
could that group have in not naming and

864
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,399
shaming directly but just making<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

865
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:18,170
really clear that the collateral damage

866
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,970
issue should take some precedent over

867
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,119

solutions and they involve

880
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:56,529
over-provisioning or having a provider

in place to mitigate after you are

Michael Thompson Argonne National Labs I

894
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:34,720
think it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting problem</font>

895
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,220
area we've been looking at doing some

896
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,578
laboratory experiments in this direction

897
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:41,799
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that and this is just my</font>

898
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:43,450
personal opinion but I think we've been

899
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:45,779
sort of blessed and lucky that the

internet is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still kind of this wild-west</font>

901
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:52,119
sort of attitude and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us who</font>

902
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:55,450
come from sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Operations</font>

903
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:57,279
background you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we like that but the</font>

904
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:59,769
real truth is that even in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> states</font>

905
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:02,950
the government and law enforcement don't

906
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:07,899
have the either ability or resources or

907
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:09,970
technical ability to step in and do

908
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,069
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a large amount of these</font>

909
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,319
threats so we have companies like

00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:16,230
Microsoft stepping in and doing it you

911

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them going rogue essentially</font>

912
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,980
and I think you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this community and</font>

913
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:24,220
other communities that have the ability

some ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know that i don't know</font>

916
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,180
that i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say that we have a</font>

917

responsibility but if if we don't step

918
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,779
in and take leadership on this issue and

919

921
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:40,538
forever governments are going to step in

00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:44,740
and do it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and we're probably not</font>

going to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results so just again</font>

924
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,549
sort of my opinion I think you know as

00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:51,009
much as possible those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in</font>

926
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:53,140
leadership positions need to step in and

927
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:56,230
start making policy and start trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

928
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,720
influence the legal system to you know

929
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:01,150
take a more proactive view of this in a

930
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,250
way that technically makes sense instead

931
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:07,299
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know letting lawmakers do it you</font>

933
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:12,819
before you sit down can you or are you

934
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,578
aware of efforts within your

935
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:18,880
organization or peers since you're a

936
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:21,069
national lab but maybe not be the best

937
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,670
set of are you aware of efforts to try

I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not aware of any efforts to that</font>

949
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:59,439
effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah just to comment on what the</font>

950
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:03,549
previous speaker was saying about how

951
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:07,720
governments react when other people

952
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:10,960
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> react I had a situation little</font>

953
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:13,990
while back where we had a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

954
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,190
network and the counterterrorism unit

955
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:20,258
showed up at my door and they said well

956
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,450
you guys haven't done anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

957
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:23,559
because at that point we actually

958
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:26,470
couldn't because of contractual

959
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:27,789
obligations so they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> well now we are</font>

960
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,649
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to and I said have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

961
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:31,569
court order they said no we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

962
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:33,970
court order but you've got a choice you

963
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:36,549
either do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it or we'll</font>

964
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:38,919
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take you away to jail and there you</font>

965
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:43,089
will sit for who knows how long and

966
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:46,930
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> due process so yes governments</font>

967
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:49,850
can be a little bit nasty if you don't

968
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,799
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>

969
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:53,600
do something they can get really really

970
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,870
nasty<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean that's an extreme case</font>

971
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,900
but it's becoming more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more like</font>

972
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:02,480
that by the day particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our area</font>

973
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the world interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

974
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last question here yeah</font>

975
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,120
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick note actually to Michael's</font>

976
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,500
comment about the government being

977
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,180
involved we also have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful</font>

978
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">because there's a you know the Internet</font>

979
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,529
is international thing and a lot of

980
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,960
those who happen across a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

981
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,360
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> jurisdictions and having a</font>

982
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,790
particular government involved may also

983
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,800
look like this government in being is

984
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:29,300
being biased to achieve particular goals

985
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,950
so may also be good to consider a

986
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,970
completely non government based

987
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:36,799
organization or approach to this again

988
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:38,600
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legal system but not</font>

989
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,610
sponsored in particular by the

990
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:48,410
government of any country for that

991
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:55,940
matter yeah all right could this be the

992
00:45:48,410 --> 00:46:01,129
end timekeeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so just in conclusion</font>

993
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:04,340
here as crazy was just eluding having a

994
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:07,970
group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-governmental trying</font>

995
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:10,390
to do some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and several speakers</font>

996
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:12,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">here I'm hearing the same thing that</font>

997
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:14,839
there needs to be active engagement

998
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,520
there needs to be some pressure put on

999
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,450
governments to do the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1000
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:22,780
necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve legal capacity</font>

1001
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:26,089
improve laws and prove policies but also

1002
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,260
doing things in a way that works with

1003
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,320
the fact that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is</font>

1004
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,900
international so I'd encourage anybody

1005
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,090
else somebody said they were going to

1006
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up with me later I'll hang out here</font>

1007
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:38,750
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little while if anybody wants to</font>

1008
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,450
follow up on this discussion if want to

1009
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:44,270
be involved in this I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact</font>

1010
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,740
