1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,020
Oh

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,919
thank you let's figure out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,170
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,470
I want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you guys about the</font>

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,110
analog ring what it is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font>

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,660
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second half of the talk is</font>

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,910
about a recent feature we introduced

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,189
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I consider one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most awesome</font>

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:35,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we've done on the ring project in</font>

10
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:38,230
the last few years the metaphysical

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,350
definition of the ring is in essence

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,269
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a network debugging platform</font>

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,750
operated by network operators designed

14
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:49,839
for network operators like yourself the

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,170
foundation is based on trust you provide

16
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:55,659
a machine with access to others and then

17
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:01,780
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to machines that other</font>

18
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:04,120
people made available as well and so far

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,799
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people have already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> joined can</font>

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,049
I see a show of hands of people that

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:12,520
currently have a ring notes yes Kate

22
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:14,320
very good so I see a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,210
did not raise their hands we need to

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,089
maybe work on that and i hope this talk

25
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:23,798
will convince you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join the project</font>

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:27,520
keep in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's free the analog ring</font>

27
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:32,170
started in 2010 when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friend of mine</font>

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,420
had a weird issue from certain source IP

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,500
addresses to certain destination IP

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,929
addresses packets didn't pass through a

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,630
certain internet exchange and he was

32
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:46,840
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to nail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down where the issue lay</font>

33
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,658
exactly so he would call people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask</font>

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,450
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do ping sweeps he asked people</font>

35
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:55,630
in IRC to do trade routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for him and</font>

36
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,520
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this debugging information was</font>

37
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,619
gathered<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an asynchronous way and it</font>

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,439
consumes an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you</font>

39
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,990
probably recognize the scenario where

40
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,818
you a customer tells you i have a

41
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,318
certain issue you ask them for a trace

42
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,990
route and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide you the trace</font>

43
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,609
route without any time stamp or even

44
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,560
better they put a screen shot of the

45
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">trace rail in a word document and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> evil</font>

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,100
that's you so the ring addresses this

47
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,110
type of issues because we all know

48
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,980
debugging networks is not trivial and

49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,360
the ring helps in that regard current

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">state of the ring is</font>

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,180
that there are almost 300 organizations

52
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,640
participating with as much notes spread

53
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:41,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">over 50 countries or so so there's a</font>

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">gigantic amount of diversity to assess</font>

gigantic amount of diversity in the ring

will make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to query DNS</font>

65
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,709

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,739
trade routes from an insane amount of

67
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:22,870
notes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do MTU testing for both v4</font>

and v6 port scanning and debugging load

69

balancing issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the ring</font>

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,680
originally started with and now let's

71
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,720
cover the new ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> sq a tool that I'm</font>

72
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">very excited about ring sqa is a tool to</font>

73
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,040
very fast detect partial outages in your

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,930
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have some monitoring</font>

75
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,570
boxes outside your network but they only

76
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,790
monitor from a single location and if

77
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,130
the path between that location and your

78
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,150
network is functional then you will not

79
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,820
see outages hundred percent outages are

80
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,940
very easy to detect your mother will

81
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,140
call you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I cannot check my email</font>

82
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,480
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wrong with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

83
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that's easy but what if you can</font>

84
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,030
only not reach say two or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three percent</font>

85
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,518
of the routing table that's much harder

86
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:20,950
to detect and that's what ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> ska will</font>

87
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:25,060
help you do the process is simple ring

88
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,909
ska will detect a issue and we'll cover

89
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,520
how it detects issues later it will

90
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,310
collect data for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your immediate</font>

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,830
consumption so you have actual debugging

92
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,539
information when the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> was occurring</font>

93
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,400
so you don't have a trace route that's

94
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:43,820
hours after the events

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">trace routes during the events and then</font>

96
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,009
an alarm is emitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we have various</font>

97
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,320
output plugins you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either get it</font>

98
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:53,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">through email or UDP packets which</font>

99
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,729
contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the debugging information or</font>

100
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:01,130
you can launch a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell shell script which</font>

101
00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:04,789
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> API calls or opens a ticket the</font>

102
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:07,850
detection part every ring note runs the

103
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:11,630
SQ a demon and what it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> every 30</font>

104
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,699
seconds it will probe all other nodes to

105
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,169
test for reach ability it does so both

106
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:20,539
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> 34 and 36</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and from this constant</font>

107
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:24,310
probing of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes that are in the</font>

108
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:27,260
ring it derives a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of baseline</font>

109
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,449
because at any given moment there are

110
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,210
written notes that are unreachable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

111
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:35,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">our rebooting or something is going on</font>

112
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,330
so it's kind of natural to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sort</font>

113
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of noise in unreachable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tea but what's</font>

114
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,159
not natural if suddenly there is an

115
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,729
increase in the amount of notes that are

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:50,240
unreachable and ring sqa is designed to

117
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:52,909
detect these spikes of unreality so

118
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,260
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> free mate and 30 seconds it probes</font>

119
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:59,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">notes it creates a baseline and if the</font>

higher than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous 27 minutes it</font>

122
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,930
will conclude that something is wrong

00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:10,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">with your network and this is to</font>

catching the point where something broke

exact time stamp at when it occurred and

153
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:52,060
a list of notes that were previously

154
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:55,090
reachable but not anymore so in the

can very easily enable alerting today

actually use sqa alerts at ntt for

we see often or it's a local problem

212

where for instance the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of racks</font>

serious so 40 false positives<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

218
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:20,950
means that you should put a ring note in

219
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,580
your major locations because ring SQ

220
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:27,340
a will monitor the the network from its

221
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,760
own vantage points so if you have a few

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:33,160

224
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,969

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:43,710
the routing table of course about the

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:50,200
volunteers there's no money involved

228
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:54,160
there is a non-profit<font color="#CCCCCC"> foundation there</font>

229
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,940
is the legal entity behind us the tools

230
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,189
come from ring participants themselves

231
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:04,570
so the ring s great tool has been

<font color="#E5E5E5">threatened by it is a coup or sacro ET</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

234
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:15,520
TDC and and you can write software as

235
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:17,890
well if you're interested this is the

236
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,720
the way the ring evolves it's by active

237
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:25,000
participation from the participants

238
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,920
themselves you can join very easily just

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,670
fill in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application form on our</font>

240
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,890
website the requirements are simple you

241
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,280
provide a virtual machine with one IP

242
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:40,290
four and one ipv6 address with at least

243
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,000
512 megabytes of ram and a 20 gig disk

244
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,579
you have to put ubuntu on it because

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,710
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we standardized and you</font>

246
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,600
have to have an AS number that is

247
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">present in the default free zone because</font>

248
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,600
it's for network operators and and

249
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,700
that's it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to join and as</font>

250
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">I said nobody else can offer you this</font>

251
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:09,400
for free yep that's my last slide are

252
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:12,030
there questions about ring sqa or the

253
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,030
ring in general

254
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,339
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working oh it's working</font>

255
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:30,670
Alexandra Limon speaking are two

256
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:34,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions first scaling how how well</font>

257
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:39,610
your instrument scales how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes</font>

258
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accept any estimates currently our</font>

259
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:46,180
growth rate is roughly one participant

260
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:50,140
per week and I see<font color="#CCCCCC"> no reason why that</font>

261
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">would suddenly go up because we've been</font>

262
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:57,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">operating for four years now and this is</font>

263
00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:00,250
apparently how fast we grow so at 50

264
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,469
notes per year it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still very easy to</font>

265
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,430
do any to any probing it's it's it's not

266
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:08,770
an issue and secondly is security

267
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,650
external and internal internal is if not

268
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:15,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nodes cover will cooperate</font>

269
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:17,680
and some examples ended by the

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">information somehow Mohammed information</font>

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,349
and the other is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pitching for</font>

272
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,060
the whole system works because you put

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,070
in something new<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

274
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:31,689
you're not completely control good point

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,230
from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security point of view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd few a</font>

ring node as a like a dedicated server

277
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,790
you sold to a customer the difference

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,410
ring notes but security wise it's just a

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a third party elements in your</font>

protect your internal stuff so the ring

288
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,510
node can never query your internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's</font>

289
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:15,339
but other than that just considered a

290
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:18,370
customer so far in four years we have

291
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:21,820
not had a single case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of abuse of the</font>

292
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:24,420
ring and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do warn people if you abuse</font>

293
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,820
the ring i will name in shame you and

294
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,949
that might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty but so far this</font>

295
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,400
system of trust seems to work for years

296
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">without incidents and I I don't see why</font>

297
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,120
we would not trust each<font color="#CCCCCC"> other's as</font>

298
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,000
adults

299
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,130
instead answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question it's more</font>

300
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,720
inviting the trouble is it asking my

301
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:48,720
question thank you any other questions

302
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,070
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to the mic</font>

303
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,839
my name is Maura from University of

304
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,889
Colorado Boulder I just have a question

305
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:13,720
how easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate new matrix to your</font>

306
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:15,730
terrain like if I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do like new</font>

307
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,559
tests and new measurements is it easy

308
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:23,559
for outsider to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are two</font>

309
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:26,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways to run tests the first one is you</font>

310
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:29,738
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like ansible or an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssh</font>

311
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:34,949
multiplexer to run your<font color="#CCCCCC"> scripts on all</font>

312
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:34,949
nodes shoot your measurements be of

313
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:40,569
sufficient generic interest to ring

314
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:42,549
participants I would take your

315
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:45,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">measurement software package it and then</font>

316
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:47,939
distributed to all notes from our

317
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:50,889
configuration management system so

318
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:52,779
either you make a general purpose tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

319
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:55,089
will package it as part of our

320
00:16:52,779 --> 00:17:04,539
distribution or you just run it through

321
00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:07,720
ssh yourself right thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you no more</font>
