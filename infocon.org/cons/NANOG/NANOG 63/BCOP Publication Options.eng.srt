less talking this

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,670
is with Kathy Aronson who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,740
talking about best current operational

00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:24,759
this is and how to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them in the</font>

RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> breasts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I always seems like a good</font>

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:33,730
idea till I'm up here um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I got</font>

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent on this journey by Aaron Hughes</font>

8
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,180
thanks Aaron I know a lot more about

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,500
intellectual property now than I cared

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,410
to ever know he asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me since I go to I</font>

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,170
ATF if I would look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into whether it</font>

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,970
would be possible to publish the nog

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,120
various<font color="#CCCCCC"> nogs be cop documents through</font>

14
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,010
the IETF document stream since it exists

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,919
and it's stable and there's somebody who

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,930
edits it and all that good stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when</font>

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,790
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to the IETF in november i met</font>

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,290
with heather<font color="#E5E5E5"> flanagan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's fabulous if</font>

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,710
you don't know where you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet her</font>

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,500
it was great and we talked in depth

21
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:12,460
about how this would be possible so here

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">i am don't kill</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the messenger okay so</font>

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,630
according to<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd really like</font>

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,719
to hear if there are other requirements

25
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,939
from you guys that requirements for this

26
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,189
from this community buzz would be that

27
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,889
of course operators wouldn't want to go

28
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:29,648
to an ietf and participate so it would

29
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,670
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in lieu of that although it</font>

30
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:33,579
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great if you want and</font>

31
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,170
participated the documents must be

32
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">available in multiple languages because</font>

33
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,189
there's multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> nogs in multiple</font>

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,530
regions and we'll talk about that's more

35
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:43,750
and if there are others<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd really like</font>

36
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,119
to hear what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that's my short</font>

37
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:50,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">list that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started with when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I went on</font>

38
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,539
this journey so for you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,240
publishing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cops there are two</font>

40
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:57,670
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> two options the first option</font>

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,789
is to publish them as independent

42
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,100
submissions the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> option is to</font>

43
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:05,979
publish them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the operations area and</font>

44
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,689
we'll talk about both of those the

45
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">really good news about all of this is</font>

46
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,220
that there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> any funding required</font>

47
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,410
from this Community to do either of

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,010
those the only funding would be required

49
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do translations so if and I would</font>

50
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,329
imagine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if another nog in another</font>

51
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,250
country publishes in another language

52
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,540
they'd have to be translated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to English</font>

53
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,120
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could go through this</font>

54
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">process which wouldn't be a bad thing</font>

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,210
anyway

56
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,890
and of course they could be translated

57
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,080
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other direction from English to</font>

58
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,958
other languages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that wouldn't be</font>

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,650
required but you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF review</font>

60
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,010
process all happens in English so

61
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,440
independent submissions like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the</font>

62
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,329
them to go through the IETF track they

63
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,829
need to be in English but they could

64
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,760
start out in whatever language you

65
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,620
wanted and if they were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,310
translated there would be money required

67
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,430
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then the independent submission</font>

68
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,040
stream so the documents aren't actually

69
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,260
put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the IETF process so you</font>

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,850
you as a community would come up with

71
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the boilerplate that would go with the</font>

72
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,870
document every document that says this

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,549
is how its produced this is where it's

74
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,290
produced this is who you talk to and

75
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,500
will tell I'll give you an I'll show you

76
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,290
an example of that on my next slide the

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,060
iesg review process is only to make sure

78
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,370
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

79
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,459
conflict with existing IETF work and

80
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,190
then the RFC editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> also just you know</font>

81
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,910
reads it and edits it which she<font color="#E5E5E5"> did to</font>

82
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:39,269
my slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> even which was really pretty</font>

83
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,829
helpful my grandma<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lot better if</font>

84
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,090
you got if any of you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be at</font>

85
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:46,920
apricot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March Heather will also be</font>

86
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:50,340
presenting this similar presentation

87
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,018
because the our beds folks are looking

88
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">at doing the same sort of thing with</font>

89
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,100
their documents and they're still in a

90
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,989
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode about whether to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font>

91
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,190
an independent submission or as we'll

92
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,380
talk about the regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC process so</font>

93
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,420
the boilerplate that would go into an

94
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,280
independent submission this is an

95
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't i won't</font>

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,180
belabor the point but basically it talks

97
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,079
there's a link to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it talks about</font>

98
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,239
how the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> is produced in a little</font>

99
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,019
bit of detail and where it came from and

100
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:25,560
all that sort of stuff so if you were to

101
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">create an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> op documents in the operations</font>

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,630
area which i think is probably the best

103
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:34,320
way to go you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually have to</font>

104
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,300
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a meeting at an ietf meeting be a</font>

105
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group that meets completely at</font>

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,530
network operators groups doesn't have to

107
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,960
meet in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ietf which I didn't know when</font>

108
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,369
I started this

109
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,560
all journey of mine although and i think

110
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the if they were published</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

111
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,030
operations area<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that there'd be</font>

112
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,220
a lot more cross-pollination between the

113
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,789
operations at EF and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operation of</font>

114
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,680
you guys the other question about the

115
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:02,659
just to step back a second the

116
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,900
independent submission track is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

117
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is d determines that what</font>

118
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,739
you're writing conflicts was something

119
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,479
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in the IETF then it's no</font>

120
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,389
longer an independent submission and

121
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,550
ends up in this process anyway and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

122
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">not entirely sure how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

123
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">would happen I know you have dull here</font>

124
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,810
he's an ad he might he might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

125
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,099
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's familiar with</font>

126
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:32,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cops and familiar with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF um</font>

127
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:34,880
anyway let's see the IETF standard

128
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,889
operations stream would also require a

129
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,930
lot more review the standard review

130
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:42,220
process and lost all and stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes</font>

131
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,050
through regular IETF RFC s so more

132
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,060
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reading the documents and</font>

133
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,039
possibly it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> take more time to</font>

134
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,560
reach consensus though there's good

135
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,270
points and bad points to the operations

136
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,940
area of art<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is super fun</font>

137
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,590
stuff intellectual property

138
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,320
consideration so there's a bunch of

139
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,090
links in here and I probably won't go

140
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,710
into a lot of it but the ITF trust gets

141
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,090
certain rights with these documents and

142
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:16,520
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that has to do with the fact</font>

143
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:18,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some you know the RFC stream you</font>

144
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,960
know are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

145
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:23,810
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the document generate a new</font>

146
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,698
document and spit out a new version and

147
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,789
in order to do that you have to have

148
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:34,430
rights copyright rights and rights to

149
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">edit and all that derivative works and</font>

150
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,440
all that sort of stuff so there's a lot

151
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Rights that these documents would get</font>

152
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,419
the the trust would get for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

153
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:49,260
documents this is a little blurb about

154
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:55,479
it what the IETF would get

155
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:59,890
licenses and stuff for the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,740
so it as an independent submission a

157
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,890
document could only be informational or

158
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,740
experimental not a regular RFC or even a

159
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,289
best current a best common practice RFC

160
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,930
which you know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of good</font>

161
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:18,160
if the nanog documents were best common

162
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:21,430
practices on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet standard scale</font>

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,070
that might be interesting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless</font>

164
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">derivative works so derivative work is</font>

165
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,780
like if you take a photograph when you

166
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,789
make a painting or you take an RFC you

167
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,640
take some of the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make a new</font>

168
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,550
RFC that has new content new

169
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">copyrightable content but it's got some</font>

170
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,060
of the original content that would be a

171
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:45,159
derivative work there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain rules</font>

172
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,730
they can be created outside of the IETF

173
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,850
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> were a FATA RFC and the regular</font>

174
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:56,050
process it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be within the</font>

175
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:59,290
IETF process the<font color="#E5E5E5"> independent submissions</font>

176
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,900
editor will ask reviewers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> review it</font>

177
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:05,860
make sure it's saying or whatever they

178
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,929
consider to be saying and again to make

179
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure it doesn't have end runs around the</font>

180
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,270
regular IETF process if you're writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

181
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,550
best current practice that also happens

182
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,530
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ops working group for some</font>

183
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,780
reason then then there's a conflict

184
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,580
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it not</font>

185
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:26,549
be an independent submission like I said

186
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:29,770
before if a best current practice

187
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:33,130
becomes an RFC via the regular process

188
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:35,079
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be any kind of any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of RFC it</font>

189
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,830
can be standard track at the best common

190
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,660
practice experimental and be any of them

191
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,910
and like I said derivative works in this

192
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,860
case would happen within the IETF

193
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,930
process and there's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny thing</font>

194
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,880
happening right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the IETF</font>

195
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,520
process they have templates and some of

196
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,990
their rfcs and to fill out the template

197
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,670
like if you printed it and filled it out

198
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,290
at your house you created a derivative

199
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,219
work and right now you can't actually do

200
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font>

201
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,540
so they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing some of the</font>

202
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,100
process to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could</font>

203
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually use the template and maybe</font>

204
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,569
modify the template and and that sort of

205
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,189
thing which I so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

206
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:11,019
best current practices have templates

207
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:15,399
but that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font>

208
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:17,860
and put in put in and then in this case

209
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,870
if it's a regular working group process

210
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,509
again you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet in an ietf</font>

211
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,029
to do this the full IETF community the

212
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:27,100
regular process of vetting of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

213
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,959
document would occur as opposed to an

214
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,800
independent submit submission which it

215
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:36,609
has a different process i will be

216
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,258
talking really fast so again the

217
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,519
independent submission stream allows

218
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:44,500
your different kinds of documents and

219
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,110
the derivative works are slightly

220
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,209
different rules most of the common mo

221
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,069
actually the most common derivative work

222
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:54,250
is translation that would also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

223
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:59,110
derivative work and the review process

224
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,850
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really different so let's see so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

225
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,360
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is going really fast but</font>

226
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:07,149
that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steps</font>

227
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,829
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you all to decide what you</font>

228
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,139
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do with the documents</font>

229
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:14,019
if this is the right path and then

230
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:17,500
Heather is super helpful and certainly

231
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:20,860
available to help guide everyone through

232
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,529
the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all happen and</font>

233
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,079
then she helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> me update this along</font>

234
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,689
with editing my grammar the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

235
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,059
document here is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> copyright back it</font>

236
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:33,639
talks about all the rules with the IETF

237
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:35,769
trust and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in English and</font>

238
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,860
not in legalese I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

239
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:40,629
helpful and then all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of them</font>

240
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,589
there's links to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different rfcs</font>

241
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:48,309
that control this process and all that

242
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:50,410
sort of stuff let's see anyway does

243
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:52,449
anybody have comments or questions I

244
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:58,629
know aren't really fast but it isn't

245
00:10:52,449 --> 00:11:00,849
super technical at all hi mrs. Shawn

246
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:02,740
Turner back here in the back oh there

247
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,800
you are there there is a third option um

248
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,899
you could get your own stream oh sure

249
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,569
but I was asked to look into this

250
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,920
process just as<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so for me that</font>

251
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,240
the thing is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the option is</font>

252
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,939
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through the ISC which is</font>

253
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,830
a lot easier so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had like you know</font>

254
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,230
the title<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NaN augs be</font>

255
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,730
slopped title and then just call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

256
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">quits that's really the easiest thing to</font>

257
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,040
do if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get cross</font>

258
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">pollination then you go through the</font>

259
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">other approach which is it go through</font>

260
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,650
ops because then you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

261
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">more eyes on it right but these are the</font>

262
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,709
time een I don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that's a</font>

263
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,180
third option because according to

264
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">heather these duties so that so the</font>

265
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,540
third option is to actually get a new

266
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,150
stream there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> RCT defines four</font>

267
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,079
streams one for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRT f1 for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf</font>

268
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:46,180
one for the i/o and just get your own

269
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,380
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an</font>

270
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:52,689
option but we could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it or am I</font>

271
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:56,680
I think Joel was neck yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy a glee</font>

272
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">wow what I is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G members up here um and</font>

273
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,719
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard my name invoked it</font>

274
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,820
means an earlier so yeah well it's it's

275
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:10,120
probably worse for you than it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for me</font>

276
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:12,280
but I i mean i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was asked about</font>

277
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,900
this fairly early and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the</font>

278
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,130
important thing for documents dreams

279
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:20,170
whether it's here or a ripe is sort of

280
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,000
how we measure their utility and I think

281
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,620
the gravitas comes from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quality of</font>

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,970
the information in them and not who

283
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,620
publishes them and so I don't think

284
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,290
there's a problem per se with using the

285
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISC to publish documents it's relatively</font>

286
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,760
straightforward and the review process

287
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,560
is basically the independent stream

288
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,090
editor makes their own decision which is

289
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,729
theirs alone to make and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they asked</font>

290
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:47,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg if it's harmful and we say yay</font>

291
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,850
or nay and there's some ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

292
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,790
slice that a little bit but we don't

293
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,720
actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more oversight than</font>

294
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,699
that into the process um<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF coming</font>

295
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,380
together as a community and saying they

296
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,570
have consensus on something is a

297
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:05,500
different kind of activity and that is

298
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:09,300
that is done with individual submissions

299
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:12,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've actually personally sponsored ad or</font>

300
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,050
drafts that individuals have brought to

301
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:18,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the IETF and carried them all the way</font>

302
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,449
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process and um I think from</font>

303
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the vantage point of some of those</font>

304
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,990
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more trouble</font>

305
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,340
than it was worth but some of them are

306
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:29,220
very

307
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:32,400
obstinate so I mean that is definitely a

308
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,110
possibility um it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the</font>

309
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,160
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> order of priority for getting</font>

310
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,870
information out there though so when we

311
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,150
come together as a community and we come

312
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,940
together as a working group whether it's

313
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,430
in operations and management or routing

314
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,500
or whatever I think we do better work

315
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,390
around the consensus process than we do

316
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,090
with individual submissions but it's

317
00:13:51,390 --> 00:14:04,710
also a higher bar so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth</font>

318
00:13:54,090 --> 00:14:07,020
it I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's good so I'm</font>

319
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,810
Spencer Dawkins and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joel just set me up</font>

320
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,910
perfectly I think so so one of the

321
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,729
questions that I was wondering about I

322
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,969
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for investigating this</font>

323
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to thank name nana for poking</font>

324
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,140
around on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think this is so</font>

325
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,770
potentially i think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a wonderful</font>

326
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:28,199
thing to investigate do you have a

327
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,329
society<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i had two questions do</font>

328
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,230
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sense of how long how long</font>

329
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:37,050
lived the information would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

330
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,270
think as long lived as the RFC series is

331
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think that was part of saying how long</font>

332
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,970
would it be useful a best current

333
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,170
operational practice how long it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

334
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,440
be useful is that what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font>

335
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one question I you'd have to</font>

336
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,620
ask the people in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right</font>

337
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,870
them I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would imagine they'd be</font>

338
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,440
useful for a while depending on the

339
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:01,380
topic right some of them I mean some of

340
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,780
the rfcs that were written from this

341
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,420
Community some people still use them

342
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,569
there's EGP communities and various

343
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,520
thing maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris has answer on the back</font>

344
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">or at least some shots at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chris</font>

345
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">Grundmann arm chair of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nano</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dcop</font>

346
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,390
committee the idea is that the documents

347
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,760
are living but in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

348
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,500
actually you know irrelevant it's until

349
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,050
technology changes or until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get a</font>

350
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,270
better idea so it's very righty they

351
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,329
could turn over fairly quickly but

352
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:31,760
hopefully in most cases they don't i

353
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,960
don't know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer but yeah</font>

354
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,060
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said it's the kind of it's the</font>

355
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,020
kind of thing I'm I'm think it would be

356
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:43,229
helpful too

357
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">notion about my other question was would</font>

358
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,150
you think that these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

359
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,400
would reflect the views of multiple

360
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:54,090
operator groups or would they be nanog

361
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:57,260
documents but my understanding from erin

362
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,790
was that you know these documents are

363
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,860
put together by various different

364
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,459
network operator groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it could</font>

365
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:10,770
conceivably be one from you know another

366
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:13,020
regional<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nog or and some from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog</font>

367
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,360
and you know the and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why the</font>

368
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,040
translation thing was an issue because

369
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
if they're in a different language we

370
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,140
would have to translate into<font color="#CCCCCC"> English</font>

371
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,850
they go through pasa sure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

372
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're used by all you know I</font>

373
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think when these documents are published</font>

374
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,099
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different knobs use them so and</font>

375
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,240
Joel I think maybe was<font color="#CCCCCC"> eluding this but</font>

376
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,440
it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

377
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,150
balloting these documents on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg</font>

378
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:44,430
that you know having having having

379
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:46,560
something that pitched accurately what

380
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,349
what you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the nanog</font>

381
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,930
review is this the operator view from

382
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,820
multiple operators things like that you

383
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,620
know knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that going in would be very</font>

384
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,690
helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us because that's likely to</font>

385
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,250
be a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

386
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,080
bellowing well if they're certainly if

387
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,180
they're independent submissions<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

388
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:07,220
boilerplate would say that right look

389
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:11,099
and then if they came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a nog</font>

390
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,959
working group I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine that maybe</font>

391
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,969
there would be more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one you know</font>

392
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,220
for different regions so we would het it

393
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,530
would have to they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say I</font>

394
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,780
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that be important I said I</font>

395
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,639
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really appreciate the are you</font>

396
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,139
doing this investigation really

397
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:31,260
appreciate the community talking about

398
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:34,800
it thank you anybody else sure aaliyah

399
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:39,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">atlas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot of their us fencers</font>

400
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,040
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what's different</font>

401
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,550
I mean there's a real difference between

402
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,860
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISC stream and Anna working group</font>

403
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,980
and the difference that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll talk it's</font>

404
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,590
the consensus spaced if we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

405
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,960
bcp is coming from multiple operator

406
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,120
groups how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get consensus about</font>

407
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,030
them do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you publish multiple conflicting</font>

408
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,059
ones do you want to see one where

409
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:06,299
there's agreement what for a would that

410
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:08,879
agreement be formed in and if you have a

411
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,770
working group that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would give a place to</font>

412
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,230
do it but then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be harder</font>

413
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,020
to have you know it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder to</font>

414
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,549
have separate overlapping ones right

415
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,230
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a discussion of why</font>

416
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:23,400
do we need these multiple can we combine

417
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:26,490
them and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and of course you know</font>

418
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,020
if a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp is going to be useful for one</font>

419
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,760
year that's very different from it being

420
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,460
useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> five or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten or fifteen years</font>

421
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,590
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how much efforts worth doing</font>

422
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,020
the reconciliation as a piece i would

423
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,760
really think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is do you really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

424
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:44,150
consensus how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to handle</font>

425
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,150
inputs from different operator groups oh

426
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:51,629
it's hard to see you guys on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> steve</font>

427
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">ulrich a quick question and maybe a</font>

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,400
comment related to chris's presentation

429
00:18:53,669 --> 00:19:00,900
earlier around IETF engagement with the

430
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">nogs I do find it curious that you some</font>

431
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,679
of the working groups don't necessarily

432
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,140
have to meet at an ietf and I wonder if

433
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,830
there's any utility and perhaps inviting

434
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,750
op<font color="#CCCCCC"> swagg to come and have an interim</font>

435
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,090
meeting perhaps a tan a nog events so

436
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:19,320
that the nanog membership could actually

437
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,459
see a working group in action see you

438
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,559
know what the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the sausage</font>

439
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,540
looks like that would actually be a

440
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">really guts a really good suggestion</font>

441
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,399
maybe the program community cuz work on

442
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:35,760
that would be great or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can help you as</font>

443
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:39,210
I good idea heaven is that Kevin Kevin

444
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,640
Bloomberg reminded me of a 1980s movie

445
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,820
about crossing the streams<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

446
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that crossing the streams is a</font>

447
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:57,059
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> ie a high level bcp that is</font>

448
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,610
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a community consensus and is</font>

449
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,830
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term document might be better for</font>

450
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:07,059
one stream versus a more

451
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:10,629
a more complicated or shorter lived even

452
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:13,690
subset of the same discussion might be

453
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,460
better in another screen I appreciate

454
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing really appreciate what</font>

455
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">you doing because the more we can get</font>

456
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:25,418
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to organizations like IETF the more</font>

457
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,889
weight it puts to the whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of best</font>

458
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:32,169
practices and that in itself is critical

459
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:35,769
but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> best practices are very</font>

460
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:39,130
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short lived</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within internet years</font>

461
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:47,730
and having using multiple streams might

462
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:53,860
be the right solution is that why you

463
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:57,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">need a bike there it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is no it's on like</font>

464
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,899
Sinatra<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes net of some working groups</font>

465
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,850
in the ITF have already done

466
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:02,739
coincidental meetings with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ugh</font>

467
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,360
they're not on site they're usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

468
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,429
the same town but there may be a few

469
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,149
blocks<font color="#E5E5E5"> away but the slider working group</font>

470
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:12,250
did that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times I think so if</font>

471
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:13,570
we can encourage more working<font color="#E5E5E5"> any any</font>

472
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,950
working group that might have

473
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,510
operational content or might benefit

474
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,720
from operational input should be

475
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:22,990
encouraged to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any meetings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

476
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,970
coincidental with like with um<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana that</font>

477
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:29,590
would be really great so just put a plug

478
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,760
in for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris Klieman again I just</font>

479
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to note that we could probably</font>

480
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,840
continue some of this conversation proxy

481
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:40,330
was greater detail in the bc o P track

482
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:43,510
which will be happening next um talents

483
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:46,210
I tell ya a great lead-in right so we

484
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">are having vco pietrzak coming up next</font>

485
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:52,779
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's i think around the corner in</font>

486
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:54,700
that salon em but just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in</font>

487
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:56,679
case uh people haven't sort of picked up

488
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,389
on why should<font color="#CCCCCC"> i care about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

489
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:01,059
some of the other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> alluded to it</font>

490
00:21:58,389 --> 00:22:02,678
but part of it is to give credibility to

491
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:05,789
our maturity as a professional

492
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:09,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization and and the</font>

493
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:14,350
multi-stakeholder governance model that

494
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:16,570
most in this arena seem to hold dear is

495
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,090
to give credibility to the two hour

496
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:22,620
ability to to manage our own affairs and

497
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:25,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know produce consensus-based</font>

498
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:31,139
documents about how we operate so that I

499
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,139
tu or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of other kinds of</font>

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:39,220
different culture standards bodies you

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">know can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be sort of kept at bay so you</font>

502
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,870
know it is important it's not just

503
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:49,330
process exercise for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the for the sake of</font>

504
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:52,299
it that's my two cents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I</font>

505
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the one comment</font>

506
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:55,779
to the program committee so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

507
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,639
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I presented it in nanog I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

overhead projector<font color="#E5E5E5"> and plastic</font>

509
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:02,949
transparencies and there's like a clock

510
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,220
and screens pretty awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here</font>

511
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,139
anyway that's bull thing and just a

512
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,669
pitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this side also it's so some of</font>

513
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:10,840
you are curious about actually dumping

514
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:12,730
to the other side and seeing what's

515

<font color="#E5E5E5">going on with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf or what is</font>

517
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,789
also a volunteer table out in the lobby

518
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,590
and there'll be folk staffing in all the

519
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:22,990
breaks so go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> come by with your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">questions of what is involved should you</font>

how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you help all the rest of it all</font>
