the discussion so John currents coming

up on a lightly compressed time frame

but we will give<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little consideration</font>

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,039
are pretty important one of them is the

28
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:26,570
DNS root zone and then there's the v4 v6

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,850
and asn registries um so we have iono

59
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,810
involved but the reality is that the US

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,230
government's role has been predominantly

61
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,329
to designate the party<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does these</font>

00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:24,050
this was fairly obvious

98
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,280
but they stated it clearly and that

team with 15 members three from each rir

131

to run a process in each of the regions

and combine those into a single proposal

133

that was an exciting process the team

was the consolidated<font color="#CCCCCC"> ri-ri in a</font>

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,640
lot more points of view depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

166

you've seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years of icann's</font>

168
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,390
as to what needs to be fixed so there's

169
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,340
a group called the cross community

170
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,070
working group the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cwg they are still</font>

171
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,960
working on their submission we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

172
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,840
have that yet there was a draft in

173
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">December very interesting graph that</font>

174
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,260
proposed new bodies several of them new

175
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,159
structures and that's still being worked

176
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:55,159
in that group um last week on Tuesday

177
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,740
Larry Strickland who's the assistant

178

secretary director of<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA for the</font>

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:03,920
Department of Commerce spoke at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

180
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,380
state of the net conference in DC and he

181
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,560
actually said a few things but he

182
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:12,110
responded directly with some questions

183
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community should consider about</font>

184
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS portion of this transition and</font>

185
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,610
the draft that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cwg has put together</font>

186
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put them there i'm not going to</font>

187
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:26,110
read them in say this draft has problems

188
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,280
he said here's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font>

189
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,610
people should think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about with this</font>

190
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,860
draft like if you create new bodies to

191
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,630
solve an accountability problem how do

192
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,630
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the new bodies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually</font>

193
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,630
accountable and so there's some valid

194
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,750
input there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS part of this is a</font>

195
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:48,620
work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get all</font>

196
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:52,580
of it together to get one proposal that

197
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,380
ntia can look at meet their criteria and

198
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,660
say okay we're not going to run this

199
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,880
anymore we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the respective</font>

200
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,089
communities are providing the real level

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">of oversight they now are the ones</font>

202
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:08,960
contracting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ayanna functions um</font>

203
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:11,420
victory conditions a proposal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA by</font>

204
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,160
July fifteenth which meets their

205
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,660
conditions and provides transition of

206
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,810
the stewardship to the global Internet

207
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:22,100
community that proposal needs community

208
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:26,329
support literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia has to know that</font>

209
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,430
the community in the IETF in the

210
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,550
community working on number resources

211
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,560
addresses in a SNS and in the DNS

212
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,900
community that they support the

213
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,989
resulting proposal now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where you</font>

214
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,089
come in because I have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

215
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,710
support this proposal or not absolutely

216
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:46,520
none some of you answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey some</font>

217
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:50,810
of you gave input um it's a proposal

218
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,970
it's out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's back one slide it's</font>

219
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,599
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for the numbers resource</font>

220
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,680
anyway and for the IETF portion of it if

221
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,740
you happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be interested in how the</font>

222
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,719
IETF is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's you folks have to</font>

223
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,209
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved you have to get involved in</font>

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,800
say you do support it you have to get

225
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:10,339
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in say you don't support it</font>

226
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:14,240
this is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia needs a</font>

227
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:16,760
body of record that knows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can</font>

228
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,620
do this safely now it's possible that

229
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,439
the proposal put together is completely

230
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,089
no good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if it is you folks</font>

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,740
need to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it could be it's</font>

232
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,540
wonderful it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

233
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,550
wonderful but you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the US</font>

234
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,180
government involved all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

235
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:34,339
valid conditions but input is needed

236
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this is pretty important because</font>

237
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,330
imagine yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US government</font>

238
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:41,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you should take</font>

239
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,520
this and relinquish it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

240
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,890
community you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know the Internet</font>

241
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,319
community believes that this is the

242
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,839
right way to do it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so its input</font>

243
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,140
time how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that well there will</font>

244
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,330
be obviously when this gets finalized

245
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,699
there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a comment period that's</font>

246
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,390
one way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also Department of</font>

247
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,280
Commerce<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA is</font>

248
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,510
you know right down in Washington easy

249
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,370
to go find the Department of Commerce

250
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,350
and talk to them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a great time</font>

251
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,450
you can explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you think of the</font>

252
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,510
process but involvement is pretty

253
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,880
important at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay potential</font>

254
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,910
implications successful transition

255
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,189
that'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty cool it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be you</font>

256
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,199
would say the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet's grown up and we</font>

257
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,660
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US government to be the</font>

258
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,690
anchor pin in all of this the community

259
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">has got structures it believes in a</font>

260
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,860
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transition would be</font>

261
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,110
interesting to the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> government said</font>

262
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,000
it's willing to get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if the</font>

263
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,830
US<font color="#CCCCCC"> government says well the resulting</font>

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,890
proposals no good or if the community

265
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,940
says the resulting proposals no good

266
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,380
there are a lot of governments<font color="#CCCCCC"> who think</font>

267
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,360
this should be turned over to a

268
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,010
government model even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's</font>

269
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,150
specifically ruled out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA</font>

270
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:53,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also another possibility and so</font>

271
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,990
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't go ahead with the transition</font>

272
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,040
we really don't know what happens we

273
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,170
don't know if the US government keeps

274
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:02,459
doing it we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if international</font>

275
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:04,170
discussions spin up but the fact is it

276
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,790
doesn't matter what<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters is whether</font>

277
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,610
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the resulting proposal</font>

278
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:13,290
and that your input<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being heard in</font>

279
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:17,340
this process I think that's it thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

280
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,140
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes mr. Hannigan hi</font>

281
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Martin Hannigan Akamai Technologies John</font>

282
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,410
can you clarify secretary Strickland's

283
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,040
comment a little bit it sounds like he

284
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:29,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">said having the rirs oversee themselves</font>

285
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:33,750
may be an issue um so his questions back

286
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:38,880
here were specifically about that DNS

287
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:41,430
portion of the the DNS portion of the I

288

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,420
predominantly about the DNS communities

look he acknowledged that two of the

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,740
three communities have submitted a

301
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,199

302
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">me one he commented on was the cwg draft</font>

303
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,570
which was a working draft for names so

304
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,160
once its range once the transition does

305
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:27,600
happen what is the oversight for the

306
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,730
rars so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that comes up is</font>

307
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,950
right now there's a contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I in a</font>

308
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,540

<font color="#E5E5E5">need to renew any of this because the</font>

315
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,510

316
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,740
it for two years with a modified

321
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:08,640
through its<font color="#CCCCCC"> MOU for the rirs it says</font>

322
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,490
we'll set up something similar what the

323
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,650
IETF has with an SLA and a reporting

324
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,300
function and that that will be reviewed

325
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,579
and they'll also be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> community-based</font>

326
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,280
team that will periodically get together

327
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,260
not just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RA our staff and executive</font>

328
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,199

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,319
community get together and look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

330
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,690
as well and for the DNS portion it's

331
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,300
about four or five different<font color="#E5E5E5"> bodies and</font>

332
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,680
it's still in flux so you should go look

333
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,439
at the crisp team graph to see

334
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,270
specifically what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it calls for that</font>

335
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,890
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> what NTIA is looking at in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> July</font>

336
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,630
to try to figure out whether it can

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,270
relinquish this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it needs to</font>

338
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,030
renew it so I read I read the proposal

339
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,860
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think though that there has</font>

the process for some period of time and

342
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,030
and if you're looking for feedback I do

343

interesting we don't have a model for it

400
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:14,950
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a transition what if it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't go well we actually don't know</font>

to unwind this so the importance of

having confidence and whatever we

working on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition but he also</font>

416
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,250
noted that Congress doesn't expect them

417
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,100
to be idle as it requires them to give

418
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,440
periodic reports to Congress between now

419
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,060
and the end of the fiscal year so they

420
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,550
are still involved they are still

421
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,250
monitoring it they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still responding</font>

422
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,899
to questions because they can't give a

report to Congress any other periodic

424
