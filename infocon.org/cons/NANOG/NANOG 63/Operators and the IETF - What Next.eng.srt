00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,960
and the first presenter is Chris

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about operators in the IDF</font>

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:27,720
and how going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very important to</font>

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">get more engagement there between the</font>

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:40,200
two organizations and constituencies and

8
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:41,130
blue yeah but thanks young good to see

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,930
so many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in the morning I</font>

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,520
hear there was a Katy Perry concert

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,260
associated with some sporting event

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,269
yesterday that maybe some folks are on

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,718
the word from so glad to see as many

14
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:57,059
folks here as there are yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> 27th to talk</font>

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">about an effort we're doing at the</font>

16
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,169
Internet Society we kind of coined it

17
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:02,850
operators in the ITF bra vs reasons it's

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,600
really kind of centered around a survey

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,250
we did last year asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions to</font>

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,179
operators about that participation in

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,320
the ITF and first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always step</font>

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,820
back a minute here because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,559
i say operators a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here is</font>

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">B and that's not exactly what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,530
when i say network operator in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,329
context at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm talking about</font>

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody who runs a network so whether</font>

28
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,380
it's a you know an enterprise network a

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,110
campus network you know network in a

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,189
data center whatever it might be you're

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,820
included here as an operator the ITF

32
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,679
hopefully most of you have at least

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,939
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it the gold the ITF is to make</font>

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,670
the internet work better very similar

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,229
goal to Tanana the ITF does it through

36
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,829
actually engineering standards and

37
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,439
protocols that we run on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so</font>

38
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,750
the dream right between these two is

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,490
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF would create standard</font>

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,320
protocols with operator input and they

41
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,490
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> work great every time right i mean</font>

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,048
the ITF obviously is extremely

43
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,329
successful none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us would be here if</font>

44
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,700
it wasn't we built these protocols of

45
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,770
getting it runs on fairly well working

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,009
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be better right and</font>

47
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,560
the reason is there's a perception at

48
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,720
least that many operators aren't engaged

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,520
enough that the the amount of in

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,080
operators and operational input into the

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,600
ITF process isn't isn't high enough

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,360
right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world should inform a</font>

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,769
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of what's going on there</font>

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,630
so we have a plan that the owner society

55
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,060
to kind of look at this phase one was a

56
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,560
survey last year we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had about three</font>

57
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,400
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sixty-eight respondents to</font>

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,030
the survey from all over the world

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,140
operators arm it closed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> July first of</font>

60
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,250
last year and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> digging in</font>

61
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,049
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was faced to us kind of</font>

62
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,270
synthesizing and starting to discuss the

63
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,580
survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> results I put about two hundred</font>

64
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,840
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some odd thousand miles on my</font>

65
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,010
frequent flyer card last year flying

66
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,780
around operator groups all over the

67
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,640
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about this and we've kind</font>

68
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,440
of assimilated all that information into

69
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,109
an internet draft which is linked here

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,550
and now we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to kind of</font>

71
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,350
continue that conversation start looking

72
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,360
at actually you know where the real

73
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,690
problems and and find some solutions for

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,980
those so looking really quickly at the

75
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,850
results of the survey about well the

76
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,769
respondents were overwhelmingly

77
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,690
technical and the vast<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority were</font>

78
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,420
operators which is good so we were

79
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,400
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the mix was about ninety two</font>

80
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,440
percent said they were engineers eighty

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent architects only about thirty</font>

82
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,560
eight percent said they were developers

83
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:25,239
and about half so they were managers or

84
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:26,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">as job role within that um the ITF</font>

85
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">participant still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about exactly half</font>

86
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,790
that they didn't participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all on</font>

87
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,380
the ITF about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third said that they</font>

88
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,970
participated on mailing lists and

89
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,549
eighteen percent said they actually

90
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,260
participated in both in mailing lists

91
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,340
and at the ITF meetings and so that was

92
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was pretty much the mix we were</font>

93
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,970
expecting and hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> for uh obviously</font>

94
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is looking at you know the problem</font>

95
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of why folks don't why operators don't</font>

96
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,350
participate in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF we really wanted</font>

97
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear from folks who don't participate</font>

98
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:53,350
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF but getting some context from</font>

99
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:56,260
those who do I think is helpful um but

100
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">this basically says here is among those</font>

101
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,459
who don't participate in the ITF at all

102
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,149
the vast majority right<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-six</font>

103
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,799
percent have heard of the IETF most of

104
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,239
them know what it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it looks like</font>

105
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,250
ninety two percent said that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

106
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,090
understand what it does and and even

107
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-thirds said that they think it's</font>

108
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,190
relevant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their job right the ITX</font>

109
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,269
doing is relevant to their job so so why

110
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,310
don't they participate right<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

111
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,020
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a survey of folks who didn't</font>

112
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,289
participate at all and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

113
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,490
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other numbers are clues here</font>

114
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:29,370
over half of this group reported that

115
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,450
they don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to participate and</font>

116
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,450
almost half said they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel well</font>

117
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,869
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a similar mix on mailing</font>

118
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:41,199
lists what pops out here is a lot of

119
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:42,579
folks you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to</font>

120
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">participate they understand that it's</font>

121
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:45,939
relevant but they're not participating

122
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">and why here it looks like time and</font>

123
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,599
awareness are our big issues huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> chunk</font>

124
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:51,099
so that they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand how</font>

125
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:53,259
to participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the mailing list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

126
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:55,299
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly goes on our mailing</font>

127
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:59,259
list and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time follow</font>

128
00:04:55,299 --> 00:05:01,089
the list meetings the big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

129
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,559
came up with meetings was money gobble

130
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:04,079
budget right getting to meetings all

131
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:05,919
over the world is fairly difficult

132
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,939
especially if it's you know just

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,799
something that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

134
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,819
operator right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all have actual day</font>

135
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,769
time jobs you trying to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network</font>

136
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,479
and so even just the time of going to a

137
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,369
meeting it's hard right<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to Tanana</font>

138
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,139
augas is something that your taxes

139
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:18,759
resources right if you're not not on

140
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:22,629
call and not not available here your

141
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,879
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i think that the general</font>

142
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:28,689
awareness question really was very

143
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:33,369
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we have really about half</font>

144
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:34,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">boats so they're not not aware it</font>

145
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:36,729
mailing lists<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a lot of the work</font>

146
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:38,199
happens about half the folks said that

147
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,979
they thought they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually show</font>

148
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:44,469
up to meetings to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> um only</font>

149
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">half were available that remote</font>

150
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,889
participation is available and so then

151
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,239
the other half again but they had to

152
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,300
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at meetings so there's obviously</font>

153
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:54,039
a knowledge gap here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think and when we</font>

154
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,809
dig into synthesizing these results we

155
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,759
suck titties that come out it's fairly

156
00:05:55,809 --> 00:06:00,219
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of four</font>

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,800
areas of issues here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are the red</font>

158
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,539
play time the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually have</font>

159
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,360
time to participate mailing lists<font color="#CCCCCC"> shobha</font>

160
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,610
meetings and really engage is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,749
barrier to entry culture is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one</font>

162
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,309
the folks say they don't feel welcome

163
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:13,869
obviously I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's a that's a</font>

164
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:16,239
culture issue there's definitely

165
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:18,099
different communities here at play money

166
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:19,719
came up over and over again as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as</font>

167
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,429
why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the meetings which i</font>

168
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:23,289
think is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

169
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:24,758
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a red herring because you don't have</font>

170
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">to participate in the meetings and you</font>

171
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,399
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be at a meeting to</font>

172
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,809
participate there's folks who have

173
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,889
written rfcs and how to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

174
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:31,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">entire process without ever showing up</font>

175
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,610
at a meeting it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very common</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

176
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:35,349
it's definitely possible so so that one

177
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,239
may be a less of an issue and more the

178
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:38,919
last point an awareness thing right

179
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:40,959
really an awareness of what is the ITF

180
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,279
working on why is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me why</font>

181
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,120
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I participate and then how I</font>

182
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:48,040
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually come in and participate</font>

183
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,410
so look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first challenge time this</font>

184
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,570
is a quote<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a paper the Randy bush</font>

185
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,740
published the ITF is grown so large and

186
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">enamored of complexity and feature itís</font>

187
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full-time job to participate</font>

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,180
and obviously if you running the network

189
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,000
you don't have time to spend all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

190
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,650
time at the IETF also i want to note the

191
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,240
date on this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 2005 this is not</font>

192
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,590
something that's a new problems is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

193
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,620
something that no one's have been aware

194
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it's an ongoing thing and so you know</font>

195
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,030
hopefully we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start looking</font>

196
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,260
at it and really addressing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy</font>

197
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">two percent of the participants said</font>

198
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,440
that they don't participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> 98 mailing</font>

199
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,270
list because they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

200
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and sixty-four percent said they don't</font>

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">come to meetings because they don't have</font>

202
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,080
time culture was the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue um one</font>

203
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,159
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quotes is the ITF is not really</font>

204
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,630
focused towards operations and

205
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,640
historically operator input has not been

206
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,840
well received so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty four percent of</font>

207
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,640
respondents here but they don't

208
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,539
participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF because they</font>

209
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,729
don't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that operator input is</font>

210
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,230
welcome right now I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn that</font>

211
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">around also it was another quote I</font>

212
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,200
perceive it to be full of pompous

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,990
self-serving out of touch<font color="#CCCCCC"> with reality</font>

214
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,700
technology actors so there may be some

215
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,890
cultural perceptions both ways but we

216
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,260
can't throw stones<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think there may</font>

217
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,210
be the ITF could possibly mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

218
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,670
welcoming but operators may need to be

219
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:59,620
more welcoming as well in Reverse money

220
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,520
again came up really highly eighty-two

221
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,360
percent said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason they don't</font>

222
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to meetings because they can't afford</font>

223
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,320
it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're pneus again i think</font>

224
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">is really one of the big be factors here</font>

225
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,840
fifty-eight percent of those who don't

226
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,110
participate the ITF at all but they

227
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,340
don't know how to and then the numbers

228
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,780
are similar for meetings and for mailing

229
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,310
lists right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see the numbers</font>

230
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,719
there books who<font color="#E5E5E5"> hadn't even heard of</font>

231
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,310
mailing lists books<font color="#E5E5E5"> who don't know what</font>

232
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,810
happens on them and folks who don't know

233
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,700
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join them as well as meetings</font>

234
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:28,780
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a meeting how do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

235
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:31,060
participate so that kind of brings us to

236
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,949
see the discussion point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to</font>

237
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,840
the multiple choice answers the

238
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,979
questions we done on the survey we also

239
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:42,310
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some free form text question</font>

240
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,870
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think those really start driving</font>

241
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,550
into possible solutions that are come

242
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,840
out of this and at least from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey</font>

243
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,329
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what I've heard talking to</font>

244
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,249
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world I think the</font>

245
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:55,199
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really three areas where we can</font>

246
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:58,029
find solutions here communication arm

247
00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:00,368
outreach and an inclusion right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then</font>

248
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:02,980
and the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font>

249
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:04,600
three places where those solutions can

250
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,920
happen at the IETF itself obviously

251
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,899
could potentially make changes and make

252
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,099
it easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> participate but operators</font>

253
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,839
and operator groups like this one like

254
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,040
nanog could potentially do things that

255
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">may make it easier for operators to</font>

256
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,160
understand what's going on at the ITF

257
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,719
and to participate and then perhaps the

258
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet Society my employer may be able</font>

259
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to step in and help if needed so looking</font>

260
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:23,619
at communication at least in the survey

261
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,089
results two big things in communication

262
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:27,220
came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> where mailing list digests and</font>

263
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,199
alternative communication mediums and

264
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,209
what do I mean um you know here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

265
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:32,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the quotes quarterly summaries for</font>

266
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,878
those that are not able to attend

267
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,439
provide a curating service that takes

268
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,209
key developments in a working group and

269
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:38,649
shares them from time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to time make it</font>

270
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,910
dead simple for folks to see the

271
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,439
specific topics being discussed and

272
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">worked on so I think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

273
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:44,799
this comes into play of the time issues

274
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:45,849
on the awareness issues of you know how

275
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,100
do I actually participate in follow a

276
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,949
mailing list it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know really really</font>

277
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,470
noisy when I have to run a network right

278
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:55,149
and so here's here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a potential area I</font>

279
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,129
present some of these solutions kind of

280
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,860
without judgment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm offering them up as</font>

281
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,759
a beginning of discussion right some of

282
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,540
these may be good ideas some of these

283
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,579
may be horrible ideas so<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be great um</font>

284
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,349
I twist on that this one I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

285
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:09,669
this idea highlight specifically which

286
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,009
group's efforts are looking for operator

287
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,779
input got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of way to signal to</font>

288
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,339
operators hey this draft actually needs

289
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,449
operators to look at it or this idea

290
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,829
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> some bedding from operators</font>

291
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:23,229
perhaps a really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure and</font>

292
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:25,209
then aside from just digesting the

293
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,379
mailing lists right maybe there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

294
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:29,138
ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate maybe there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

295
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:34,059
ways for the IHF to talk to participants

296
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:35,919
a simple speed back system on drafts and

297
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,379
discussions looking at questions asked

298
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,999
operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> surveys like this and then</font>

299
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:41,079
meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd send out surveys to the</font>

300
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,339
operators and say hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

301
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,419
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are relevant to the</font>

302
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,850
discussion and in that particular

303
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:48,100
technology development somebody

304
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,470
suggested podcasts right other ways to

305
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,600
get the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out interestingly</font>

306
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,910
one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the survey said that RSS</font>

307
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,410
feeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be a really good way for busy</font>

308
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,959
people to keep track of that the ITF

309
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually already publishes RSS feeds of</font>

310
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,160
recent rfcs recent internet-drafts

311

312
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,790
several other things there's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

313
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,949
mailing list RSS feeds you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> curso</font>

314
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,750
subscribe to so again coming back to the

315
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:13,120
awareness issue that may be a lot of

316
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,459
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just being engaged and being</font>

317
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,620
aware of what's already going on which

318
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,060
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to outreach within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outraged i</font>

319
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,769
think there's again two areas that we

320
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,239
could look out here direct outreach the

321
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,500
operator communities and then generating

322
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,100
publicity was another idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> popped</font>

323
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">up so direct outreach you know</font>

324
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,110
demystifying participation in the ITF

325
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:33,389
more liaisons smaller events the located

326
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,649

327
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:37,300
posting on mailing lists worldwide

328
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,889
getting the information out there to

329
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,628
more folks make it easier for folks to

330
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:42,879
understand what's going on at the ITF

331
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,829
and why and how to participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

332
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,750
vein one of the ideas that came up was

an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF help desk i'm actually trying</font>

please come with the help desk and ask

your questions and including you know

<font color="#CCCCCC">letting us know this is a horrible idea</font>

348
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,870
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> popped up in the kind</font>

358
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,420
potential idea for making books aware of

359
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,610
what the IETF is and does inclusion then

360
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,160
is the final one on making the operator

361
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,600
student feel more welcome but how right

362
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,610
maybe making participation of meetings

363
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,769
easier maybe making the process more

364
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,089
operator friendly maybe requiring an

365
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,130
operational input that was one idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

366
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,029
came up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then multilingualism there's</font>

367
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:59,019
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that came up again this</font>

368
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:00,579
was a global survey publishing agendas

369
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:02,410
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> grouping operationally relevant</font>

370
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,699
content together in the meeting making

371
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,430
it easier to come into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ITF meeting</font>

372
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,479
and get in and out so there's there's a

373
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,399
quite a few ideas here making

374
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,870
participation and meetings easier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

375
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,730
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe these are kind of at</font>

376
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,139
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tail end of my priority list in my</font>

377
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,300
head at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> because again you don't</font>

378
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily have to be at the meeting to</font>

379
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,949
participate

380
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,200
so maybe making the wrong with

381
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,150
dissipation better and making people

382
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware of that is more important the</font>

383
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,500
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself could potentially be more</font>

384
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,520
operator friendly again you know when

385
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,960
there's some folks that are dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

386
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,860
this is kind of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of day</font>

387
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,960
right when you actually developing

00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,670
co-developing hardware and this is what

389
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,630
you do day in and day out you can spend

390
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of time on it when you're an</font>

you know operator working groups there's

396
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,640
operator councils except that operated

397
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,230
requests may be valid eve if they're not

398
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,000
in agreeing with existing opinions these

400

issues and inclusion one of the ideas

401
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,780
that came out was to require operational

402
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,069
input a few folks said this require

403
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,530
standards to get by<font color="#CCCCCC"> and by a variety</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

404
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,850
operators or define a specific class of

405
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,880
documents they require the participation

406
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,220
of at least two operators um another one

407
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,330
the comment in there was talking about

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BC elpida vesicare operational</font>

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,530
that's going on here at nanog and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that might tie the operator group to the</font>

some problems we heard some solutions

418
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,660
next first I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lay this out as as</font>

419
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,490
kind of a matrix of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions we</font>

stock them up and the problems we saw

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,340
areas communication outreach and

424
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,900
inclusion kind of being solutions to

425
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,760
those the money one doesn't get solved

426
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,290
very easily but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

427
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,569
know not coming to meetings is an option

428
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,890
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we if we build up the</font>

429
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,210
communication in a way that the lowers

430
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,650
the time barrier but it's you know

431
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,720
easier to participate on an operator

432
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:58,270
schedule do more outreach that there's

433
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,860
more awareness of the IETF and then be

434
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,689
inclusive right on both sides again

435
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,250
right operators need to come to the IETF

436
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,120
with open eyes and the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiffany's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">welcome them with open arm so the real</font>

438
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,660
next steps here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are hosts discussions</font>

439
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,119
gather feedback that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing</font>

440
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,650
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from you guys at</font>

441
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,210
the mics right now if there's anything

442
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,579
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that's you know complete</font>

443
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:21,520
craziness or really good ideas you have

444
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,680
your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas and then also you know</font>

445
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,300
onwards beyond this right there's email

446
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,709
addresses will have up later and other

447
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,329
ways to get involved where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can share</font>

448
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,650
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have right</font>

449
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,460
now or I'll be here the next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

450
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,860
days if I mean

451
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,820
way let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me know we're gonna take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

452
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that information and we're going to</font>

453
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,790
update<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet draft we want to</font>

454
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,110
synthesize this in the future versions

455
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,150
and really have a good problem statement

456
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,030
in solution set in the draft is kind of

457
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,380
a documentation of all that went on here

458
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,339
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then potentially lobby for specific</font>

459
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,470
solutions right if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> things here</font>

460
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,000
that are good ideas let's stand up and

461
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:54,280
say that they're good ideas and get them

462
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,180
done this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in I need</font>

463
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,040
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to me I need you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font>

464
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,750
that internet-draft and let me know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

465
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,939
you think the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> address is there to</font>

466
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,830
play 360 @ xorg we're all over social

467
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,660
media there's a contact page there for

468
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,210
my team and then obviously anyone at the

469
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:11,640
IETF is probably open ears to this as

470
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:16,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">well Oh with that it's an internet draft</font>

471
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,230
it could someday become an RFC with that

472
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:24,870
I'd be happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any questions now</font>

473
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:24,870
or gather feedback please it's the hand

474
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ap a guy I used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to a lot of I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> etfs</font>

475
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,650
and then they started distributing them

476
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,980
all over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it became very</font>

477
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,840
difficult to attend in different

478
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,650
countries these things at the same time

479
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,570
it really is important to get inculcated

480
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,130
into their<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture and know the people</font>

481
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,350
and where they're coming from and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

482
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,360
the different perspectives same his<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

483
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,430
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those hallway conversations are</font>

484
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,860
really aren't quite valuable so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

485
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,829
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> this remote participation thing is</font>

486
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,150
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the best way to go forward I</font>

487
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,730
do think the things you're doing with

488
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:09,160
the best current operating practices

489
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,110
among a group of network operators in

490
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,820
this room it's very convenient we can

491
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,159
get together and have discussions and

492
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:18,129
and create documents so that seems to be

493
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">a much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better approach in my opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

494
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,900
getting that information into the IETF

495
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:25,149
is if weekend as a collective provide

496
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,240
that information the other thought is

497
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:32,050
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who go to the ITF tend</font>

498
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,520
to be the vendors why do we as customers

499
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,800
need to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their for and why don't</font>

500
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">they come to our forum and hero we have</font>

501
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:42,730
to say excellent points hi I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cathy</font>

502
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,290
Aronson um I just have a had one of

503
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:47,890
these headlines for you guys

504
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,870
autonomic networks there's a big push in

505
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,270
the ITF for autonomic networks they

506
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,280
manage themselves they reconfigure

507
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:57,129
themselves there you know we don't

508
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,320
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need these network operators so I</font>

509
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,140
just thought maybe I would add you on to

510
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,970
maybe look that up and so that there's

511
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,580
the three of us that are there aren't

512
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only voices when they say oh no we</font>

513
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,550
don't need to network operators because

514
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,020
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making autonomic networks and</font>

515
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,200
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff for you</font>

516
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,940
anyway just I thought absolutely that's

517
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,490
good one too if you're not engaged now

518
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:24,520
that's probably good one to start with

519
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:26,710
Skynet is coming Randy bush i J I have

520
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,770
to congratulate this room on the largest

521
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,890
collection of Miss information about the

522
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">ITF I've heard a long while and I go to</font>

523
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ITF have for a couple years um have</font>

524
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,590
serious problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it etc but going</font>

525
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,180
to the ITF as a collective doesn't work

526
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:48,070
ITF our individual experts<font color="#E5E5E5"> fatty so</font>

527
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,590
saying we're going to put together an an

528
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:54,070
odd position is I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

529
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:58,540
instead that though I they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

530
00:18:54,070 --> 00:19:00,820
speaker before Kathy um the secondly no

531
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,460
one is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the ITF and saying</font>

532
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,770
we don't need operators etc right

533
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,010
thirdly<font color="#E5E5E5"> their fair number of operators</font>

534
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:18,190
in the ITF who here goes the ITF aside

535
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:19,900
for me yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's get real here if</font>

536
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,100

that mothers as well because then it

538
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:27,159
makes my life a lot easier I want to do
