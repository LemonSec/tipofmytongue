00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,170
thank you my name is Rajee<font color="#E5E5E5"> ball of</font>

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">Emperor product in charge like part of</font>

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,420
the product team in brooklyn for the

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,330
routing products so there has been some

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,910
good sessions on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> d</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dose and other</font>

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,520
security or you know the topics over

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,150
here so but i wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share with you</font>

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,719
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across the internet</font>

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,839
data privacy in simple terms means

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,610
protect what's yours so especially when

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,649
you have you know these large flows

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,570
content growing going<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the</font>

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,300
internet then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the challenges</font>

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,159
right so that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are seeing and we are</font>

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,589
hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share those findings</font>

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,589
with you into the next light

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,550
so in the data privacy we are seeing

18
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,590
like strong growing interest there are a

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,110
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons one is the data breaches</font>

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,450
so you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be hearing you know last</font>

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,299
year they have been data beaches for the

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,040
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> in transit and like on the on</font>

23
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints like you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font>

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,590
terminals and why are these data breach

25
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,929
is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so data beaches are</font>

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,060
motivated by multiple things one is the

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,490
intellectual assets it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,040
when you leave your home and you have

29
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,169
your laptop bag with you then what do

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have for you hope for like you know</font>

31
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,910
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes it but you know what is</font>

32
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:41,320
worse than somebody taking or stealing

33
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:44,259
your laptop bag is somebody be able to

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,908
take the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and so that is one of</font>

35
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the primary motivations is similarly</font>

36
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,710
when you have data going<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the</font>

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,360
transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially the internet then</font>

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,770
intellectual assets and then there could

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,770
be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your customer information</font>

40
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,630
on it there could be a the premium

41
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,300
content content is king as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know right</font>

42
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,310
so somebody are taking your content away

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,110
from you I mean without paying you

44
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,470
without any charge I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

45
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:11,799
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that they own or another</font>

46
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,769
key driver is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the regulations so which</font>

47
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:16,750
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in the infrastructure</font>

48
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:18,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might care about your data center</font>

49
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,780
data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sort of like data</font>

50
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,609
privacy but similar to you so your

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,440
customers have different drivers like

52
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,350
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example health care would hear about</font>

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,579
HIPAA financials would care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,780
sarbanes and similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI and not</font>

55
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:37,150
only that like you know the media

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,940
companies would care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Holly</font>

57
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,620
protecting their content so it doesn't

58
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,390
stay that you know they have to have the

59
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,880
security but then given the nature of

60
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the business that's how it's you know so</font>

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting there in terms of the</font>

62
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,690
opportunity encryption yes but then

63
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,299
they're more few examples i would like

64
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,049
to share or the findings is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

65
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">a remote data center or another one is</font>

66
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,980
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have let's say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your layer two</font>

67
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks so layered two networks you are</font>

68
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,709
the fibers with your customers connected

69
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,870
in but what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you can have them</font>

70
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,120
come across the internet site still<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

71
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,450
have the fiber available remote caching

72
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,989
side

73
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:20,018
can be another example so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

74
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:22,660
details of what to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could</font>

75
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:24,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">vary that word that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> depends on the</font>

76
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,040
nature of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> your the content and the</font>

77
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,900
business and your customers it could be

78
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disaster recovery traffic across the</font>

79
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,190
internet video video has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> growing</font>

80
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,989
right so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're sending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from let's</font>

81
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,400
say one studio to another or from a

82
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,760
distribution side to the different

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,849
studios it's going from 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> k-2 2k and</font>

84
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,280
soon it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to 4k and 8a so</font>

85
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,488
imagine the flow the flow size going

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,739
from you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like from sub 1 gig</font>

87
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:55,060
several gay to even probably like you

88
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:56,319
know or 10 gig medical imaging financial

89
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,459
information are some of the other

90
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,670
examples here so the use case what is

91
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the use case here use cases imagine like</font>

92
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,530
you have two data centers and you have

93
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,200
the bulk transfers right so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,880
customers who are experimenting you know

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,280
so we see thy the customers who are

96
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,918
experimenting or the communities who are

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,350
experimenting like you know so going

98
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,289
from one guy to ten gayi 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig close</font>

99
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,479
now across the internet you may not put

100
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,909
100 gig that might be quite a bit but

101
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,099
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like you know going from sub</font>

102
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,020
1 gig to like several one gig to like

103
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,990
you know so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 gig how do you get</font>

104
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,090
there and it's not data center to data

105
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,310
center you could have the campus you

106
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,200
could have the remote stadium<font color="#CCCCCC"> site you</font>

107
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,880
could have the branch offices so it's

108
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,770
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the same network the</font>

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,570
important part here is that how do you

110
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,760
connect them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all together end right so</font>

111
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,800
because if you have these<font color="#CCCCCC"> sites then</font>

112
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,320
what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do or what level of</font>

113
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,270
encryption right so so and the what is

114
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost of doing and not</font>

115
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,830
doing that and that's where the

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,130
challenges comes in which varies by the

117
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,729
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the use case but first one</font>

118
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,349
is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a stigma right so the first</font>

119
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,599
portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we hear from the customers</font>

120
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:13,450
when they think about the data privacy

121
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:16,510
is the impact of the performance

122
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:20,469
performance is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to all all</font>

123
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,940
the all the operators right so every<font color="#E5E5E5"> bid</font>

124
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they can ship out on the network</font>

125
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,889
without having to drop the performance

126
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,370
is a plus so there has been

127
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,379
this stigma associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

128
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,150
encryption is that if you turn on the

129
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:36,249
encryption in your network then the

130
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,830
performance goes by at least fifty

131
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:40,840
percent or even higher so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

132
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one challenge that we hear so I</font>

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,330
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share that with you second one</font>

134
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,150
is what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the larger size of ipsec</font>

135
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,758
tunnel so so some of the operators are

136
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,188
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if they</font>

137
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,319
put the ipsec tunnel like ipsec in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

138
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:58,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">network what is the largest they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

139
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,669
to can it scale through the requirement

140
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,739
can it handle like 10 gig flows for

141
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,500
example like inter data center bulk

142
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,599
transfers so the data rates have been

143
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,300
going up and up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is no stopping</font>

144
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:16,210
so how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you push like what is</font>

145
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:18,250
the biggest flaw that she can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the</font>

146
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">third one over here is aggregation hub</font>

147
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,849
if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use case the scenario</font>

148
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:27,099
is distributed or take an example of the

149
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:31,839
brand sides let's say you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 brand</font>

150
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:33,550
side with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one gig each so do you want do</font>

151
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,439
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want a full mast do you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

152
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,569
you know every branch to have tunnels

153
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,919
with other<font color="#E5E5E5"> brands or do you want to be</font>

154
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,409
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all of them talk to each</font>

155
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,930
other so how do you do it so that

156
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:45,399
requires the heck<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregation hub so</font>

157
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,409
what should be the capacities of the

158
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,960
heck dication hub so that is has been

159
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:52,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the limiting factors also is that</font>

160
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,448
if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 branches as an example of</font>

161
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:57,879
one gig that would translate into a 20

162
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:00,479
game but what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to go and</font>

163
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,149
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scale up to 200 branches</font>

164
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,889
then what would be a requirement because

165
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:07,689
then you would have 200 branches coming

166
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,029
in and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to they want to be able</font>

167
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,889
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other right so that</font>

168
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,620
would translate into like somebody be

169
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:19,509
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle 200 gig enter play</font>

170
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:22,169
traffic encryption level encryption

171
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:26,020
level has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been very popular like 20 of</font>

172
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:28,628
128 bits has been out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

173
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ipsec and other implementations it's</font>

174
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:32,800
not new it's a very popular mechanism

175
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,050
ipsec is a very progressive technology

176
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,419
so it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for decades</font>

177
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,490
very well used like in too many and

178
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:40,510
networks with with the you know small

179
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,150
medium large

180
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,270
appointments but what is new what is

181
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">changing what is challenging is that is</font>

182
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,340
128-bit encryption enough so so does it

183
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,520
protect what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about and that's</font>

184
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason so how about aes-256 so that</font>

185
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,969
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something like another</font>

186
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,650
challenge like challenge number for that

187
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,240
would like to point out here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

188
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,919
something to think about when you're

189
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,210
thinking about the data privacy across

190
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet last but not least there</font>

191
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,400
could be many when we talk about

192
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet it's not an easy thing because</font>

193
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,419
you would need like you know several

194
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,070
factors which play a role but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

195
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">one that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to point out and</font>

196
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,900
share with you is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the frame</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side so what</font>

197
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,270
happens with these encryptions is once

198
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,450
you turn on the encryption it adds an

199
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:32,199
extra header so when you have 120 bits

200
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:35,799
as 120 bites of a packet size your tax

201
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,540
is going to be up to like 64 bytes that

202
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,630
means like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your performance is</font>

203
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be impacted so so what so what</font>

204
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,189
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> butt so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could make it very</font>

205
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:48,910
challenging like with the small traffic

206
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,700
or the small sizes what if like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

207
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,189
you do to basically mitigate that how

208
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,220
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,500 byte packets right or even</font>

209
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,500
higher by doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what happens is</font>

210
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,020
that your tax is still same its tail

211
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,690
says add that extra header off up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 64</font>

212
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,670
bytes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you increase the size then</font>

213
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,260
that would be a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce that tax</font>

214
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,329
and have the performance out of your

215
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so that you have high</font>

216
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,580
performance network with encryption just

217
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,490
like you do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your 10 gig 40</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gain 100</font>

218
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,150

between you and your lunch but if you

220
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:28,240
have any questions to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a painful push</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so is there if there is one potion</font>

226
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:56,980
should say or normally would say thank

227
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,149
you very much for coming but maybe I

228
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,670
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better to say thank you very</font>

229
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,620
much for staying but thank you also to

230
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,199
the program committee for having I trust

231
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I don't ously have to rush because</font>

232
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't have anything following this</font>

233

237
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,099
we were doing over the past three or

238
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:23,499
four weeks myself and a couple of

239
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:28,779
colleagues at DePaul University James

240
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and match a I if you were paying</font>

241
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,579
attention earlier this morning you

242
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,910
probably would have heard something

243
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:35,620
about net comp and if not I'm afraid I

244
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,019
won't have time to go over what netconf

245
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,610
is but if i can get you to look up from

246
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:43,600
your laptops for just a moment how many

247
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,069
of you actually have some netcom running

248
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,889
that you may or may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using in your</font>

249
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:49,449
network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by show of hands a fair</font>

250
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:52,089
number of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few dozen</font>

251
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:54,250
anyways that's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume most</font>

252
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,290
of you that raised your hand probably

253
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're doing it with with juniper gear</font>

254
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,230
but would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my guess and if not it I</font>

255
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:00,819
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear otherwise perhaps</font>

256
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,559
after and if you are you to have

257
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,420
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in your config</font>

258
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:09,250
tree where you turn this on under your

259
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:11,110
services you'll you may note or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may</font>

260
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,100
be learning for the first time that net

261
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,680
comp by default runs over TCP port 830

262
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,750
now if you're a user of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old Jew no</font>

263
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,689
script which is what this has arisen

264
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,179
from you could run<font color="#E5E5E5"> that over port 22 as</font>

265
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:26,410
well but people are turning on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for</font>

266
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:29,649
the first time by default will have it

267
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,620
over tcp port 30 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't realize</font>

268
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:35,370
this until not long ago in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network</font>

269
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">we had we were looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some other</font>

research stuff with multicast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

274
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:50,120
being somewhat newer and then when I

275
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,790
figure or when we figured it out

276
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,380
we realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was on a lot of</font>

277
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,360
boxes and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us really realized</font>

278
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,060
that it was someone had turned it on for

279
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,820
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so then we wondered well</font>

280
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,859
who else has this on and do they know

281
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,870
about it and what sorts of potential

282
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,940
issues might there<font color="#E5E5E5"> be for those who may</font>

283
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:13,220
be unaware that this stuff may be turned

284
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:15,680

<font color="#CCCCCC">in fact a lot of the stuff that's in</font>

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,339
hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so maybe we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should do a</font>

299
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:50,510
new version of this because it's so well

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got out of date so I went look or</font>

301
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,250
we went looking we scanned one of the

302
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:57,709
probes that we did it just took a 10

303
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,600
million random ipv4 addresses and we

304
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:03,170
said well who who will respond to us and

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP 4830 and let's follow up that and</font>

306
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,729
see if we get an ssh connection and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a random skin in the address space</font>

308
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,950
for that we've actually found very few

309
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,110
not not many at all some but not very

310
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:19,430
many if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the security track</font>

311
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:22,390
yesterday you may have noticed or saw

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,620
is that'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a homework to figure it</font>

out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a way to identify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Geno's</font>

317
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,900

318
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,240
those specifically and then probe those

319
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,240
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found at least comparatively</font>

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,180
higher percentage of boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that do have</font>

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,070
net comp listening and some the versions

of jew nose running vary quite widely

323
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,940
and some facts some will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running</font>

324
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,830
that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> H less than version to a</font>

326
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,030
implementation is to run over ssh but

327
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,790
there's also an RFC that says you can do

328
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,140
net comp over TLS there's also one that

329
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,520
says you can do it over beep but I don't

330
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,250
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any</font>

331
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,780
actually does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but over TLS so we</font>

332
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,100
said well then that's a different port

333
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,620
so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

334
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,810
probe randomly and we found some there

335
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,870
even a few more than we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have found</font>

336
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,339
over port 830 from a random scan and

337
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,140
those are actually kind of interesting

338
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,330
so i thought i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you a couple</font>

339
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,189
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we found and i hope you</font>

340
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,420
can see this in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and so if</font>

341
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,010
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at your laptop's this is</font>

342
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,349
where you you look up and you chuckle a

343
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:32,170
little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make fun of ATT this is a</font>

344
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:36,220
this is a box<font color="#E5E5E5"> from ATT that does have</font>

345
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,140
net conf over port 830 open but port 22

346
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,060
is filtered so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably in the</font>

347
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,170
situation where they've they thought

348
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,260
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were locking down the routers</font>

349
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,180
probably enabled nap comp and forgot to

350
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,800
put a filter on their loopback interface

351
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,479
for that as well I'm the certificate

352

side so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at netcom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for were</font>

may note that last one a dot mil

361
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,280
people's eyebrows always tend to rise

362
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,730
slightly when you hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a dot mil</font>

363
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,050
being exposed with something that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

364
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if that name matches the IP</font>

365
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,930
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I can assure you</font>

366
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the IP address that that was</font>

367

<font color="#E5E5E5">associated with was it no address so</font>

368
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:33,460
this stuff is certainly out there now

369
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,020
the question must be asked well is it a

370
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,670
big deal is that we know what's the

371
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,699
threat here how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a problem really</font>

372
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:44,349
is this and it may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much i'm</font>

373
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,730
not here to cry wolf and i would suggest

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,910
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we could some of this up don't</font>

375
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,370
panic but there may be threats and so

376
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,930
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why we wanted to try to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

377
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,880
better look at this and bring this to

378
00:15:52,930 --> 00:16:00,069
your attention perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the ssh</font>

379
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,650
netcom to the things that i might be

380
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">most worried about if it were me would</font>

381
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:07,569
be the ability to perhaps do a denial of

382
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,540
service attack on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> netcom service</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by default your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> junos boxes have a</font>

384
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,530
connection limit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could tie</font>

385
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,380
those up whatever you may have doing net

386
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,079
cough may not be able to get through

387
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,420
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably more</font>

388
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,440
worrisome is if you have weak passwords

389
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:28,170
associated with a ID some account on

390
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,960
this box we've certainly seen as a sage

391
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,760
brute force attacks in the past we

392
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly don't want to see any more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

393
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,230
them so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't Italy make the</font>

394
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,400
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> really that much worse unless</font>

395
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,870
those people who thought they were

396
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,180
protected with their loot bag filters

397
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:46,790
don't actually have them protected now

<font color="#E5E5E5">this TLS services certificate one I</font>

399
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,579
think there's a fair amount of detail on

400
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,260
the certificate that's quite interesting

401
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,110
I don't know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would consider it</font>

402
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">high risk of that being exposed but the</font>

403
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,400
one thing I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure about yet we</font>

404
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:03,390
haven't studied we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished</font>

405
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:07,589
studying this is that my fear is those

406
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:10,020
systems that do netcom over TLS may not

407
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,720
have strong authentication you may just

408
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to attach to them and perhaps</font>

00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,260
effectively anything you would be able

411
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do via command line but just using</font>

412
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,890
that comp if anyone knows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

415

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,280
these to you but I would be interested

424
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear if you think this is worthwhile</font>

425
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,510
should we continually provide some sort

426
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">of day to feed like team comer does for</font>

427
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,240
other things do you want to know about

428
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff in your network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm pretty</font>

429
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,860
certain many of you here probably have

430
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,210
some of this stuff maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just told you</font>

431
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,090
something about your network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

432
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,030
know once you go looking so I'd be

433
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:14,340
curious to hear any response to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

434
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:17,190
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort and how much more time we</font>

435
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">should spend on it and with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thank</font>

436
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,510
you very much for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your attention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

437
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,510
time

438
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:28,650
I think that's Michael in fact it is

439
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,600
like Sinatra yes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um keep in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

440
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff also runs on ipv6 by default</font>

441
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,070
if you have ipv6 turn on your router

442
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,870
well the net conf isn't turned on by

443
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:41,790
default is what if so you isn't turned

444
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,290
on by default if you turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font>

445
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,060
turn it will go so if you run like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

446
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Juno space appliance in your network and</font>

447
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,780
you think you're blocking all traffic to

448
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,460
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that but you forget to</font>

449
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,050
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the filter in ipv6 it's the same</font>

450
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're going to open ipv6 to the whole</font>

451
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:57,389
world so I say this from experience

452
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,250
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a obscure enough</font>

453
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,260
problem but yeah this stuff runs on ipv6

454
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:07,490
to let me make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your ipv6</font>

455
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:10,320
filters match your ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you sir</font>

456
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">laminex hundred curator loves what do</font>

457
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would happen exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU</font>

juniper box will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be completely exhausted</font>

460
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,350
like one hundred percent accusation what

461
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:30,210
could happen yeah what would happen well

462
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:31,770
this is somewhat nightly specific to net

463
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,040
comp but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i suppose number of things</font>

464
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,180
could happen your routing protocols may

465
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,649
start dropping packets the routing

466
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,410
sessions may drop all that sort of stuff

467
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:43,170
right and please and things will happen

468
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:47,490
so don't expose your control plane to

469
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,570
public network right<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that I think</font>

470
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,600
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of that I think that's part</font>

471
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:57,929
of what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying yes that's it ok I</font>

472
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,020
think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished for you thanks very</font>

473
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,020
much

474
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,610
