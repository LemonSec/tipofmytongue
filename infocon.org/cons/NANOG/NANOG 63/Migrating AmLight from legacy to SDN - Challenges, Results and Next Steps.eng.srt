00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,410
talk is migrating am light from legacy

17
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,439
so first of all let me introduce some of

18

the names are going to see here along

19

the presentation first of all the one of

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,789
the most important is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the empath empath</font>

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,350
is the academic exchange point there is

00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:05,139
all of this is possible through the

talk to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> network devices assume that</font>

55
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,319
you can have different vendors and

different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of device and today the</font>

57

most popular protocol for this interface

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,670
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> openflow most part of you heard</font>

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,400
production support where is called the

67
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,560
hybrid mode the hiring mode is the mode

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,960
when the switch supports some of the

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">ports using open flow and some of the</font>

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,320
parts using STM I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> using legacy</font>

71
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:29,200
so you can have legacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and open flow in</font>

72
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,750
the same switch but some vendors also

73
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,480
support was called the hybrid port the

74
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">hybrid power supports both modes in the</font>

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,820
same port which is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good for</font>

76
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,160
incremental deployments and for you to

77
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,100
have a backup between both words so you

78
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">can have feelings and open flow flows in</font>

79
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:51,880
the same port and one provide the

80
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:54,250
redundancy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other and with as the</font>

81

end everything in your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

links that were the slides will be

93
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:24,100
available so what was this<font color="#CCCCCC"> step-by-step</font>

94
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we create for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our project the idea</font>

95
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,040
here exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and introduce the</font>

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,280
methodology we use and show how<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our scenario first of all it</font>

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,539
seems kind of obvious for most part of

99
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,760
you you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a good</font>

101
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to know all the protocols you have</font>

102
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,810
you need to know all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> serbs and</font>

103
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,760
applications you support because knowing

104
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,000
this is how you're going to choose the

105
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,770
right application for you this problem

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this moment if you decide to</font>

107
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,530
migrate your network you're not going to

108
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,070
find an application that supports

109
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,950
everything that you have but let's say

110
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,590
they decide to start slowly it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

111
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,870
know everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even case</font>

112
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,700
in small things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sometimes we don't</font>

113
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,009
take in consideration like link

114
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,710
aggregation so document everything

115
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:18,740
our case the<font color="#E5E5E5"> M light was issue is a</font>

116
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,659
layer to transport network so pretty

117
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">much everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 now</font>

points that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before um light</font>

120
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,139
just provide connectivity between them

121
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,569
and at the end light we had the link

is the assessments of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

133
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:02,990
of course is also very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

134
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:06,409
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand what your current</font>

devices support so does your device

00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:13,039
support open flow if yes what version

<font color="#E5E5E5">101 dot 3 1 dot 4 so you have to be sure</font>

your brand your vendor in your device

145
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:34,550
because some sweets right now some

00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,849
sometimes this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

150
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:47,149
have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in consideration and</font>

151
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:49,188
one thing is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the OpenFlow crate</font>

152
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:51,469
is a lot of specification but it doesn't

153
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:54,080
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the vendors are compliant</font>

154
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:55,519
to all the specifications so this is

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">very important for you to know what</font>

156
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,099
exactly what kind of option of teachers

157
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:03,319
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in your vendor so does it</font>

158
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:05,748
support the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payflow wonder 0</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 dot 0</font>

159
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,209
does not support POS for example but if

160
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:09,740
you have one two three<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of</font>

161
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,599
option of teachers you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

162
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,939
mirroring table what kind of features

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,399
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have for the poor group your vendor</font>

164
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,189
supports link aggregation for example

165
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:22,219
your vendor support intercommunication

166
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,060
between legacy and open flow flows all

167
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:26,610
of this you must know

168
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,990
and one of course very important thing

169
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:32,639
is does your device support support

170
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:36,180
hybrid port because he's going to make

171
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,040
her life a lot easier in our case I'm

172
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not gonna go through all of the details</font>

173
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,200
but we only had broke a device's we had

174
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,300
broke a<font color="#CCCCCC"> damn Alexei and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ex Ahmad are</font>

176
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,860
brand there is a metro and the moment

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we deployed the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> openflow the only</font>

here this was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> August last year but</font>

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,220
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> broke is also supports one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

about your advice the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

if you have a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and you</font>

design the future to deploy IP or

install your WP routes in your open flow

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,840
the capacitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your advice in our case</font>

192
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,960
the main limitations are the number of

193
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:38,309
flows purport we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4,000 for the</font>

just working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with villain so this was</font>

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:46,140
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the support for hybrid</font>

198
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,199
important but we realize one of the arts

199
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,900
which do not support is and we had to

200
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,089
work around to get a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

incremental deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

202
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:00,660
a little bit more later so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

203
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,210
understand the number of controllers

204
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,270
available the kind of match is that your

205
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,339
device supports for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

206
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,199
do everything based on later to most

part of sweet soup or later too much but

208
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,160
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,810
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the switch support the software</font>

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:21,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">supports but you also have to be sure</font>

212
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,579
that all the line cards you have in your

213
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,440
device support is very common that

214
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,680
different line cars have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

215
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,959
of supports and some of them supported

216
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,420
only later to sometimes literally three

<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that you need to understand</font>

important things some switches do not

232
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,720
is very important for you you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

very careful about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you cannot</font>

00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,740
some switches don't support statistics

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,680
for all the flow some switches don't

238
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,269

241
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,800
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the account of the traffic so</font>

242
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:37,740
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you have to be</font>

243
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,829
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful in the past most part of us</font>

244
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,439
use the SNMP to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

245
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:45,628
villain information but and now that you

00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:47,370
have replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> for open flow entries you</font>

00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,050
need to be sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the OpenFlow</font>

results there you're expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

250
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:59,819
the SNMP also and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have open flow</font>

251
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:01,949
ports in our case the the Brocade is not

252
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:03,599
support later to control protocols so

253
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,878
you cannot have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spanning tree in the</font>

254
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,399
port even though you can have the hybrid

255
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,990
port that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy and open flow in the</font>

256
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,480
same port you cannot have the spanning

257
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,490
tree in the legacy side of the port so

258
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,889
this force sometimes you to change the

259
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">topology that you have and you have</font>

260
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:21,300
limitation as the amount of villains

261
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:25,259
supporting the hybrid port in our cases

262
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,929
just 40 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem but again you</font>

263
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,360
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay attention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

264
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,860
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is is that was a problem</font>

265
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,199
for us because the Brocade does not

266
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,329
support link aggregation that you enable

267
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:41,040
open flow in the link aggregation ports

268
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:44,279
so every flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> there has to follow the</font>

269
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,819
open the link aggregation port we have

270
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,740
to create a workaround and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

271
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Brocade does not support a</font>

272
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,680
communication between

273
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,080
legacy traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open flow trafficking</font>

274
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,000
within the same box so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

275
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,130
create like or external loop connecting

276
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,350
or fiber between two ports in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

277
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,090

279
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:11,890
we use freedom external loop so the open

280
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,380
flow flow can go to the lacp ports so we

281
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,620
don't lose the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alessi approach that we</font>

282
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,530
have in the backbone and always have in

318

because as we are just creating this

that could be useful for everyone

network work but this might be a problem

431
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">for some of you and uh maybe you have to</font>

432
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,639
pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of pain if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

433
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this kind of partnership security</font>

434
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,510
of course you have a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

435
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,100
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the communication between the</font>

436
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:58,789
switch and the controller should be

437
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,219
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL or not and the first shot it</font>

438
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:04,789
looks like oh it's obvious let's use SSL

439
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,309
but as everything here is new the code

440
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:09,429
in the inside the switch is new the the

441
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,600
controller is near the<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications new</font>

442
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:14,179
it makes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more complicated</font>

443
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,320
for you to just use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp down for</font>

444
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,520
troubleshooting so we decide not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

445
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,730
because we have a very controlled

446
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,379
approach but also the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flows</font>

447
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,780
you have if you decide to have

448
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,570
virtualization provide and support

449
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">different users manipulating your sweets</font>

450
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,100
you need to define the amount of flows

451
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,590
of each each application can stall and

452
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,320
the flow insertion rate limit how many

453
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:42,320
flows can be served by second also all

454
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,149
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these you have to define and the</font>

455
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,158
troubleshooting again is a very

456
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,799
important topic especially if you try to

457
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:51,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">use the passive ooh in this case the</font>

458
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:55,490
switch receives the flow direct from

459
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:57,440
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux common line but we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

460
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,289
find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution to do this no secular</font>

461
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,350
probe in our case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decide to go</font>

462
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">without ssl this makes our life a little</font>

463
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:07,610
bit easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for troubleshooting because</font>

464
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,740
again everything here is new and we are

465
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:13,428
always singing things that we need to

466
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,799
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> on we limited the sliced with 4000</font>

467
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:18,230
flows all of them using later<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lay</font>

468
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:21,918
three matches we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we have them</font>

469
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:24,740
something around 306 and we limited to

470
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,900
40 flow in searches per second and today

471
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,820
we see that 15 is more than enough the

472
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,179
most part the time communication for

473
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">lldp and topology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discovery and we're</font>

474
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:37,020
still working at the troubleshooting the

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">passive way</font>

476
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,720
so now let's say that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

477
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,240
motivated to do the deployment in your

478
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">site so what kind of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

479
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,160
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention despite the all the others</font>

480
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,800
that I talk you're going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

481
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,720
skills this is the most obvious you're

482
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,550
gonna if you're just network engineer

483
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works with the network you</font>

486
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,810
have to learn a little bit about linux

487
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,880
because of the controllers<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll need</font>

488
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:09,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">to learn how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read log is and</font>

491
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,840
because most part of control is used by

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">two or java would be very useful for you</font>

493
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,790
especially for<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating troubleshooting</font>

494
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:24,510
tools for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> or sometimes to integrate</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">create your topology simulate the link</font>

500
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:38,700
speeds everything and use your external

501
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,670
application in controlling that virtual

502
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,820
virtual network but then you have to

503
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:47,040
create a physical test environment with

504
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,980
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> sue HD you have in production</font>

505
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,770
this is now fundamental part of you have

506
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,750
probably have this or as a testing

507
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,610
environment but this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

508
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:00,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that you have to keep like forever</font>

509
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:03,120
because now the new code that one

510
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">company term the stack has changed you</font>

511
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,510
have to test<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all of them you need to</font>

512
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,370
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that how that code affects</font>

513
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,379
the switch how the code affects the

514
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,360
virtualization the controller the

515
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,790
application the user interface so it's

516
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,310
very important you have this scenario

517
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:21,540
always available for you to test and of

518
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">course do it gradually don't try to to</font>

519
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,360
migrate everything in your network from

520
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">one shot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in our case we started in</font>

521
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">April 30 last year deployed everything</font>

522
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">in august 30 we develop a few tools we</font>

523
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,970
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the open</font>

524
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">flow in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> python</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linux was part of our</font>

525
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,130
routine so was not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated and</font>

526
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,640
along the supercomputer of last year we

527
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,580
had pigs of 55<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bits per second only</font>

528
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,560
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top of the open flow</font>

529
00:22:49,580 --> 00:23:00,320
faces so train your team document

530
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:02,480
everything this again seems obvious keep

531
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,280
the networking test the test environment

532
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,890
available these you have to do this

533
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,560
forever might be a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time or</font>

534
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:12,650
waste of capex but it's important to

535
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:15,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this and be prepared for surprise</font>

536
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,540
of course no vendor or switch is mistake

537
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,840
free and we have and production we have

538
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:23,300
brocade but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another we have</font>

539
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,020
other devices we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco we have</font>

540
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:29,270
juniper we have pic I ate and we have

541
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,520
seen that all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have problem so</font>

542
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:36,200
always have your disaster recovery plan

543
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,780
available so for the future we still

544
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,910
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define some methodology to test</font>

545
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:44,149
the new vendors new Suites<font color="#E5E5E5"> validator</font>

546
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:46,040
switch work valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> methodol for</font>

547
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,800
opportunity this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that we</font>

548
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">are working now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it make sure that</font>

549
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,010
the full open flow flows are forward in

550
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,870
the traffic according to what you SPECT

551
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,550
this might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be not very clear but</font>

552
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,340
sometimes the switch does not work

553
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:04,250
properly as the way you respect and we

554
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:07,010
have new applications in mind like<font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS</font>

555
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,620
control using as flow was presented on

the last open<font color="#E5E5E5"> network summit by brocade</font>

557
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,330
and we are working now<font color="#E5E5E5"> to with the</font>

558
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:18,020
Georgia Tech to establish a network

559
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:20,480
define exchange point and so we can

560
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:24,830
connect a lot of SDN islands from our

561
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,080
users through our topology so just the

562
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,600
last slide these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> results we saw</font>

563
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,730
in our network as we are an academic

567
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,140
at work and we usually are the counter a

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,150
central contract point for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

569
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,000
we have seen in the past that sometimes

00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:51,830
create a single villain can't a 512

571
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,050
eight weeks for example so the most

572
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,909
simple scenario took at least 5 days and

573
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,560
4 to create this single villain

574
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,450
sometimes it took like 10 emails

575
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,700
exchanged between the olden at work

576
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,590
involved from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a request</font>

577
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,080
from the moment

578
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,600
from this working but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had case like</font>

579
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,059
it took two weeks or eight weeks to have

580
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,639
a single villain working and more than

581
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:15,428
100<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails were exchanged so what we're</font>

582
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,070
seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that with the Sen involving</font>

583
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:21,190
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi domain protocol working</font>

584
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:23,529
fine all of these is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless a few</font>

585
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,890
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is no need for emails</font>

586
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:28,659
our users they know they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> acl's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

587
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,840
know what parts they can use they go in

588
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:35,080
our software click at any point a in the

589
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,908
point B and the network is proficient so

590
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,918
this was the one of the main

591
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:41,110
achievements for us and the second one

592
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,330
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> academic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network we are very</font>

593

594
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,990
our users researchers not just from the

595
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,490
computer in size but from arts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

596
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,039
the scene agree that works with video

597
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,720
they have access to our switch they can

598
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:57,309
do the flows according to their needs

599
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,740
they have information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about statuesque</font>

600

601
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,659
up and down but also most importantly

602
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:08,199

yeah well in our case in Miami we have

632
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:34,080
her switch is directly connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

633
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:36,539
controller but Miami was easy in some

634

following<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Chile in Chile in fact we</font>

the router from our partner to our

so far is the environments this

very restricted yeah but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know he is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

very insecure but it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best way for</font>

642
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,539
us to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the controller is</font>

643
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:08,458
saying the flows exactly the way we
