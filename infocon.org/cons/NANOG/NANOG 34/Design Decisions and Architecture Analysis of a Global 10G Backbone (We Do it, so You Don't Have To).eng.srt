1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> VJ gyal I'm senior network</font>

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,469
architect for AOL global network

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:14,129
operations and so in Vegas we were

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,259
talking at the nanog reform meeting that

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,380
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tangi backbone was fairly</font>

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,060
easy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the reasons some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,939
presentations for nanog were

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,220
quote-unquote boring and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe also</font>

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,170
quote unquote lame was the fact that

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,799
most of the heavy lifting had already

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,230
been done and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Joel Joel are you</font>

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,840
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room all right stand up and be</font>

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,790
counted so when I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the mic and</font>

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">said that building a Batman is no easy</font>

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,540
we know how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that any idiot can</font>

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,940
build one prime<font color="#CCCCCC"> example standing right</font>

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,519
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the rostrum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Joelle stood up and</font>

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,780
said that no it wasn't easy and why

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,390
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,620
background so Joe will blame him for

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,620
this so I'm looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and I'm</font>

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,089
thinking building a backbone is actually

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,018
not that hard anymore on the other hand

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,900
describing<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to build an entire</font>

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,460
backbone in 30 minutes is also hard so

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,049
what I'm going to do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,089
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the short presentation on how</font>

28
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,119
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a backbone in three slides and</font>

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,799
then we'll go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AOL</font>

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,250
implementation of one such background

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,000
and in future<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maynard's i'll probably</font>

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,549
drill down more into the specifics of of

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,220
our background design so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,220
back at my presentation on nanog 29 in

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">chicago in 2003</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> john mitchell and myself</font>

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,860
gave a talk on how we converted ospf to

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,340
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias on the AOL background so if you</font>

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:45,060
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these presentations in as one</font>

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,060
group we will lay out from the very nuts

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,119
and bolts how the backbone was designed

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> built unfortunately due to the time</font>

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,320
restrictions we can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into as</font>

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,960
much detail as I would like so I will

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,639
break it up into various presentations

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,339
and I will go into excruciating detail

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,439
on some of them including this one later

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,420
so anyway three slide background review

48
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">higher RFP engineers people that write</font>

49
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">rfps talk to the vendor say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oi run me up</font>

50
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,350
a background

51
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,380
and the vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> SC's will do the backbone</font>

52
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,180
for you this is not hyperbole there are

53
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,160
plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have built</font>

54
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,070
backbones using this exact same

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,049
methodology and as highly heightened one

56
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,440
of the original guys of<font color="#CCCCCC"> unit once said</font>

57
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,270
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want it bad you get it bad and</font>

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,840
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want a backbone in the worst</font>

59
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:44,260
possible way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was slide 1 this is</font>

60
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,260
slide to this is like three

61
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,200
unfortunately most of our

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,960
implementations have stuck at here and

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have not yet made it here but we are</font>

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:09,180
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that so one of the reasons I</font>

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,519
commented to jewel was the fact that the

66
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,020
good old days were no not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good old</font>

67
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,780
days the good old days were actually

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty horrible old days and I will give</font>

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,190
you some examples the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Union at</font>

70
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,130
architecture was called the fridge a

71
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,370
frame relay interim crutch and when your

72
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,140
backbone has the word crutch in it

73
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,820
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good the reason we had to do</font>

74
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,790
that was we did not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough packets</font>

75
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,859
per second forwarding on the cisco

76
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,810
routers at the time so we have to use

77
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like full mesh frame relay and</font>

78
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,710
ds3 s so we could get routers that would

79
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,540
talk directly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rogers over the frame</font>

80
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,890
relay circuit and not have to transit

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,750
routers because the routers could not

82
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,049
support packets per second of the

83
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,570
traffic volume at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time a 3 conchords</font>

another<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite of mine 3com ethernet</font>

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,260
kilobyte kilobytes of buffer so

87
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially you could have one packet in</font>

88
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,350
buffer and bgp tends to get very upset

89

when you try to send an up sensor<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,570
would call<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco there are several cisco</font>

engineers some of them whom<font color="#E5E5E5"> i shall not</font>

call by name but tli is one of them

95
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,859
where we would call<font color="#CCCCCC"> him up and start</font>

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,349
upgrading the background and on a good

97
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,470
day we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably get two or three</font>

code<font color="#CCCCCC"> builds as we discovered new bugs as</font>

99
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,030
we rebooted the backbone okay this

100
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,130
doesn't work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony's like I I think I</font>

broke oh I know how to fix that try this

routers that if you if they got a

105

routing update until they process the

110
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,299
here somewhere is it still true that

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,450
these problems are really here anymore

147
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:55,419
you can go to a router with a good

148
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,640
expectation that what the vendors for

149
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:02,800
pure IP forwarding that what they say

150
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,930
will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work so so these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

151
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,100
actual the horrible old days we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

152
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,100
the good old days now

153
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,500
so we I mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the last time</font>

154
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,750
I had an actual core router that ran out

155
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of packets per second I mean with ACL</font>

156
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">then filters of course there's some of</font>

157
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,360
that but fundamentally the architecture

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,860
is sound you take a bunch of routers you

159
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,160
run the latest scored on them you

160
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,700
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> them with ocx links it just kind</font>

161
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,700
of works the methodology for building

162
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,409
backbones is fairly clear now you have

163
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,969
two routers up here and do writers

164
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,460
around here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you connect them in some</font>

165
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:45,510
fashion and then roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you have a</font>

166
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:47,039
background so how did we<font color="#CCCCCC"> build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a back</font>

167
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,690
when how how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all those</font>

168
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,470
implementation details and turn them

169
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:58,040
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a back man so it remember my slide</font>

170
00:07:52,470 --> 00:08:01,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 the part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about profit revenue has</font>

171
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,990
essentially stayed flat<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphic volumes</font>

172
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,120
have grown and this is true across

173
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,870
pretty any<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pretty much any ISP that</font>

174
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,780
I've talked to at some point you have to

175
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,220
start recovering the spend your capital

176
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you put in into the network to</font>

177
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,540
sustain the volume of traffic growth you

178
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to start recovering that and the</font>

179
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,810
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start recovering that is to make</font>

180
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,510
the network more efficient and I'll go

181
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">into some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more details about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

182
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:29,070
the killer app is bandwidth that is the

183
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,530
key part I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to some people</font>

184
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,960
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Korea telecom and what they were</font>

185
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,880
saying is people really want bandwidth

186
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,229
because what bandwidth does to them is

187
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,140
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that going to run like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peer-to-peer</font>

188
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:42,840
all the time the key part<font color="#CCCCCC"> what bandwidth</font>

189
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,750
is that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduces transactional latency</font>

190
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,120
you want to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> veterans show over</font>

immediately so the transaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

196
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,610
latency because the key residual of

197
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:06,839
humanity now is time people will create

198

199
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,700
them that it reduces your transactional

200
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,110
latency you have time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the killer</font>

201
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,410
app that drives the internet not

202
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:20,160
services so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been running with like</font>

203
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,010
our backbones have been predicated on

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,890
fifty sixty five percent model

205
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,380
and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve now is</font>

206
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,600
revenue models the margins on ten

percent or lower people<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that</font>

208
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,060
IP packets are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a commodity and so so</font>

209
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,430
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're their commodity doesn't</font>

210
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,709
mean you can't make money if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">quote-unquote a commodity oil which has</font>

215
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:54,319
been equality for many many tens of

216
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:56,120
years all that stuff means that the

217
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,390
backbone must have minimum touch and

218
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,850
your OSS and network<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring systems</font>

219
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,160
are competitive advantages everybody

buys the same equipment you go to like

what give me a co-writer we will you go

225
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,910
to level three you would request you go

to like global<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossing and say give me</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a bunch of lambdas you hook them up</font>

228
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:29,000
together pretty much modulo 5 10 points

229
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,319
you get the same discounts across the

230
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,990
hardware you get the same discounts

231
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,710
across line cards so your cogs your cost

232
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,720
of goods sold your capital spend on the

233
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,940
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same across</font>

234
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,410
the board their minor cost basis

235
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,420
differences for example if you own your

236
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,880
fiber versus buying fiber but the

237
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:51,050
margins are about two to three five ten

238
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,050
percent on those services so the cogs

239
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,609
for any backbone is the same so where

240
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,439
will you get the competitive advantage

241
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,420
to survive the competitive advantage

242
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,740
will be your provisioning your OSS your

243
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:05,870
NMS real options these are not the

244
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,420
options that that fuels the stock boom

245
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,300
these are there's the actual theory and

246
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,979
science of real<font color="#E5E5E5"> options and i probably</font>

247
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,500
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not go into that because it's it's</font>

248
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,810
long the key part here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that today</font>

249
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,940
market uncertainty is high so basically

250
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:26,119
what we want is experimentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

251

services that deliver value built on<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,890
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is simple and can</font>

we've distilled down to our supporting

256
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:44,000
real-time voice because pretty much

257
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,800
everything else above that works if you

258
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,140
can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> voice work everything will just</font>

259
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:53,150
fall out for free so what the a while

260
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:58,250
back one has been done has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been designed</font>

00:11:53,150 --> 00:12:00,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is provide a good service and let</font>

265
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,469
quarters and they roll them<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the</font>

266
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,620
backbone they roll them<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the edges</font>

267
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,600
and see which sticks this is a theory if

268
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,190
you throw enough past at the wall once

269
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,710
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the strands will stick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

270
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:23,330
the wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know the bastards done</font>

271
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:26,240
so we try Richard is here I know he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

272
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">very well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> held the philosophy that we</font>

273
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">should not put anything in the backbone</font>

274
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,870
that we can do at the edges so instead

275
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of spending capital on making the</font>

276
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,210
backbone look like a TDM<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network trying</font>

277
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,959
to impose TDM semantics<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto our packet</font>

278
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:44,420
backbones the real capital spend should

279
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,780
be put into making the applications more

280
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,370
resilient because eventually you can

281
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,810
take the application you can leverage

282
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">the work you put into the application</font>

283
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:56,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">and leverage across the entire internet</font>

284
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,310
for example I mean my entire job is to

285
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,170
make sure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that I'm not needed</font>

286
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,930
at the company that the backbone runs

287
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,839
without me and if it makes business

288
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,180
sense that AOL can just turn the back

292
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,750
applications still work because in the

293
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,729
end run AOL is not here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,070

295
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,350
AOL here is to return value<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

296
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,910
shareholders and the way to return value

297
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to shareholders is to make sure that</font>

298
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,900
whatever services they offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and charge</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody else so for aol's perspective</font>

303
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:46,880
the holistic companies spend should be

304
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,370
better spent on making applications more

305
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,340
resilient rather than imposing tedium

306
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,500
semantics on packet background so that

307
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,520
all being said this is what the AOL

308
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,960
Backman looks like it's a it provides

309

AOL Time Warner facility

310

interconnections<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet connectivity</font>

311
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,190
for Time Warner Cable data centers and

312
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,170
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly simple simple</font>

313
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,370
design you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go into that just</font>

314
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,969
because it's simple doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that</font>

315
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,460
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no traffic on it I don't know if</font>

316
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this properly or the green</font>

318
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:28,040
it to me for sometimes I'm some time ago

319
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,079
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked it very much this is</font>

320
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,699
actually an artifact of our London built

321
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,400
where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had a little bit of</font>

322
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">double counting going on before we took</font>

323
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,740
all the riders out of DNS however the

324
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,010
actual back one growth is right about

325
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,410
250 g this is single counted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

326
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,350
shown like<font color="#CCCCCC"> variants of the slide earlier</font>

327
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,300
on for example mine a<font color="#E5E5E5"> NOC 26</font>

328
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,920
presentation at Eugene I showed at that

329
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,589
point the back one had<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone up to like</font>

330
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,930
80 gigs of traffic and so in about three

331
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:59,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">years we've gone from 75 gigs to about</font>

332
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,489
250 gigs of traffic this is single

333
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">counted so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a marketing</font>

334
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,700
number so since the backbone does not

335
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:10,310
consume or generate traffic any bit that

336
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,740
goes in also goes out so if you just

337
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,359
count the bits coming into the backbone

338
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have an accurate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of the traffic</font>

339
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,930
traversing the background and currently

340
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:22,640
it's about at 95th percentile 250 gig so

341
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,170
there's some volume to it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

342
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about like a design Network</font>

343
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,890
sitting in my in my lab that that can

344
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,320
talk all these fancy theories about real

345
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,230
options on this is actual real money

346
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,110
being spent here so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the</font>

347
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,150
traffic kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looks like the 50</font>

348
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,650
gigabit of edge traffic actually is 250

349
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:44,510
gigabits veg traffic i was editing the

350
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:48,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides and managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bollix that up so</font>

351
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:51,980
these are things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause that 250</font>

352
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,560
gigs of traffic these this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

353
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,140
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that supports that</font>

354
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,250
traffic so there's actual real cost

355
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,740
basis

356
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:05,450
do this it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network these</font>

357
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:07,850
are the applications we run on it 703

358
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:11,410
7.3 million active users these are stats

359
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:15,260
as of like couple of couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks ago</font>

360
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,060
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually run every bit</font>

361
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,050
that goes over the diagram service goes

362
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,750
over the background so there is

363
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,969
substantial amount of real real users on

364
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,470
it and they become very irate even

365
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:30,220
though they are free if the if there are

366
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:33,740
any issues with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background so now</font>

367
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,880
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> backbone is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> financial issue I</font>

368
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,220

369
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,290
build vanity backbones but this is no

370
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,810
longer 99 we no longer have enough

371
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:47,240
capacity to throw around so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

are how<font color="#CCCCCC"> a well breaks down the cost</font>

375
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,790
allocations we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't set this policy our</font>

376
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:03,280
corporate financial spoke set policy we

377
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:06,349
just design our backbone with regards to

378
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:10,970
satisfying these policy decisions set by

379
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:12,290
corporate and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the end reason</font>

380
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,850
is the fact that it's hard to sell

381
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,470
services on your switches are locked<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

382
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:20,510
non confirmed cages across the world so

383
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,819
when we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go up and build the</font>

384
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,010
backbone we decided to look at things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

385
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:29,030
can we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy capacity from somebody</font>

386
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:31,820
else like level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 and how would that</font>

387
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:35,629
work over the long period of time versus

388
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,700
going out buying fiber buying lambdas

389
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,890
buying routers and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

390
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:44,930
associated SG&A to support all that

391
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:46,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure so according</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

392
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,380
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the previous slide we</font>

393
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,180
basically run an npv marble which we

394
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,370
take the cash flow out and run it back

395
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,830
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present time and see if it gives us a</font>

396
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,739
payback and we weigh the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of capital</font>

397
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,449
because cash loses value over time so we

weigh<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost of capital put that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

402
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,250
there's this little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fudge factor</font>

403
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,810
in there

404
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,100
the training<font color="#CCCCCC"> for periods of months</font>

405
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,770
because there are some services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

can<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> controller own destiny but</font>

407
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,379
mostly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the New World Order we have to</font>

408
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,209
justify every bit of spend on the

409
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:29,220
backbone and these are the models that

410
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,540
we use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> justify the span and so this</font>

411
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the backbone looks like it's a</font>

412
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:37,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit out of date there's a NOC 768</font>

413
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,919
STM 256 or 40 gigabit link now up

414
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,260
between some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our to our data centers</font>

415
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,800
and I haven't turned that in here and

416
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:48,030
Europe looks slightly<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're more</font>

417
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">s'more circus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there than Andrew looks</font>

418
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:56,180
like so it's a backbone spans four

419
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:58,470
continents 10 gigabit Backman links and

420
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,790
more circuits are coming in<font color="#CCCCCC"> but haven't</font>

421
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:07,980
shown them here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so design philosophy</font>

422
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Susan how are we doing on time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

423
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:15,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to speed up please hold all</font>

424
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:17,280
questions till the end the entire

425
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,080
backbone is actually I was making a dig

426
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,820
at RFP engineers but the entire

427
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,470
background is built designed in-house

428
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,780
because we have a philosophy if you

429
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,060
don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run and design and</font>

430
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">operate it and it's a core business</font>

431
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:33,330
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably find</font>

432
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:36,629
another job so everything for the

433
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,270
backbone is done in-house the design

434
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,650
criteria are of course the standard no

435
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">single points of failure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> redundant</font>

436
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,180
capacity to support peak load and the

437
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,160
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is run on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a router</font>

438
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,550
topology for now we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

439
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,050
mpls enabled and ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll out and</font>

440
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,500
in case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had we have also rolled out</font>

441
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:57,840
some some small services using<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp but i</font>

442
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,630
will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into that today because no</font>

443
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,580
time and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do is every</font>

444
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,590
quarter we have in a complete system

445
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,560
review where we take our traffic matrix

446
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,510
and impose it on our on our current

447
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,419
topology and then we fail various

448
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:15,570
components we fail links nodes routers

449
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,780
we fail data centers and see how that

450
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,560
traffic mapping occurs on the backbone

451
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,879
to make sure that we have enough

452
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:26,470
capacity to continue on

453
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:29,110
providing service so the entire back one

454
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,550
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very standards-based it's consistent</font>

455
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,459
because one of the things we learned

456
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:37,090
earlier was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you're running</font>

458
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:43,030
architecture should remain the same it's

459
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,490
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four boxes connected in a</font>

463
00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:00,219
if it looks consistent it makes hiring

464
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:03,040
new employees easier because there are

465
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,140
no gotchas there are no exceptions to

466
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,290
the side<font color="#E5E5E5"> because oh that site is</font>

471
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,770
why this particular static route is

sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network there's almost</font>

none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that I mean this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a real</font>

475
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,600
some local optimizations we have but

476
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,510
everything we've done is try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

477
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:33,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind the technological curve we are</font>

478
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:34,690
not interested in this being a sexy<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

480
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,950
since this being rocket science because

481
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,750
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are not rocket scientists here</font>

482
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,200
so it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be simple so we can</font>

483
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,740
understand it and what this allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

484
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,360
do is automate stuff automate the stuff

485
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,760
and push it out into things like the NOC

486
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,010
which have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly high turnover rate I</font>

487
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,720
don't know if they're any operators here

488
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,220
with like large knocks but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Knox</font>

489
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,320
traditionally see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the highest</font>

490
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,290
turnover rates of any single

491
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,820
organization within a company and

492
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,530
outside of customer service<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course so</font>

493
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,300
the things have to be simple they have

494
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,040
to look the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you push them</font>

495
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,780
into the knock and within a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year about</font>

496
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,570
thirty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your staff will leave</font>

497
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,340
and your your training you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending a</font>

498
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,870
lot of time training new people and

499
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,459
bringing them up to speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if it looks</font>

500
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,669
the same across the board it's easier

501
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,670
that way

502
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,200
so again holding back to that philosophy

503
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's no rocket science in the network</font>

504
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,120
anywhere the routing policy is based in

505
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,220
very simple metrics the entire focus of

506
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,379
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backbone has been to reduce</font>

507
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,030
operational expenditure again it's not

508
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,470
about building a network that is cool

509
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,040
it's got building a network that works

510
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:46,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's simple so here's the logical</font>

511
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,080
design of the backbone this is like one

512
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,240
of our there's another link coming

513
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,699
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country and 40 gigs here I</font>

514
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't shown but the key part here is</font>

515
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,970
to watch this space and I will go into

516
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,710
that later<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a European portion of</font>

517
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,970
the network the color codes are

518
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,700
different vendors that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use for our</font>

519
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:09,780
our background and you will notice that

520
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">we try to go across different paths in</font>

521
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the country using different vendors so</font>

522
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,510
any particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> single point of failure</font>

523
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,510
doesn't completely screw the

524
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,160
connectivity up the the key part here is

525
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,080
that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to run out of pads</font>

526
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,880
across the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as we add more</font>

527
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,949
and more traffic you get to the point

528
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,890
where you either have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doubling</font>

529
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,510
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> capacity on on these links and then</font>

530
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,820
obviously you have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

531
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">capacity and then double it up across</font>

532
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,550
these links so with the current three

533
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,379
paths situation and soon to be four

534
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,480
paths you can take any one circuit

535
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:46,530
failure and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three diverse</font>

536
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,080
vendor and physical pads across the

537
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,120
nation however after the fourth path

538
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,919
things start to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> harder and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

539
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,330
are for cost-effective paths of course

540
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,530
you could buy like exorbitant prices

541
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:01,260
from AT&T but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not going to do that</font>

542
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,760
so the cost basis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network now</font>

543
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,740
doubles<font color="#E5E5E5"> because essentially what you're</font>

544
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,500
doing is you're buying bundled links so

545
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,710
the fifth path save example we buy a

546
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:14,210
fifth path across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back country here</font>

547
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:16,560
we will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy an equivalent path</font>

548
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,530
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country here so your cost</font>

549
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,840
basis for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross-country circuits just</font>

550
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,030
doubled because now we are failing them

551
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,270
over as bundles of two so instead of n

552
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:30,210
plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 redundancy now we have three two</font>

553
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,889
one or two to one redundancy so this

554
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:35,490
becomes starts to look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ass one at</font>

555
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:37,770
BLS our ring again the standard hub

556
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,600
you have big routers up top there<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

557
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:43,889
to rush the backbone edge routers at the

558
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,439
bottom it's a two level hierarchy<font color="#CCCCCC"> edgen</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">backs and SG&A and currently we are</font>

561
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,590
over-provisioning bandwidth but<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

562
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,178
spoke to this slide earlier at some

563
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,250
point we'll have to start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

564
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,929
traffic engineering techniques because

565
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:02,240
of the fact that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of</font>

566
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:02,240
viable paths to fail the backbone over

567
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,178
the key part here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the</font>

568
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,530
edge and core contrary<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like what our</font>

569
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,480
vendors are trying to tell us telling us

570
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,760
one giant box that will replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

571
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,740
entire pop the agent course still for

now tend to do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do different</font>

573
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,670
things so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an interface</font>

574
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,120
at the core and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have an</font>

575
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,740
interface at the edge and depending on

576
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,070
various business and technological

577
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,600
imperatives we can switch out the core

578
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,240
and we can switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the edge at</font>

579
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,699
different times as long as the interface

580
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,210
presented remains the same so we can

581
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,380
replace technology depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on whatever</font>

582
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,750
imperative it is that make sense at the

583
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:48,780
time so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> involve the back one in</font>

584
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:50,820
pieces so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you looked at the logical</font>

585
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,899
design the evil Corps transit network

586
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,399
consists<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a few large hubs what</font>

587
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">this does is it reduces the number of</font>

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">transit paths in the network there's</font>

589
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:03,210
only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of three ways you can go across</font>

592
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:12,120
it removes a combinatorial pads so you

593
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,740
only have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> one or two best ways to</font>

594
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,809
get across the backbone and you either

595
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,190
have them or you don't so this makes the

596
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">background fairly simple to traffic</font>

597
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,600

598
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,340

601
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:32,820
goes there and there it's simple because

we are simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> people routing</font>

604
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,610
extremely lean<font color="#CCCCCC"> there like only a couple</font>

00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:43,170
of hundred real the routes in is is

606
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,300
consisting mostly of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> backbone</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">i will</font>

610
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,669
get to that and how we how we did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

611
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,549
explained the cost structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

excruciating detail in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano</font>

613
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,090
presentation but essentially we've

614
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:02,739
broken it down to local regional

615
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,779
long-haul international pretty much

616

every is be independently comes to the

617
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,659
same conclusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this is a</font>

618
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:11,860
cost-based cost-based metric assignment

619
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:14,260
you want to keep traffic local if

620
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:19,090
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to use wet fiber the</font>

621
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:22,870
least and the long haul slightly less

622
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:25,689
and then local you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care so</font>

623
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:28,059
we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> no protected rings at the sonnet</font>

624
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:30,490
level all we do is we take lambdas

625
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:32,470
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no matter how protected a ring</font>

626
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,140
is eventually they will groom it<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

627
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:43,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same gon do it they'll groom it onto</font>

628
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:47,169
the same fiber and then owned so one

629
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:48,970
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you noticed is that we have the</font>

630
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:54,039
matrix of<font color="#E5E5E5"> city pier flows that tell us</font>

631
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:56,409
how how our traffic goes and macro flows

632
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:58,029
the law of<font color="#E5E5E5"> large numbers is makes our</font>

633
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:00,340
flow tractable we can pretty much

634
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:03,309
predict day-to-day week-to-week how

635
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:05,529
traffic will flow across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backbone</font>

636
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:07,779
traffic wants to go from the same places

637
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:10,539
to the other to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other same places on</font>

638
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,070
a fairly consistent basis so this makes

639
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:14,049
traffic engineering fairly simple

640
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,840
because we have aggregated all our

641
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:18,520
traffic we are this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

heavy-tailed in general what is saying

645
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:30,399
for what I'm saying is for our traffic

646
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:34,000
planning purposes the macro flows are

647
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,100
tractable and of course the viscosity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

648
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">bandwidth that the edge is extremely</font>

649
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,439
extremely high so the edge provisioning

anybody who's got in the circuit

651

appearing circuit from AT&T and knows

652
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,219
I'm speaking truth here it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

653
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,710
amazing amount of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn up</font>

put full edge packet filtering the key

665
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:19,320
part here is packet filtering every

666
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,749
packet that comes into the backbone of

667
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,299
the edge is run through a filter and the

668
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:27,210
filter of course filters things like a

669
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:29,158
well infrastructure space as a source IP

670
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:31,529
address because no aerial infrastructure

671
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,340
space should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be coming into AOL as a</font>

672
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:39,389
source and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we do our C 1918</font>

673
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:41,189
filtering blah blah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers actually</font>

674
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:43,469
this goes back to my first presentation

675
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,480
i gave gave at lane odd we still do

676
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:49,470
course filtering at the edges for our

677
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:54,090
peers and we use es pass filter to not

678
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:55,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">es pass filters maximum prefix is using</font>

the course sanity check for our peers

682
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:05,129
routes that they announce us we have a

large rdb that that filters the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer</font>

00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:13,949
thank you so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the op x a</font>

685
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:18,239
well some reason is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly large</font>

686
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:19,980
target for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hackers um so we used to get</font>

687
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:23,429
like paged all the time because the

688
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,379
routers were getting d dost so we worked

689
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:27,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">with our fine vendors this also goes</font>

690
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:29,609
back to my nanog<font color="#CCCCCC"> eugene presentation and</font>

691
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:32,700
other presentations I've done where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

692
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:34,559
need to harden the infrastructure and so

693
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,659
we have things so finally we got things

694
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,730
like receive a cackles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and IP firewall</font>

695
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:41,609
filters by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm using cisco</font>

696
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,580
syntax because this is for compactness

697
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:46,830
purposes we the junipers have the exact

698
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,320
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy is applied there just longer</font>

699
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it's not like a bias against any</font>

700
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,789
particular vendor we have both vendors

701
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,970
in our background we got to have foundry

702
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:58,889
not in the background though so we put

703
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,509
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lesson and even</font>

704
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:02,609
though they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not perfect cuz what i</font>

705
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:05,039
really want is this filtering to be done

706
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:08,340
at the right after the framer on the

707
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,850
line cards this is good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough quote</font>

708
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:14,750
unquote for now that it we barely bother

709
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,879
responding to dos attacks in

710
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,990
gigabyte range now because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

711
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,210
background noise and if you actually

712
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,310
cared we would be spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> all our time</font>

713
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,680
working those issues so these things

714
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,830
have allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to actually take some of</font>

715
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> s DNA we were spending on</font>

716
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,320
protecting our infrastructure away and

717
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:35,060
put them to better<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like for</font>

718
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,710
example giving talks at nanog this part

719
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,530
is non-trivial this is the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put</font>

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:41,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it up because when we did this filter we</font>

721
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:45,350
completely forgot about<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp collision</font>

722
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:48,800
detection so we put the filter in<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font>

723
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:51,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">any any equal 179 all good turned it on</font>

724
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,770
half our<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers shouldn't come up hmm</font>

725
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:57,950
what happened Oh depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how the</font>

726
00:31:54,770 --> 00:32:00,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp collision detection algorithm</font>

727
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,420
resolves chances are pretty good about

728
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,520
half the time your peer will have the

729
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,740
source<font color="#CCCCCC"> code of 179 and your destination</font>

730
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,379
as in a formal port and half the time

731
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the other way around so we had</font>

732
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,010
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the second line and let so</font>

733
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,850
that you could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up earrings up</font>

734
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:19,340
important and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we have ospf any</font>

735
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,889
any this is only for routers inside the

736
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,600
backbone we deny packets coming into the

737
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:29,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">back room that have any ospf in them</font>

738
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:33,830
from egress links so so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we</font>

739
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,960
put routes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp the goals were</font>

740
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,699
minimal manual intervention and it

741
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,470
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be flexible we want we don't want</font>

742
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,260
customer we don't want engineer to sit

743
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:45,140
sit there type in router bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and 68</font>

744
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">network blah netmask blah because they</font>

745
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,090
tend to fat<font color="#CCCCCC"> finger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those kind of things</font>

746
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,220
and we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> some outages using ospf</font>

747
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,070
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed to fat finger the</font>

748
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:58,490
netmask so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we implemented</font>

749
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:01,220
our redistribution we redistribute

750
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:04,250
connected and redistribute static into

751
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,170
into bgp into ibgp using these route

752
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,700
maps and these route maps have certain

753
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:11,090
policy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will go into in a second</font>

754
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:14,300
here and the key part here is the fact

755
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:16,520
that now any raw any engineer can go to

756
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,430
the backbone turn up an interface turn

757
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,650
up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier turn up a statically routed</font>

758
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:24,290

00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,310

<font color="#CCCCCC">the topic for another another nail art</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">non-intuitive this stands are takes care</font>

769
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,680
of public exchange points where we are

770
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,150
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to take those</font>

771
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,860
routes and give them to peers because

772
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,810
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already are either connected to</font>

773
00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:00,290
that exchange point or the exchange

774
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:01,790
point is announcing those prefixes but

775
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,680
you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send them to the</font>

776
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,510
customers so they can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

777
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,330
trace route through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange or</font>

778
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:12,820
trace route to the exchange so what

779
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:15,319
happens is we we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these are</font>

780
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,450
exchange point prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're put into</font>

781
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this prefix list and then we tag them</font>

782
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:22,069
with a separate community<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2xxx so they</font>

783
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,449
don't go to peers but they do go to

784
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,450
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the standard of</font>

785
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:28,129

786
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:30,409
is that we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this way this route</font>

787
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,480
came from and we set the local<font color="#CCCCCC"> pref high</font>

788
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,920
because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons of consistent</font>

all said and done how did we do traffic

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off here is a cost per bit of major</font>

807
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:27,140
normally as your fixed cost basis goes

down and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the thing all ISPs are</font>

familiar with this is called margin

00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:35,510
squeeze as this goes down your SG&A

811
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:38,570
tends to go up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a percentage</font>

of making an STM one was the bandwidth

818
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,980
a little bit as opposed to just staying

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing pretty good on that</font>

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">all said and done we ran into due to our</font>

822
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,020
redistribution into a BGP we ran into a

823
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,549
fairly obscure condition I see Richard

824
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,960
is smiling this is when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> bollixed</font>

825
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Milan completely up so this is milan we</font>

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,950
are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> making redundancy here but</font>

827
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,060
at that time we did not so this

828
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:27,210
particular router has a bearing on this

829
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:30,540
interface which is a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> tier 1 IV in</font>

830
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,790
the US this router was the router under

831
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,160
maintenance so we took this particular

832
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:39,540
router without turning the peering off

833
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,509
on this router what happened was so if

834
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,750
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you see that the peering</font>

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:51,690
interface the 226 interface is Rita is

836
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:57,960
on Milan and to get to Milan<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get the</font>

838
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,540
shut down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router in Zurich we did</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down the peering the reach</font>

840
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:09,120
ability for milan in is is went away

841
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,549
immediately because ISS converged on the

842
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,560
order of a second or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and since we</font>

843
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,960
take our<font color="#CCCCCC"> a level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space and nail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up on</font>

844
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,110
all our background routers the next top

845
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,970
of all all the prefixes like 40,000

846
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:24,390
prefixes that were in Milan were now

847
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:27,270
reachable from every router locally so

848
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:30,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what happened ID peerage ability</font>

849
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:35,430
from milan goes away<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibgp has not timed</font>

850
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,780
out the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop is now local so all the</font>

851
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:41,089
routers say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can get to all those</font>

852
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,090
prefixes by an internal cost of zero

853
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:49,640
what happened vgb<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in your base</font>

854
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:53,180
killing all your routes and our pagers

855
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:55,640
went insane because we lost i don't know

856
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,759
like 40 50 60 thousand sub just went

857
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,150
away because we black hold the entire

858
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,740
prefix list coming from that fear

859
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:07,250
unfortunately the problem was that now

860
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,200
this particular prefix set of prefixes

861
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,829
were reachable with an igp cost of zero

862
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,660
from all the routers any<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home</font>

863
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:17,900
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who were quote-unquote</font>

864
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-home by connecting to tier 1 a and</font>

865
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,990
p r1 be work now also reachable why a

866
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:26,118
shorter distance from tier 1 a so people

867
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:28,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">who are multi-home still got black holes</font>

868
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,069
so in fact we black hold more traffic

869
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,900
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were actually sending to their</font>

870
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:34,700
particular peer at the time because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

871
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,990
also took all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> multisim traffic and</font>

872
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:41,270
sent it to that particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer as well</font>

873
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:44,750
so lessons learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how we</font>

874
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:47,900
mitigated it in is is we implemented a

875
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:51,859
redistribute static route using this

876
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:53,540
particular policy and this is what the

877
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:58,400
particular policy looks like this is all

878
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:01,040
AOL backbone loopback<font color="#E5E5E5"> space we take that</font>

879
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,660
policy description really get black

880
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,180
holing when edge next up dies without

881
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:10,399
being withdrawn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibgp yes and we put</font>

882
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,899
this route we took this and put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

883
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,849
two routers at the far side of the

884
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,760
network so that in case this happens

885
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:20,680
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp is for that particular</font>

886
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:24,170
background link is still resolvable at a

887
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:31,270
higher cost than then the null 0 oops

888
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:31,270
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we are done any questions</font>
