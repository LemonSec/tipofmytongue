my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe ably this is going to be</font>

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,490
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick talk so anybody who's</font>

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,200
hungry can probably just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hang on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute so I'll gloss over some of these</font>

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,559
first slides most people here probably

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,940
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what PGP is and if you don't know</font>

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,640
what pgps and there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really enough</font>

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,080
time to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you while I'm here it's a</font>

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,570
general purpose tool for encrypting

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,669
stuff and signing stuff and the

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,550
important point for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the purpose of this</font>

12
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,439
brief presentation is that for pgp to be

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,660
really useful there needs to be a good

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,270
way of accessing a trusted set of public

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,770
keys for people you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send</font>

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">data to or for signatures you're trying</font>

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,230
to verify so verifying the keys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

18
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:46,230
have are accurate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trusted as</font>

19
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,550
an important part of PGP another sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,260
cornerstone of this presentation is

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,940
thing called the web of trust which

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,399
means you don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have</font>

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,789
verified personally another key in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font>

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,219
to be able to trust it you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly</font>

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,570
have trusted one key by some personal

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,699
interaction with the owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that key</font>

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">and because they have done a similar</font>

28
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">exercise towards somebody else you have</font>

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,949
a path through this web of trust to be

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,090
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust that remote key which</font>

31
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,580
might be owned<font color="#CCCCCC"> by somebody that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,290
never met so in effect you're using

33
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,330
somebody that you have met as a trusted

34
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,770
introducer towards somebody else which

35
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,039
allows PGP to be much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more useful</font>

36
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,789
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> means you can use it towards</font>

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,560
destinations that you haven't actually

38
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:28,619
personally verified so this web of trust

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,720
is can be expanded by<font color="#E5E5E5"> general key</font>

40
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,640
signing between two people anywhere any

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,610
PGP users you don't need to do a pgp

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,950
signing party but quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> often people get</font>

43
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,689
together in a little group in order to

44
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">have what's called a pgp key signing</font>

45
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,829
party usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> without beer not a very</font>

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,200
good party in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

47
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,759
dense set the dense set of

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,159
interconnections in this web of trust to

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,890
make PGP generally more useful in some

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,810
efficient way so the general steps of a

51
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,719
pgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> cubed key signing party that's four</font>

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,509
steps the first step is to verify

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,820
fingerprints so a fingerprint is a bit

54
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,479
like an md5 hash many cases it is a 75

55
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,459
hash in some sense so you have a copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,440
a public key fingerprint on a piece of

57
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,930
paper somebody reads it out

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,609
the owner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that key verifies that what</font>

59
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,260
was read out corresponds to their

60
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,540
personal trusted knowledge of what the

61
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,640
fingerprint should be and everybody else

62
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">can make a note of the fact that the</font>

63
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,500
owner of the key confirmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the peed</font>

64
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fingerprint was accurate so this is</font>

65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first page first stage fingerprint</font>

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,860
verification the next important step

67
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,300
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite important and it's quite</font>

68
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,160
often ignored by people who do this kind

69
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,690
of thing without thinking is to verify

70
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,000
that the person who said yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

71
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,270
fingerprint is accurate is actually the

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,740
person whose name is on the key so it's

73
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,150
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> random guy saying yes the</font>

74
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,890
fingerprint is accurate even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you see</font>

75
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,510
him checking if it's not his key<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

76
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,790
you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have much to go on as</font>

77
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,410
far as trusting<font color="#E5E5E5"> like he goes so checking</font>

78
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,440
the identity of the person who verifies

79
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,400
the key is also important so common ways

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,750
of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this are checking</font>

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,780
government-issued photo ID driver's

82
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,920
licenses passports that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing</font>

83
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,000
sometimes you can gain some sort of

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,649
knowledge of the identity of the person

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,390
by looking at other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

86
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,550
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same room and how they react to</font>

87
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,559
them you might say if I know these five

88
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,000
high-profile person people in the room

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,430
and this other guy has got a big

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">important name that I recognize and they</font>

91
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,030
all don't react badly when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he says he is</font>

92
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">who he says he is maybe I can infer</font>

93
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,420
something from that so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

94
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,820
ways of doing it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of the day</font>

95
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,679
it's it's up to the individual to choose

96
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:37,890
a method that suits them but photo ID is

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,570
a common one the next step is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

98
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,130
that information you have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

99
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,530
trustworthiness of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a particular public</font>

100
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,840
key and record digitally the fact that

101
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,970
that trusted trust exists and you do

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,660
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> by signing a public key with York</font>

103
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,830
with your private key so in practice the

104
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,720
way you do this is you obtain each

105
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,700
public key you generate the fingerprint

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,769
of the key you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you just downloaded</font>

107
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,940
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare it with this piece of</font>

108
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,709
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you took away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the key</font>

109
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,630
signing party and if they're the same

110
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you can probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be confident to</font>

111
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the public here you pull down is</font>

112
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,440
accurate and then you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply a</font>

113
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,440
signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

114
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,478
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very last part is to take that</font>

115
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,009
signature and spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

116
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">world so it can be used by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other people</font>

117
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,340
if you keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to yourself then you're</font>

118
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,039
not really enlarging anybody else's

119
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're web of trust if you send the key</font>

120
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,190
out with your signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it than other</font>

121
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,139
people can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and they can use any</font>

122
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,340
trust they might have of your key to

123
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,320
allow them to trust other keys they

124
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,698
haven't personally verified so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,500
the four steps this is a key signing

126
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:41,020
party now the problems when the parties

127
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,000
get big fingerprint verification of

128
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,948
scales linearly so if you have n people

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,389
you have n people to read out keys

130
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:48,370
everybody compares them on the piece of

131
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,030
paper at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time so that scales</font>

132
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,009
relatively in a controlled fashion

133
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,409
identity verification is quite often

134
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:57,699
quadratic because quite often what

135
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,110
happens is one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> holds up their</font>

136
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,270
passport and shows it to everybody else

137
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,099
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room so if you have 10 people in</font>

138
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,448
the party then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have each person</font>

139
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:05,740
showing their ID to nine different

140
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,270
people and there's a delay what each

141
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,580
person looks at the looks of the ID and

142
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,020
as the party gets bigger and bigger that

143
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem gets gets bigger and bigger and</font>

144
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,090
the party becomes more and more tedious

145
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:18,909
the exercise of signing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys and</font>

keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key signing party so that's not</font>

148
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:28,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a rate-limiting step in making a</font>

149
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:29,740
key signing party efficient so at nan

150
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,680
logs we've had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other problems which</font>

151
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,000
are not necessarily technical ones the

152
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,320
slot that we've usually had to have a

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,830
key signing party n has been late on

154
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,449
Monday night which overlaps with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp</font>

SEC bots<font color="#CCCCCC"> buff which usually overruns</font>

because it's good one and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,760
interrupts have people's dinners and you

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,110
know half the people are drunk and stuff

159
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,610
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not very handy other</font>

160
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,470
problems we have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people submit</font>

161
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,900
their public keys late and they turn up

162
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,949
saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just submitted it just now but</font>

163
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,969
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's far too late for it to</font>

appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the signature</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sheet so that</font>

165
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,750
slows everything up people show up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

166
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,889
they expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to read the</font>

167
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,630
trusted fingerprint off the piece of

00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">paper that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just got given by some</font>

169
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,949
random guy which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not very useful</font>

170
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,659
people don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what PGP is</font>

171
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,970
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if they just turn up and</font>

172
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:15,130
see if they can join in which also

173
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,330
doesn't work and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we only have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one key</font>

174
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,949
signing party then there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

175
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">chance for people to get all this stuff</font>

176
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,729
right which tends to mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the</font>

177
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,280
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> already established users of</font>

178
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,109
PGP that get to play

179
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,789
which in effect all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people already</font>

180
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,669
sign each other's keys the web of trust

181
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:35,220
doesn't get any bigger there's an

182
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,979
efficient group key signing method which

183
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,710
was described by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lance assmann which</font>

184
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,000
attempts to make the hexadecimal part of

185
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,280
the exercise a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> des</font>

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
tedious which involves making a big

187
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,330
sheet of fingerprints taking an md5 hash

188
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,169
of it and having everybody download

189
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,370
their own copy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> compare the hash it</font>

190
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,810
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually address the identity</font>

191
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,340
verification problem at all though and

192
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,300
that's the step that<font color="#E5E5E5"> champ tends to take</font>

193
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:03,869
the most time so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are my conclusions</font>

194
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,290
big key signing parties are tedious big

195
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:11,310
tedious parties at nano<font color="#E5E5E5"> get difficult</font>

196
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,960
having more parties would be better so

197
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,000
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try this time</font>

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,469
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having one big party on</font>

199
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monday night which is only attended by</font>

200
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,910
drunk people or existing users of PGP we

201
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,919
have a much larger number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of smaller</font>

202
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,139
parties and we hold them throughout the

203
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,430
two days and you can pretty much attend

204
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,960
any single party and get the full

205
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,280
benefit of the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so if you</font>

206
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,289
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be busy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in one break doesn't</font>

207
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,119
matter you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the next one if you</font>

208
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,860
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forget to submit your key on</font>

209
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,789
Sunday it doesn't matter you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it</font>

210
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,229
on monday and go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on Tuesday</font>

211
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:42,840
so the general idea is we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

212
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,120
reduce this kind of thing here which is

213
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,500
a very tedious red diagram into this

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,100
which is a very very pleasant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

215
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,500
calming blue diagram so the orange and

216
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the and the brown dots are people who</font>

217
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,340
attend all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parties and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are act</font>

218
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,479
as introduces towards the rest of them

219
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,400
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody for example in the bottom</font>

220
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,510
left can contrast a key from somebody

221
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,560
else in a different party on the bottom

222
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,419
right because the signatures of those

223
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:11,400
mr. orange and mr. Brown allow that that

224
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:13,469
they had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen so what we're</font>

225
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing we're having he signing parties in</font>

226
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,450
the last 10 to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 minutes of the brakes</font>

227
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,280
and at lunch in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the terminal room which</font>

228
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:24,390
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just outside here behind the big pgp</font>

229
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,950
key signing sign what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been doing is</font>

230
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,360
printing<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a daily set the fingerprint</font>

231
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,280
sheet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this does one this morning</font>

232
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,930
there'll be another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one tomorrow so if</font>

233
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,240
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to participate you basically</font>

234
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,400
show up bring a pen photo ID and a

235
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,960
trusted copy of your fingerprint and you

236
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,299
can come to any one of those parties

237
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,460
and it should work and we had the first

238
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,780
one just in the break before this little

239
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,760
session here we have seven people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

240
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,910
took about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was tell</font>

241
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:58,760
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and that's it any</font>

242
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:58,760
questions nope thank you this is lunch
