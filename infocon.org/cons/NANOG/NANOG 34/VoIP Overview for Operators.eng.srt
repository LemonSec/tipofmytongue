basically do an enum look up an enum

143
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,640
basically does the corresponding

144
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:31,680
translation and sip then those were to

145
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,479
basically direct the call something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

146
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,620
want to briefly touch on is public enum

147
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:40,350
on public enum there are two<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

148
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,180
Vietnam that's basically being worked on

149
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,140
today just public enum and<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably down</font>

150
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,640
when talk first about public enum

151
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,430
publicly num is assumed to be an opt-in

152
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,979
service and without going through all

153
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the gory detail on a slide here</font>

154
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically this is still very tenuous</font>

155
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,080
effort underway there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

156
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,130
differences of opinion different

157
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,760
governments have different opinions

158
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:09,690
there are privacy issues policy issues

159
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:13,200
and even within from carrier secured

160
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:16,530
corporations and corporations and the

161
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,620
net some of this is that at the very end

162
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,080
point consumer enterprise adoption is a

163
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,470
question mark and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

164
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in the next slide or two but while</font>

165
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,080
enum today is still a industry geek

166
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,819
thing it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to stay that way</font>

167
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,449
because it has to be dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with for VoIP</font>

168
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,450
to succeed

169
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,170
a new concept is private care

170
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,690
infrastructure it out we're finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

171
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:50,390
a lot of corporations are and

172
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:55,520
individuals or basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> non public enum</font>

173
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:57,530
is sprouting up it's a good example

174
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,470
would be an enterprise or Stanton on

175
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,209
carrier corporation has start to

176
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,490
implement voice over IP for all the

177
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,590
internal calling or a good portion of

178
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,450
their internal calling well they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

179
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,850
have some directory to figure out where

180
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,460
do they route these calls and and visit

181
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,210
when their internal calls is an IP

182
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,470
endpoint and again similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the public</font>

183
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,600
there are lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of unanswered questions</font>

184
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:27,500
here with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

185
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,270
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pull model or push model the</font>

186
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,910
thing that we want to leave you here

187
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,740
what is that both private and public are

188
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">logging on to each other they have their</font>

189
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,630
places and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they serve different purposes</font>

190
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:41,180
in fact it's our view that there's

191
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:47,020
probably going to be some hybrid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

192
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:49,040
in the future it's our belief that

193
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:52,699
private enum will be implemented for

194
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">publicly now in fact it's factual that</font>

195
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,100
it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening we know of many</font>

196
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,770
many companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already implemented</font>

197
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,080
variations of private num and publicly

198
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,970
under still being worked through the

199
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,220
different governments both in North

200
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,190
America<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all over the world as well</font>

201
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">as within government regulatory</font>

202
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:17,110
environments enterprises already

203
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,430
creating their private<font color="#CCCCCC"> II</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> noms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

204
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,350
concern here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

205
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,079
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that islands are being created</font>

206
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,780
and once islands are created and how do

207
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,950
you get from one island to another these

208
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,020
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all questions that need to be</font>

209
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:35,330
resolved and worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on by the industry</font>

210
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a whole lastly there is a issue about</font>

211
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:41,840
unlike DNS there the issue about who is

212
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,730
the authoritative de nom who is the

213
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,380
route basically or who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the routes</font>

214
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,380
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has not been answered</font>

215
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:54,140
Security's another issue with a voice

216
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,770
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP there's spit of course which I</font>

217
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:00,410
don't I when I ran this presentation by

218
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,910
our internal legal folks for compliance

219
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,860
and marketing people they were asking

220
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:08,020
like what is spit and say what's

221
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:11,540
basically spam except for voice over IP

222
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:15,079
spam or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet telephony on another</font>

223
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,770
issue that is of concern is about trust

224
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:24,650
between domains where in the peering

225
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:26,480
world we can have domains basically

226
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,270
appearing with each other in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

227
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,770
is a gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this slide network a and</font>

228
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,360
network be may trust each other and

229
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:35,449
never be and<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see may trust each</font>

230
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:40,520
other but a and<font color="#CCCCCC"> C me not trust each</font>

231
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:42,050
other on the next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> here some people</font>

232
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,730
have started implementing session border

233
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,240
controls which is what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SBC stands</font>

234
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:51,550
for so they've des pcs very good as

235
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,870
staffing trust between two domains but

236
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,430
using the previous example you have may

237
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,800
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> SVC simply between network a</font>

238
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,530
network be and between that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

239
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">network see two stabs the trust but</font>

240
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:06,140
because of the way domain peering can

241
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:12,469
work it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't stop the traffic from</font>

242
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:15,770
flowing from<font color="#CCCCCC"> network ad network see so</font>

243
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,510
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of differentiation um one thing</font>

244
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that about VoIP to introduce something</font>

245
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:24,050
new or relatively new depending on your

246
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,800
perspective that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have new</font>

247
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,170
applications that are sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what</font>

248
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,859
I mentioned earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> about latency and</font>

249
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:35,150
basically quality of service issues so

250
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have basically for lack of better</font>

251
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:40,550
term not necessarily quality service

252
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,170
needs but quality needs people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

253
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,199
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do not need quality service</font>

254
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,170
from and at one point to point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

255
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,880
for certain sections to establish a

256
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:54,900
quality session and this is

257
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:59,130
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument up for debate and in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

258
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:01,530
of private peering if for voice or other

259
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,650
spaced applications to be going across

260
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,329
say transit instead of direct

261
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,790
privateering connections what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

262
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,400
going to do to your connection it's

263
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,130
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a unknown variable it could be</font>

264
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,959
fine in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety nine percent in time and</font>

265
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one percent of time it could be</font>

266
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:25,140
horrible or somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in between it's</font>

267
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's all different possibilities lastly</font>

268
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,510
security those two<font color="#E5E5E5"> security issues that</font>

269
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:34,560
dimension um those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just two examples</font>

270
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:37,050
there gazillion security issues that the

271
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,119
voice over IP as well as well sip has

272
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:45,209
not dealt with just real wrapping up on

273
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,370
the future 2004 something that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

274
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:51,000
interesting fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found from the</font>

275
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:54,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">bio nortel that they basically said then</font>

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,980
2004 their shipments of ip-based PBXs

277
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,109
actually see that the traditional TDM

278
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,030
base B deck shipments that's a

279
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,280
fundamental shift in fact when we spoke

280
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,920
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Avaya folks that they were</font>

281
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,069
surprised at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the marketing</font>

282
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,670
sales perspective that the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> PBX is had</font>

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:14,040
actually surpassed TM<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government's</font>

284

are having a civil complex on referring

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that movie about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are</font>

having multiple personalities they're
