1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:07,770
good morning everybody I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:12,360
so many faces too yeah after the long

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:18,330
party yes yesterday so I'm going to talk

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,789
about ipv6 the deployment that we have

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:26,339
done in a very short thing and issues

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:28,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have seen during the rollout</font>

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,430
both from a technical point of view on

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:38,370
the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> code base the hardware and</font>

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:41,870
of course what issues we have seen once

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:48,780
we once we have gone with on a bit

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:51,599
beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> the AAS borderline</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like peering</font>

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,379
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exchanges setting up PA peering</font>

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,010
sessions with other ISPs and stuff like

14
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:03,870
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's start out with a with</font>

15
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:07,619
section 10 a short brief overview about

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,670
the key messages of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day we see that</font>

17
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,140
there's a global movement for ipv6

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,390
several regions of the world are

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,400
demanding that even our customers in

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,430
several regions like the research

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,939
networks that are connected with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us or</font>

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:26,299
the mobile and voice carriers are

23
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,960
demanding that and you've seen it in

24
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:33,530
about a few presentations yesterday when

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:39,149
when there was the urban report that

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:42,810
over the last few years the demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,090
ipv6 allocation is growing and not in a

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,000
linear manner more in an exponential way

29
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,409
so especially in the European and the

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">Asian region yeah i said as i said we</font>

31
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">have customers who are demanding that</font>

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,289
who say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we are just</font>

33
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,509
prolonging<font color="#E5E5E5"> your the contract with you</font>

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,259
when you are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver ipv4</font>

35
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,149
multicast and of course ipv6 for ipv6

36
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,739
they they do not mind whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

37
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,629
tunnel connection or a native one but at

38
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,540
least they want to see some progress

39
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:18,969
from the

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:22,629
your side and the vendors still lack

41
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:25,480
proper support or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all vendors to a</font>

42
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:29,379
proper ipv6 support and things like that

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:35,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we hope to that these things change</font>

44
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:38,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the foreseeable future so the next</font>

45
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our own deployment in a very</font>

46
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,250
brief manner let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin with the</font>

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:49,030
addressing scheme we have received a

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:54,819
location of an / 21 from from ripe this

49
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:57,629
/ 20 21 we divided into several / 32

50
00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:03,879
chunks that we use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> in-country blocks</font>

51
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:08,349
this allows us to support ibgp

52
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:10,108
aggregation or if in the future someone

53
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:13,480
comes up and say hey we need some

54
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:16,450
configuration setup than this addressing

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:21,280
plan would also support<font color="#CCCCCC"> Confederation if</font>

56
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:24,790
it's needed so the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,419
get are getting subdivided into / 40

58
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:35,798
chunks so every every pop from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

59
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:39,849
country get on / 40 and these / 40

60
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:43,060
chunks we say the first / 48<font color="#CCCCCC"> / of that /</font>

61
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:46,418
40 is being used for point-to-point

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:50,019
links for customers like transfer

63
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:54,129
networks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stubble</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and there and</font>

00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:06,429
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> node we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had then we use of</font>

67
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:09,728
course every customer whether it's a

68
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:15,479
it's a hosting customer or an access

69
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:18,099
customer gets and / 48 Adam under say

70
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:22,810
they can document pretty well that they

71
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:25,000
need that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need more so the only</font>

72
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,730
thing with the hosted customers is we

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,110
say

74
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:33,770
the first / 64 out of let out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

75
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:37,550
customer / 48<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use for the hosting</font>

76
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:41,810
setups point point-to-point links for to

77
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:44,390
get to the root of the customer and we r

78
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,600
out of the rest statically to the

79
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:51,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers premises device this has one</font>

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:57,620
big advantage that is the abuse

81
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:59,690
management let's say a customer is just

82
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,110
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transfer network for something</font>

83
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:05,930
else they could do some some shaping

84
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,540
stuff or whatsoever and just rewriting

85
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,450
everything to their point-to-point link

86
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:17,210
address then in the ripe database it's

87
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:19,969
still documented that that the transfer

88
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network belongs to the customer so the</font>

89
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,940
abuse males are directly connected

90
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:29,110
directly send able to the customer

91
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather than to our abuse management desk</font>

92
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:36,170
reasons why we have done this addressing

93
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:46,610
scheme with the / 32 down to / 40 and so

94
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:48,800
on and and why we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using / 64 on</font>

95
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,710
every point<font color="#CCCCCC"> a point link regardless what</font>

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,320
interface type it is whether it's fast e

97
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:58,419
or nvm a or broadcast media or<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointer</font>

98
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">point it's always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enslaves 64 so that's</font>

99
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:06,650
used due to the mostly for management

100
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,280
reasons we want to be able to that the

101
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS reverse resolving is done</font>

102
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,140
automatically we want to do the customer

103
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,770
assignments automatically out of an

104
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">internal dated database and this is just</font>

105
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:24,500
a hassle when you have to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

106
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:28,570
with different sizes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer net</font>

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:32,510
networks so this

108
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:36,849
so far for the addressing stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

109
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:40,610
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> our internal protocol is is is</font>

110
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,830
prior to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rollout phase we thought</font>

111
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,000
okay it would it is a good idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

112
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:50,719
multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> topology is is because of the</font>

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,560
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to have different</font>

114
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">path costs for ipv4 and ipv6 once it's</font>

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,410
deployed and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

116
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:04,670
route around devices in the core that

117
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:09,250
are not yet v6 capable this was a good

118
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:12,580
thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the for the rollout face leave</font>

119
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,830
the starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> face and since we are</font>

120
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,550
completed with rolling out ipv6 in in

121
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:23,060
the entire core it turned out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

122
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:26,810
pretty nice feature still to have a

123
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:32,120
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP metric for 46 and before</font>

124
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:36,020
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick with that we are</font>

125
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,840
only transporting the fruit loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> bags</font>

126
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:43,969
and the backbone interfaces within the

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,940
item within is is you could say as a

128
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,190
side note that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would get away with</font>

129
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,100
having only the loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> X and iOS as that</font>

130
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:55,370
rather than lupex and backbone links

131
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:00,260
because I size doesn't rely on IP to

132
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:03,230
form the adjacencies but we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

133
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:07,099
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ipv6 as we do an IP before</font>

134
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:09,770
with our eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i set up bgp is pretty</font>

135
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward it is the exact same</font>

136
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,440
implementation as in before we have we

137
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,210
support the same local preference

138
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:23,150
structure customers hire local craft

139
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:25,489
than peers and transit we support the

140
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,130
same community set for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers and</font>

141
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:34,940
peer so they can steer<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether get being</font>

142
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:36,830
announced or not yeah with the black

143
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,460
holding community is something that we

144
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,620
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but well gee curing the</font>

145
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:47,350
rollout<font color="#CCCCCC"> face we didn't do it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

146
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it and it will be available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soon</font>

147
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,920
yeah we transport or aggregates and

148
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:01,190
static routes and all the normal stuff

149
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:04,939
we're in ibgp so far so 6p or not this

150
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:08,720
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question prior the rollout do we</font>

151
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,230
do 6p<font color="#E5E5E5"> or or do we rather go for native</font>

152
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,550
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> on every box to do we want to turn</font>

153
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:19,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">on mpls or not the point for for us was</font>

154
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,310
that most of the core and aggregation

155
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,130
devices are juniper based so we said

156
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:30,680
okay with a proper support there so we

157
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:36,260
rather go for native ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> then 6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feet</font>

158
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:39,949
because 6p is as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> seed and I'm not so</font>

159
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:44,960
nice so solution because there's an

160
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:47,840
mapped ipv4 to ipv6 next up for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,230
sessions and well it's nice for foreign

162
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,230
rollout thing but unless there is a

163
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:58,070
proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp and RSVP support for mpls</font>

164
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:02,330
traffic engineering 6p is nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

165
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:05,270
nice so we said we would ya rather go

166
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:08,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the real thing let's so far from the</font>

167
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:11,960
technology side of 6pe there's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

168
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,360
commercial and economic result in the

169
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,140
future we may be forced to use equipment

170
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,470
in the core in the middle of the core

171
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:25,370
especially with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 10g stuff that</font>

172
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:29,660
forces us to use equipment that is not

173
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,820
yet v6 capable just because it's so much

174
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:36,140
cheaper than than any other gear that

175
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:39,800
that we have so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far so I am so the</font>

176
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,930
economics maybe at driver for 6p in the

177
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:47,060
future so let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what really happens</font>

178
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:49,910
then hardware that we are using is we

179
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,319
have rolled out ipv6 until every core

180
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:57,430
device which is an M

181
00:10:51,320 --> 00:11:00,320
serious juniper thing and to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> juniper</font>

182
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,290
aggregation boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco's we didn't</font>

183
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,020
touch yet but I come to that point a

184
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:09,079
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later in detail and to</font>

185
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Juniper e-series we didn't roll it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

186
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet because yeah I come to the point</font>

187
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,510
later in detail as well so we've covered

188
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,850
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-five percent with a used</font>

189
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:25,569
hardware so far and it works quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

190
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:30,470
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far good next thing is the vendors</font>

191
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:33,460
them yeah some vendors really

192
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:38,440
successfully prevent a proper rollout of

193
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:42,050
v6 let's come to the two famous ones

194
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:46,640
juniper easier is is there there's only

195
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:50,180
ospfv3 support since the last version i

196
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:54,710
have seen but no eyes i have support yet

197
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:57,349
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just operational annoying but</font>

198
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,210
not not a real problem you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you</font>

199
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,550
could come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with something that it</font>

200
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,220
works together<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the rest of the</font>

201
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,780
hardware but they're much more annoying

202
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,930
factors that juniper is charging a

203
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,120
premium amount of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for the v6</font>

204
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:15,800
license and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous just</font>

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:19,130
because you know v6 is not something

206
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,560
that's grants and carrier to have a

207
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,930
license for printing money it's just an

208
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,150
it's just an add-on service for<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

209
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,459
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's it's nothing premium so</font>

210
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,680
we do not understand what juniper is

211
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,800
doing that and especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the easier</font>

212
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,680
is this is annoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> because so many</font>

213
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,400
carriers are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the e-series boxes as</font>

214
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,489
their dsl terminating staff for the

215
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">residential market so there could be</font>

216
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,030
more dsl users having v6 right now if

217
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,550
they wouldn't do that kind of stuff and

218
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:55,730
endures as a side note it is interesting

219
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:58,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've seen in the reason in the</font>

220
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:02,600
newest process from geneva that they

221
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:04,360
start charging an unlicensed fee for the

222
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">m series and t series as</font>

223
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,310
well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know whether it's a good</font>

224
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:13,870
political thing or not but it's up to

225
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,339
Juniper to desired cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the next one</font>

226
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,500
it's it's a really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

227
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,240
because this from an operational point

228
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,240
of view no common code base for

229
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,329
different platforms that really work or

230
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,899
work together for example for the GSR

231
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:32,079
you there's a 1200 s code which is

232
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:36,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">working quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok depends on what line</font>

233
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:39,430
card type you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on earth but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 OS is</font>

234
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:43,060
it's not having v6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-table to</font>

235
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:46,989
apologize I fought<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the 75 hours of</font>

236
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:50,199
72 models so for these models you need

237
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:53,529
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 12 22 as if you want to multi</font>

238
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:57,700
to apologize and v6 and all the features

239
00:13:53,529 --> 00:14:01,390
that are interesting from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one carrier</font>

240
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,430
point of view so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just from</font>

241
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,439
operational side annoying but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

242
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,180
be nice to have a common base because

243
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,430
you would assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the</font>

244
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:15,040
common base of box as well or no

245
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:18,519
challenges sorry but still the 12 to ask

246
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:24,370
train has severe box with within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

247
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:27,880
safe code we have switched on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the checks</font>

248
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">f stuff and we have seen that while the</font>

249
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:36,550
v6 stuff doesn't have miss mismatches

250
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:40,480
the before stuff has many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEF</font>

251
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:44,109
mismatches so safe doesn't really work

252
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,899
properly with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 to as code and the</font>

253
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:51,190
latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> code I've seen was 12 to 25 s4 or</font>

254
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:53,860
so so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard to choose an an</font>

255
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,870
iOS code for the 75 model citizen that

256
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:00,610
is really working well for IP before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

257
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:04,060
die PVC so I'm sorry this this

258
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,279
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an issue in these days and</font>

259
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,040
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more self is around for quite a</font>

260
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:13,420
while but you know and lesson there's an

261
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:16,689
interesting in famous ghost route but

262
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,099
which has been accepted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by Cisco last</font>

263
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,550
year when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

264
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,630
with Clara crossing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is this</font>

265
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:28,060
block and it was for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time</font>

266
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:32,529
reproducible but up to now there's no

267
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:35,979
fix here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yet so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's for the two</font>

268
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:39,310
famous vendors I picked some some others

269
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,500
randomly so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no personal or</font>

270
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,018
company preference thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

271
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:49,180
random where I know some people alcatel

272
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:52,440
and talipes the key message there is

273
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,449
that both do not have an ipv6 deck yet

274
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,790
both do not have multi to apologize is

275
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:03,060
yet and the timelines for both are

276
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:06,579
slightly differing while talipes

277
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:09,989
promised to have out something end of

278
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:15,069
this year maybe quarter one next year

279
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:20,410
alcatel is still far off to have

280
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:23,079
something in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the v6 and I multi topology</font>

281
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">work so the key message he is again we</font>

282
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,410
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> into 2005 and ipv6 is around for</font>

283
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:31,660
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years now so you would assume</font>

284
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any vendor that wants to sell new</font>

285
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:42,610
gear to today supports v6 properly but

286
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:45,639
in fact they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't so so far for the our</font>

287
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:49,449
rollout experience with it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

288
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:55,240
hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with a software stuff now</font>

289
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:58,479
let's go when we go beyond our our own

290
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">AAS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> border so once we we were starting</font>

straightforward that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 unicast and</font>

00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:22,379
they are all using production ipv6 space

297
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:25,360
that is especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if reserved for</font>

internet exchange points so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we assume</font>

299
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,260
that would be the same in in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

300
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:31,260
here but we have been proven<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font>

301
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:40,490
yeah some some of the exchanges he still

302
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:44,340
use experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> space or still using a</font>

303
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,560
separate VLAN for ipv4 and ipv6 and I've

304
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,399
approached them and say listen why do

305
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you why do you divide these two</font>

306
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,500
protocols they do not harm and and it

307
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,470
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been proven around the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

308
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,350
you could have both on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

309
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:05,070
same vida but still they they they

310
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,409
didn't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it and the result</font>

311
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,210
of that is that and carrier is forced to

312
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,490
have the investment for an extra

313
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,250
interface and we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

314
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,630
budgets for everything a pretty low and

315
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,850
you have to go you<font color="#CCCCCC"> too you're</font>

316
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,190
controlling Department Tuesday look I

317
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,620
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interface for this and that and</font>

318
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,200
if you just come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with I want to peer</font>

319
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,939
ipv6 this therefore I need to buy on

320
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,430
Giggy and interface for about eleven

321
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:34,700
thousand dollars you're controlling

322
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,700
departments will probably say no thanks

323
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:42,380
other things we have seen is the use of

324
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:50,280
non production<font color="#E5E5E5"> space again I've</font>

325
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,409
approached the IXPs providers and listen

326
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:56,850
why don't you go for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> production</font>

327
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:59,220
space there<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't reserved space and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm</font>

328
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,879
but they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well three FF II space is</font>

329
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">still working why should I well the</font>

330
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,760
reasons are on hands and this there

331
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,720
might be problems with Gina's reverse

332
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:16,560
resolving and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course 30 free space is</font>

333
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:22,560
planned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go away next year's on the</font>

334
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:24,960
sixth of June 666 and yeah and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

335
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:31,230
time frame they need to renumber anyway

336
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,870
so why don't do it now I'm no time mmm

337
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,820
the

338
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,459
third thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have seen is that</font>

339
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:41,000
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially on the west coast there</font>

340
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:43,550
are exchanges that haven't more or<font color="#CCCCCC"> less</font>

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,400
shared layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interest in frustration</font>

342
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:49,550
and more or less shared IP before

343
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,480
appearing land structure but for ipv6

344
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:55,159
they don't and I've asked them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to why</font>

345
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,830
they do not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that under sail you</font>

346
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,890
well we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to it's more or less</font>

347
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:03,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">political reasons and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that this</font>

348
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:07,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is being solved soon but up to now</font>

349
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:10,040
this prevents that carrier that the

350
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,809
commercial carriers are having peering

351
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:18,110
relationship in ipv6 with the research

352
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:21,320
networks mostly but I had a discussion

353
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:23,809
yes yesterday and the there's some light

354
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,360
at the end of the tunnel PP people are

355
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:32,389
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that and I hope that</font>

356
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:34,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to be the the case soon so so</font>

357
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">far for the exchanges we have problem we</font>

358
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> observed other technical problems</font>

359
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:44,479
during our rollout and one of them were

360
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:49,010
misconfigured tunnels like this is

361
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,000
especially the case when people just<font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font>

362
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">up GRE tunnels and do not care about the</font>

363
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,220
payload MTO and there are performance

364
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:03,800
issues like you do not get the proper

365
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:07,160
throughput<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the tunnel because of</font>

366
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:11,290
the wrong and MTU settings when the

367
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:15,050
tunnel endpoints are you are using the

368
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:19,250
automatic derived MTU from the egrets in

369
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:25,790
the interface let's say oh I've got an

370
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:29,360
example here stolen from Cisco when two

371
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:33,409
routers are terminating a tunnel then

372
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,540
and and and both of them are using as an

373
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:39,910
egress interface something like III t3

374
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:44,010
or pause then the paler the MTU would be

375
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">4470 and then respective for</font>

376
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:51,390
respectively for the tunnels a few bars

377
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:53,940
less but this would assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

378
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,820
entire path would rely on on high

379
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,340
bandwidth links with high<font color="#E5E5E5"> end to use so</font>

380
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:04,770
if if there's one hop in the middle of

381
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the two endpoints with just an empty or</font>

382
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">1,500 then you face real problems with</font>

383
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,870
the throughput<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tunnel there's</font>

384
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:15,510
fragmenting done and often there's just

385
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,739
ping traffic going<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over over the</font>

386
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:25,740
link rather than production traffic so

387
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:30,440
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommend that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once people are</font>

388
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:34,680
setting up tunnels that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

389
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:37,080
fixed ton payload MTU settings and this

390
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,350
is done on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the both on juniper and cisco</font>

391
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:46,740
on the interface level with ipv6 MTU or

IP VIP with IP sick inet6 empty empty

393

GRE tunnels or ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> in if ipv6 in v4 and</font>

395
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,950
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a best practice thing to</font>

396
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:05,420
just verify that the tunnels<font color="#E5E5E5"> are set</font>

397
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:08,160
setting up correctly with the right

398
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:14,100
values by pinging all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel</font>

400
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:21,270
we have seen as i call it cat careless

401
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,149
bgp that is some of the PS that we have

402
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:27,600
seen do not care to have a local

403
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,880
preference structure like in before they

404
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,100
attack all right or they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even</font>

405
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the route as customer appear or</font>

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:38,580
whatsoever out they seem to have for

407
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,880
every route they receive a local

408
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:45,449
preference of 100 which will result

409
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:49,830
often in a non connectivity as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show</font>

410
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">you here the next slide assuming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

411
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,980
there's an customer c1 having<font color="#CCCCCC"> on v6</font>

412
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:57,600
prefix and we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer</font>

413
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,049
is getting transit from t1

414
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,409
t2 t1 and t2 appearing with each other

415
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:09,049
and we assume that t1 are getting is

416
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:13,470
getting upstream from T 3 and T 2 with

417
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:17,370
tt4 we for now assume that the customer

418
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:19,169
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepare 32 so that that means</font>

419
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the propagation would be like this</font>

420
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:26,130
the customer sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trust t1 and t2</font>

421
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,179
both are reared vertising their customer

422
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:33,570
out to t3 and t4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pee with each</font>

423
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:36,480
other so they have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup path so in</font>

424
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:39,000
that case everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is working fine but</font>

425
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,740
once the customer starts to prepend two

426
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,400
or three times<font color="#CCCCCC"> tall what towards gt2</font>

427
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:50,730
then the things a little bit changing

428
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:56,520
then the propagation looks like this c1

429
00:24:50,730 --> 00:25:01,620
is announcing its routes to t1 non

430
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:05,340
prepended t2 is seeing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes from</font>

431
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,689
z1 over the direct link prepended but

432
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:12,720
since they do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> local</font>

433
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:15,720
preference they use the route<font color="#CCCCCC"> from t1</font>

436
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:27,809
greet advertise the customer out to t4

437
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:32,129
because they do not send peering routes

438
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:34,830
to their upstream but t1 is sending the

439
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,669
customer link and the customer odd up to

440
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,908
t3<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a connectivity but</font>

441
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:46,049
assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between t1 and t3</font>

442
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:49,309
is failing the color<font color="#E5E5E5"> then t3 and t4 do</font>

443
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:54,510
not see the route from<font color="#E5E5E5"> see one anywhere</font>

444
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:59,270
else and the customer see one does have

445
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:59,270
the wrong assumption that he has a

446
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:06,870
second upstream in case something goes

447
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:09,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong so the behavior of TT through is</font>

448
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,969
t2 is actually

449
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:16,270
more harmful that it is worth for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

450
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:21,910
customer it is clear so far I would say

451
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:25,060
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay another thing we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen is</font>

452
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:29,410
the misconfigured<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogan filters or anti</font>

453
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:33,879
ball one filters people are we have seen

454
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:36,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people are we're filtering our</font>

455
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">allocation in the first days and it took</font>

456
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,180
us the best of three months to get all

457
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,540
that sorted going to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPCA listen we</font>

458
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:45,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">are please fix your filters and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

459
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> ugly to get these things sorted</font>

460
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:53,590
some of the carrots were answering fast

461
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:57,580
some of them were not and yeah it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

462
00:26:53,590 --> 00:27:01,870
real hassle so else we have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

463
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:05,020
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> defective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PPI space reserved</font>

464
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:07,750
for root name servers or for internet

465
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,090
exchanges or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet projects which</font>

466
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,540
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still filtering too strict</font>

467
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:18,220
and don't use the more specifics so our

468
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:21,940
assumption is don't filter too tight

469
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,860
what you accept from your peers but we

470
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,240
type what you would you accept from your

471
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:31,149
customers so acting liberally here is

472
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually less harmful than acting strict</font>

473
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:41,890
so we recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to have a more</font>

474
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:47,220
relaxed set of filters applied so so far

475
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:50,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">for free free transit what was is an ism</font>

476
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:53,080
coin with two sides free transit is a

477
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:55,360
good good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing where we have seen</font>

478
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,570
people giving free transit to other

479
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">people's to other people when when they</font>

480
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">help them getting boot straps getting</font>

481
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">started with v6 there are some projects</font>

482
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,460
in Europe and and you ask all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

483
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:12,160
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing there's</font>

484
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,890
another good thing for free transit for

485
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,170
strict backup links so people when

486
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,210
people make make sure that on free

487
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:22,260
transit of an internet exchange or

488
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:27,810
wherever or<font color="#E5E5E5"> even even tunneled is</font>

489
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">hmm being set with pre pans and a very</font>

490
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:33,060
low local preference that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a</font>

491
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:37,650
good thing but what is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

492
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:39,629
is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are giving free transit</font>

493
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:42,600
away to other eyes peas that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

494
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:47,820
already native alternate<font color="#CCCCCC"> vb6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from their</font>

495
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,030

496
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:55,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">weight for their own peering</font>

497
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:57,300
relationship just discussion and stuff

498
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,910
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we consider that really bad</font>

499
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,940
and and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have actually seen peers of</font>

500
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:06,930
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that announce us about 80 70 80 90</font>

501
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:09,420
100 v6 routes from customers and when

502
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:12,720
and once if we looked into it then we

503
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,520
have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 10 or 20 of</font>

504
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,220
these routes where from<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual paying</font>

505
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,879
before cus customer so the ratio is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

506
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:27,660
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so the ratio is a little</font>

507
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:30,060
bit strange then we have seen some misc

508
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:34,590
annulus just of operational annoying

509
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:37,830
problems which was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS ip's ip6</font>

510
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:40,919
dollar per<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 ip6 ind the other way</font>

511
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,960
around and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that there is</font>

512
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,790
technology why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a real problem</font>

513
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,470
but just from an operational point

514
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,180
annoying when you do trade routes and

515
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:54,120
you do not have a proper reverse

516
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:56,880
resolving so this far from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our things</font>

517
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have seen once we go be beyond</font>

518
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,090
the a s borders we have found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

519
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say on a conclusion of course</font>

520
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:10,679
the vendors need to get their stuff

521
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:13,200
sorted and and should have proper ipv6

522
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,840
support in in their software and of

523
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,920
course the hardware as well soon proper

524
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,689
means non different code bases for the

cannot choose whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and then</font>

527
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:35,549
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the I XP should get their self</font>

528
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:37,289
sorted non going from non<font color="#CCCCCC"> product</font>

529
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:40,309
despues to production space and having

530
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:43,200
v6 and before undersea same villain and

531
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:47,519
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the tunnels people should</font>

532
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,590
avoid transcontinental tunnels and start

533
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,809
like that for the peering of

534
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:55,080
relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found it is a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:57,379
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that have a proper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Locker</font>

prefers structure that supports

537
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:04,469
communities and all these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

538
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">are used to have in the IP before word</font>

539
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:13,019
and yeah even if an ISP is peering with

540
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:15,748
another carrier who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is having a full</font>

541
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:19,919
route swap with someone else it would be

542
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:22,080
nice that when the when that certain ISP

543
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,720
would offer communities that other

544
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,009
people can steer whether they want to be

545
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,109
announced so that full route<font color="#E5E5E5"> swap or not</font>

546
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:34,619
so and the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing I wanted to</font>

547
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is pointers there's since in a</font>

548
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:41,668
few weeks now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very good ipv6 of</font>

549
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,029
operational mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists where most of</font>

551
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:50,369
are subscribed already but in case you

552
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:54,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't know this is a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good list and</font>

553
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:57,209
a good thing to have operational meta

554
00:31:54,059 --> 00:32:00,210
discussions this there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two projects</font>

555
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:02,429
both in Europe and the states are going

556
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,929
on in the state it's the arcade project

557
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:08,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they are helping people to get</font>

558
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:10,320
bootstrap with v6 until the ISPs get

559
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:12,809
their stuff sorted and have native or

560
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">tunneled ipv6 transit from their current</font>

561
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:22,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipv before providers and in Europe it's</font>

562
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:26,749
the 60 X 6 X s probe project thank you

563
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:26,749
and yeah do you have any questions

564
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,130
silence<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

565
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:42,440
we've got time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe two questions</font>

566
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:45,000
yes please nigga<font color="#CCCCCC"> Georgia telecom yo</font>

567
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,120
Rick<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what you were telling</font>

568
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,040
about the filtering got me a little bit

569
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:56,580
surprised what's happening what you are

570
00:32:53,040 --> 00:33:01,980
telling about the filtering yes um if

571
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:06,540
you are doing strict filtering for your

572
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:10,290
customers why would I as you appear need

573
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:12,600
to be liberal about what you what I

574
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,909

registered in some database and you're

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:24,179
only your own rules are registered there

578
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,580
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me precisely what term</font>

579
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,890
i have to look up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database to get</font>

583
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:43,169
v6 well that many peers of us do not

584
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:49,830
filter their customers anyway well well

585
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so in v6 yes well in the v6 world</font>

when you look at look at it from the

v-force point a point of view and

589
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:09,000
experience this in it and it's somewhat

590
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:13,199
strange that well okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> you people do not</font>

mv6 for yourself so there's no real tool

605
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:11,070
support now the tool support is is

606
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:13,980
pretty young into in comparison to how

607
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,640
long people are using v6 yet so you have

608
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:20,160
to give the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people a little bit time to</font>
