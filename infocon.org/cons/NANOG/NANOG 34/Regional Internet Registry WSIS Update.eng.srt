00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:33,349
registry directly to end users<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

145
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,299
are aware currently end users can only

146
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:37,819
go directly to the registry and get

147
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:39,859
provider independent ipv4 space they

148
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:45,379
cannot get provider independent ipv6

149
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:47,419
base and the urn meeting in the meeting

150
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:52,249
room when a consensus measure was taken

151
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:55,339
by the chair of the meeting the room was

152
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:58,399
basically evenly divided and so this

153
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:00,169
discussion is currently ongoing and so

154
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">all three of these things can definitely</font>

155
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,068
affect the way you do business of the

156
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,899
future so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not participating in</font>

157
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:09,589
these discussions you should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

158
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:12,379
so you can expect these same discussions

159
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:14,959
to occur in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other regions as time</font>

160
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:19,429
moves forward and moves<font color="#E5E5E5"> into their next</font>

161
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:30,319

that were discussed two were deferred

one the directory services overhauls

privacy discussions and the other one

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,960
was deferred was the one I referred to

<font color="#E5E5E5">in regards to the ipv6 assignments for</font>

and we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into last call and none</font>

198
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,970
were deemed to be abandoned there was

199
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,930
one policy decision that was taken by

200
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,970
the Aaron Board of Trustees which was to

201
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:38,250
suspend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> portion of the Aaron</font>

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,300
policies that pertained only to

was suspended there is currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

207
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:58,449
policy proposal now to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> this portion</font>

208
00:10:53,529 --> 00:11:01,449
of the policy to an historical status so

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">having said that and I'm going to do a</font>

Susan likes to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at the end so but</font>

212
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,459
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it is is that I</font>

215
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,209
well one of the places you can do it is

216
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,670
at an errand public policy meeting

217
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously the best place to do it is on</font>

218
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:25,059
the public policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list but you</font>

well I could really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a difference of</font>

236
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,740
your ability even to sit in this room

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the discussions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

238
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,769
having over the next several days so

239
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:23,230
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a UN created activity</font>

240
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:27,069
and it's primarily created and being run

241
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:29,379
by governments to discuss and define the

242

actions for governments of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

243
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:37,259
and it exists because there is concern

244
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,759
in several quarters throughout the globe

245
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:43,569
about the ad hoc nature of the

governance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and expected</font>

247
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:48,910
outcomes so far two of them already been

248
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,860
done and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're done at the first summit</font>

of 2003 in Geneva which is a statement

251
00:12:53,799 --> 00:13:00,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">of principles and a plan of action and</font>

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,439
tation of that plan and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected</font>

254

where all those things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

discuss the way nanog is going to be

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a governing board but you do</font>

have a program committee that is active

minutes and meetings are published you

351
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,610
do have proceedings that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are published</font>

do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some people want to change it what's</font>

357

wrong with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current model well some</font>

358
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,490
people say it's insufficiently

360
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,610
doesn't adequately permit international

362
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:35,129
that is too capitalistic is to private

the person that's using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word but</font>

368
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:55,020
bottom line is what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really about</font>

369
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:56,930
is power what are the risks well you can

end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a UN based governance body</font>

policy process being dismantled or made

375
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,180
it irrelevant and you can see everything

376
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,090
becoming responsive to politicians not

377
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,530

379
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:25,860
if you become irrelevant you won't come

<font color="#CCCCCC">to a meeting like this so in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your future</font>

381
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,820
what about the ITU well some people

00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,740
claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the witness is the attempt by</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet well that's not really the case</font>

385
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:41,070

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,960
there are large number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

advocating changed from the existing

389
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,290
either they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at some other</font>

390
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:52,230
form of governance model to exist so

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not just the ITU so you can't sit</font>

there and wave the boogeyman that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

to use the bad guidance thing certainly

they are an active player<font color="#CCCCCC"> and certainly</font>

395
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,970
they've got things that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

396
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,520
for example in the address space

397
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,490
management area there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal that</font>

399
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,380
and restructured that says that there

400
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,510
should be some sort of national

401
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,430
allocation of IP address space the same

402
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,830
way there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone numbering plan</font>

403
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:24,630
so that every country would have its

00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:27,389
fair share allocation of ipv6 addresses

405
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,650
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly fairness could be is an</font>

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,240

407
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,320
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and then</font>

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,390
and pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and that's why your</font>

active participation and apology process

410
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:45,530
is most most important

411
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:47,570
but is the allocation and a bunch of

412
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,040
countries probably the bigger country is

413
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,720
getting together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the pie is going to be divided up and</font>

416
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,080
is that the answer for some people that

00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">say yes it is and a lot more people to</font>
