00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,580
blue my name is Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> m'lady again I</font>

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,000
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDs this is my second time</font>

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,490
doing this panel and I hope that you all

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,620
enjoy this panel because many of the

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,809
operators from last payroll definitely

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,550
expressed interest that we had such few

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,349
spaces that there's lots of

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,210
opportunities for more operators to keep

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,070
doing more panels so I hope it's

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,170
interesting for you as it is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">us and that we can keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going with this</font>

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:33,840
as a regular program item going forward

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,230
so hello just give you an overview when

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,290
I when I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,839
panel I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of who</font>

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,850
you are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you are and what your</font>

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,489
pricing might be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to be</font>

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,430
what is new<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what challenges do you</font>

19
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,410
see and what are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing going forward</font>

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:55,739
and that went really really well last

21
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,769
time and so I kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same principle</font>

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,718
with the folks that you see up here so

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,550
then we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> speakers i reduced a</font>

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,170
number of speakers on this panel after

25
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,939
feedback from last panel that there

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,979
wasn't enough time for questions for the

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,779
speakers so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will hold your</font>

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,158
questions till the end we will get to

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,740
them at the end so i have my cues from

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,979
the links Dave Meyer from Oregon IX Tom

33
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,520
wave that is quite the variety of

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,930
different types of exchanges be it

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,740
commercial membership-based or

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:37,950
educational research so with that I will

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:40,048
introduce my<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks Chris um I</font>

38
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,880

41
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,700
a lot of time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and it's great</font>

42
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,408
that somebody can actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so r</font>

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,310
& applause for Chris put in the effort

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,960
in there

45
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,130
I think more than anything getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,729
together because it's like herding cats

47
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,048
um I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go talk about our gradient</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">atanga can be on the real world</font>

comment there that actually a 40 gigs to

53
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:15,180
me is anyway not really a lot of use um

54
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,620
quick slide about where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are right now</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Antarctica and nostril Asian actually no</font>

60
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:32,560
well so we've got everywhere except

61

Antarctica present at six<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry hotels</font>

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,080
situation where the exchange in Europe

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,549
is actually usually not owned by the by

the karyotypes a separate switch

66

67
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,170
facilities those are felt with by

companies whose primary purposes power

69
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,208
and cooling and security and most kind

70
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,000
of things so dual platform multiple 10

that we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people um so 10 gig</font>

80
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:21,760
we've been running it for quite a while

81
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:25,030
now um 2001 foundry went and made 10 gig

82

modules for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their I'm call the guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nate</font>

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite a while we've run that in our</font>

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,970
backbone and it worked we just plugged

86
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,370
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and it came up and it wasn't</font>

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,620
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything to be scared of we've</font>

88
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,170
recently completed overhaul of this we

89
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,090
deployed foundries MGA we did this

90
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,010
because we obviously needed to offer our

91
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,079
10 gig ports towards the members and

92
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">also we could quite happily fill up a</font>

93
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:52,030
foundry 15,000 with Giggy ports from our

94
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,739
members so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed more ports in a</font>

95
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,470
single box because of the busiest site

96
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,460
is you know almost 80 gig ports and

97
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,070
that's

98
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,360
I than growing it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big problem</font>

99
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,850
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we had some issues with the line</font>

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,260
cards crashing but we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> rain most</font>

101
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those issues now they've been patched</font>

102
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,620
and we're now connecting a buffers 10 k

103
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,880
participants and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

104
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,990
we're seeing as well as 10 gig is

105
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,450
obviously a growth in<font color="#E5E5E5"> link out</font>

106
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,250
connections but we found bugs in member

107
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">Reuters if you've got a cisco with a</font>

109
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:25,300
these food beef food floods and these

110
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,540
seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot more prevalent in a</font>

111
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,720
trunk connection and there's also some I

112
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,070
cpu load conditions<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but of course</font>

113
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to do everything twice</font>

114
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,550
because we have two vlans and we really

115
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,950
love pain and maintenance work and

116
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,540
sorrow so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

117
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:45,310
again so we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this</font>

118
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,310
again it does mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

119
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,720
twice and we can we can go and use the

120
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,060
experience from the first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> around as</font>

121
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,730
a cushion for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second time round and</font>

122
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,900
and use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience to help us try</font>

123
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,240
and do things a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better this</font>

124
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,560
time we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade the extreme</font>

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,660
platform to be of an equivalent

126
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,940
specification because both networks need

127
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:08,260
to be roughly equal their load sharing

128
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,910
redundant networks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

129
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,260
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm currently in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">selection process so I'm slightly</font>

131
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,370
limited what I can say I obviously don't

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,360
really want to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upset the guys</font>

133
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,850
that were dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with at the moment</font>

134
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would negotiating with but if</font>

135
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,530
anybody does want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to me</font>

136
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,050
privately about that Phil free quick

137
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,299
selection data point I went and<font color="#E5E5E5"> got our</font>

138
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,310
packet data and the majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

139
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,030
packets about sixty percent are all

140
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,710
small less than 128 bytes then about

141
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,289
another thirty percent is big stuff and

142
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,080
the remaining ten fifteen percent is the

143
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,430
stuff in the middle and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

144
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,680
we've actually got to be in a position

145
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,060
where we can have consistent performance

146
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,750
across the box from small to large

147
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,010
packet sizes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a major</font>

148
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,810
selection criteria when we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

149
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,969
kit we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this consistent</font>

150
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,790
predictable performance particularly

151
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,770
with stuff like VoIP and interactive

152
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,450
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> my video conferencing and they've</font>

153
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,609
always got guys are doing gaming as well

154
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,960
um what shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen when you're</font>

155
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,400
upgrading things is sleeping on the

156
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,568
packaging from your equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

157
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,349
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my engine is getting</font>

158
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:13,800
ready to bed down for the evening what's

159
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:16,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed this evening this time actually</font>

160
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,069
there's no Big Bang so when we did the

161
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,309
foundry stuff we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went out and we ordered</font>

162
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,300
a load of kit in one go what we're going

163
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:23,830
to do this time is we're going to

164
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,659
trickle the hardware in slowly we're

165
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,099
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a box do a bunch of</font>

166
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:30,969
acceptance testing and acceptance

167
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:32,498
criteria get it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

168
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:34,179
really outweighs the disadvantages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

169
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:36,999
the homogeneous network because we can

170
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:38,979
just go a go at a steady pace um the

171
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:40,149
other thing test as much as possible and

172
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,279
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you think you've tested it's</font>

173
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:45,180
all you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> test it again I don't think</font>

174
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can be too thorough within reason</font>

175
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,959
part of the reason that we that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

176
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:52,240
issues with the mg<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 was that we haven't</font>

177
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,709
been able to do enough testing in our

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,969
opinion now in hindsight<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great</font>

179
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:59,409
thing of the 40 port<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1gig line card and</font>

180
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:00,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">also we have agreed acceptance criteria</font>

181
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,279
with the vendor especially for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

182
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:04,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">first system an acceptance criteria for</font>

183
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,089
when we actually go and give them some

184
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,589
money and order some more step off them

185
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:10,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously if it doesn't meet</font>

186
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:13,990
the criteria we get them to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font>

187
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:16,300
take it away so that's basically the 10

188
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,669
gig thing where are we going really well

189
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:23,709
it's n by 10 gig now we're already doing

190
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,119
trunking as i said earlier 40 gig isn't

191
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,729
much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it of much interest to us</font>

192
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:29,680
because I this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a metro network in</font>

moment currently working on some other

203

projects with looking at multicast

215
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,570

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,560
make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing scale so that's</font>

217
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,030
going to be thanks something that's

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,800
discussed at the links meeting in London

219
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,330
next week one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the approaches I took</font>

220
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,279
was to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask other people what they</font>

221
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,169
were doing about doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs and tax</font>

222
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,210
place clattering a lot of it was just

223
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,130
manual I just go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a big list and</font>

224
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,110
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and will account a VLAN that works</font>

225
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,029
for everybody I went spoke to the guys

226
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,740
over that may services they have six

227
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,710
full-time programmers writing tools so

228
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,680
they don't have tagging<font color="#CCCCCC"> vci clashes and</font>

229
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:53,050
that kind of thing and the other thing

230
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,579
is collecting s flow data for traffic

231
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,020
management purposes anybody whose neck

232
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">linux customers familiar with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

233
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,490
of thing already and we're currently

234
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:02,320
working in that area<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now as we've</font>

235
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,970
got that availability not available in

236
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,540
our foundry switches and also come along

237
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,760
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extreme platform and from me</font>

238
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,930
that's it anybody don't take questions

239
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,089
now more would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a death</font>

240
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,089
questions after<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks</font>

241
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah Dave Meyer from Oregon</font>

242
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:47,140
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is gonna be a little bit</font>

243
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:48,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">different um many of you may be been to</font>

oregon before or till<font color="#E5E5E5"> eugene before</font>

245
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,640
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the organ in exchanges so</font>

246
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a little bit</font>

247
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,420
about where we're at um that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

248
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,219
worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so genda looks like brief</font>

249
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,990
history current status features and if

250
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,300
anybody would have really want this talk

251
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,650
is right there so here's the first

252
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is you know when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i talk to</font>

253
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,470
people about this is you know many

254
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,590
people here maybe know where organ is

255
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,910
but it's kind of the rectangular there's

256
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,800
kind of a state between we're in

257
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,360
Washington right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now there's a there's a</font>

258
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,979
big State Southwest called California

259
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a kind of a rectangular one in</font>

260
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,490
the middle that's where origin is um in

261
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:26,260
case you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering um but if you take</font>

262
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">a slightly closer look you'll see that</font>

263
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oregon internet exchanges in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Eugene</font>

264
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,990
which is kind of right in the middle of

265
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">this state on the west side of the</font>

266
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:38,320
Cascades and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a small</font>

267
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">smallish kind of town but 120k people</font>

268
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
but it's not a large metro area which

269
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,489
presents all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems for</font>

270
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,750
trying to build an exchange there um so

271
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,770
here's the brief history of how we got

272
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,180
here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there basically um I was over</font>

273
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,560
across the street from the UFO in the

274
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,810
northwest christian college and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

275
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,030
noticed Randy's reign net pop was like

276
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,439
under somebody's desk and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

277
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,140
there's a bunch of modems and wires and

278
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,790
stuff and I said hey Randy why you bring

279
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,230
this over to the UFO and we can peer and

280
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,880
you know maybe get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

281
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,470
and that's how this all started this

282
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,970
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very cooperative regional</font>

283
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:15,760
effort and so is reign net you go in our

284
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,400
what at the time was our experimental

285
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,310
state of Oregon network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> now morphed</font>

286
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,819

were in production<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and well we</font>

288
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,000
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred megabytes which or</font>

attending<font color="#E5E5E5"> that switch because we weren't</font>

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,490
exchanging a lot of traffic and we had

291
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,560
quest fiber but it wasn't fiber that was

292
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,460
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for anybody to use it was</font>

293
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,650
just what they were bringing their

294
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,580
services in on so we had a you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

295
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,380
very small start oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we had some</font>

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,050
of hooked Randy on I said hey you know

298
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,610
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got all this great space there with</font>

299
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,560
you well it turned out that we just

300
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,810
hijacked some space and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I closet across</font>

the street from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> U</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> O and that's</font>

302
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,869
how it all started well we have nowadays

303
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,029
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 30 peers and they're</font>

mostly regional the downturn had

305
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,810
substantial impact on on the amount of

306
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,610

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:10,640
able to that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have are switching</font>

309
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,470
environments a lot less commercial than

310
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,960
what we just heard is just duel hb20

311
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">800s we we have ten hundred thousand</font>

313
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,850

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,420
ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 and multicast fabric there so</font>

315
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,760
you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want on it and</font>

316
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,680
nowadays we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have several regional local</font>

317
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,120
and long haul fiber providers so it

318
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,510
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a little bit easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

319
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,370

323
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,870
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of the situation there</font>

00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,190
nowadays the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of services we try to</font>

328
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,240
this kind of consulting because a lot of

329
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,490
the people who want to connect here are

330
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,080
small regional school districts things

331
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,310
like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they all they</font>

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,850
frequently need help with routing

339
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,290
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about where we're going well</font>

340
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:25,380
we're building additional fiber

341

<font color="#E5E5E5">for those people can get there from here</font>

344
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,450
we're thinking we want to upgrade to 10g

345
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,930
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have much</font>

346
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:39,210
traffic to justify it and then in the

347
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,949
services thing we have some experimental

348
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,610
VoIP pairing things we're doing with

349
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,410
local<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and some e cash kind of</font>

350
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,530
experimental stuff that people are less

351
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,140
to do we're looking at doing doing layer

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">1 or layer two extensions mostly up to</font>

being exchanged there and um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so of</font>

360
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,610
course we'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more traffic</font>

361
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,610
and I think that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

362
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,309

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,390
we look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> MCI which is the owner of</font>

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really a network service</font>

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,920
evolved the product towards from

remote peering you know allows us to

381
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,290
meet the needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a certain segment of</font>

lower cost is basically usage-based and

431
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,120
so there's some trade offer or some

432
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,030
cross over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to where that may be more</font>

433
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,850
economic than building out and the

434
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,649
transit is available so from this same

435
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,820
port you could either make an

436
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:47,190
arrangement for a full view or partial

437
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:51,250

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:55,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">a xt is a connection-oriented service</font>

439
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,800
and so it's not a bridging domain as is

440
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,360
typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change points it's</font>

441
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,399
connection-oriented service so it's and

442
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:05,889
the customers can attach either Giggy

443

444
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:13,390
though that's a diminishing quantity and

445
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,520
in a sense and all servers are delivered

446

don't think either a bitch are still

around but they wanted to connect

537

reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for starting a regional</font>

541
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,330
exchange point so I got a couple folks

542
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:47,860
together and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the original the</font>

543
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,730
original exchange was actually just the

544
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">two of them the hardware materialized</font>

545
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,809
and that's been true ever since we've

546
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,970
been real fortunate in that every time

547
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:59,860
we've needed new hardware donations have

548
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,220
just kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sprung up and that was true</font>

549
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:06,490
the first time around still true today

550
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:09,090
in 2001 we formally incorporated and so

551
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:14,350
we're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 501c3 now legitimate nonprofit</font>

552
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:17,049
no we're not oh do tell just a state

553
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:22,000
nonprofit okay with we're not legitimate

554
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:25,000
then but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll still take your money if</font>

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,270
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> donate um so what we've got</font>

556
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,740
is effectively each peer has has<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

557
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:34,150
share correct me if I'm wrong here Chris

558
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,990
okay and every year<font color="#CCCCCC"> we vote for 33 peers</font>

559
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,210
to be on the board of

560
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,230
actors serve a one-year term and that's

561
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,480
been real successful as far as

562
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,700
governance for us there's a there's

563
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,380
enough folks who are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

564
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,780
running the exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> and interested in</font>

00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">in seeing the the operations now granted</font>

566
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,500
it's been more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less the same board</font>

567
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,520
for the past three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact exactly</font>

568
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,530
the same board for the past three years

569
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,480
but that's worked out real well so let's

570
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,090
see since we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually buy any</font>

571
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,090
hardware and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't pay anybody we're</font>

572
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,070
able to have pretty much free peering

573
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,050
and that's true for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of our ports so</font>

574
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">where if you're used to paying at least</font>

575
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,309
a cross connect fear of port fee or

576
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:17,559
something somewhere we charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to</font>

577
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:19,629
anyone we've we've got about<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty peers</font>

578
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,030
and this doesn't show up well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it</font>

579
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:23,890
shows up better there than it does here

580
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:26,860
you can come to see we're hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

581
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:29,530
that Metcalfe's law is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of scaling</font>

582
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,030
in this direction we got a little bit of

583
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,178
the network effect happening between 2

584
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,620
o2 and o3 you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see but really</font>

585
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:40,390
in that last year we're starting to get

586
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:42,219
a hockey stick it's it's been kind of

587
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,160
cool to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see just from a personal</font>

588
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,230
perspective what what's required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

589
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,210
a small exchange point and if you've got

590
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,370
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your head that it's not too hard</font>

591
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,830
to run a switch and cluster a few

592
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,500
switches together and connect some folks

593
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,939
to a switch well you're absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

594
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,640
there's nothing rocket science here as

595
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:04,690
far as running a regional exchange point

596
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,690
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as easy as you'd expect I</font>

597
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:10,240
think because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the six is free it's been</font>

598
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,010
it's been a neat case study for what

599
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,490
happens when people can peer who

600
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:18,250
otherwise wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in that</font>

601
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,610
regard a bunch of our peers especially

602
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,800
if you look if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 2000 2001 a</font>

603
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:26,530
bunch of our peers were doing literally

604
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,678
a megabit 2 megabits to the exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

605
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,879
nothing at all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks you would</font>

606
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">have never gotten them to an exchange</font>

607
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,080
point before and they would have never

608
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,389
in some cases they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming aside from the six in some</font>

611
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of those folks that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were able</font>

612
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,990
to to go and get larger peers to come in

613
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:52,520
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look back like 1999</font>

614
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:55,490
thousand we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 20 peers and maybe</font>

615
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,020
300 megabits worth of traffic well a

acquired they've increased their

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,090
networks what have you so just

619
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,160
organically we've gone from a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

folks doing 2 megabits apiece to now a

<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't help either what we do</font>

that we're nonprofit or that there's

anything distinct about us versus any

other other vendors and for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-profit</font>

646
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:15,260
organization at least to me and one

647
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:17,300
staffed pretty pretty thinly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

648
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,580
impressive that's all from donations

00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,590
folks have donated their time donated

650

their their infrastructure to handle the

operations expertise so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

653
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,510
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> some real strong growth in</font>

654
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,969
the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that spend organic</font>

655
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:38,059
so we've seen a bunch more traffic from

656
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,340
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer to peer folks or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peer-to-peer</font>

657
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:42,139
traffic from existing folks and that's

658
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,360
that's driven some recent

659
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,250
interconnections we've gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shaw we've</font>

660
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,469
got in group telecom some of the other

661
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,929
cable providers out of Canada and folks

662
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,020
who are local millennium digital the

663
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:55,850
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's been kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of neat is</font>

664
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:59,210
we finally hit critical mass for my

665
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,649
definition with nntp we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font>

of user net provider

667

and they're there at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least to the point</font>

668
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,969
where if you go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're offering</font>

669
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,340
usenet services or you've got a ton of

670
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,430
eyeballs you've got some some reason to

671
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,990
carry usenet we're at least able to to

672
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,990
inspire you to connect if you're in

675
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:28,399
good third of it right now is nntp we're

676
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:31,880
quietly reliable and by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that</font>

00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:34,580
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do much we we sit</font>

678
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,420
there we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got our five switches and it</font>

exotic happening here we we do port

685
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,790
security so if you plug in and you plug

686
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,500
in the switch and you don't have

687

<font color="#E5E5E5">spanning tree disabled and you try to</font>

send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BPD you will set your port down</font>

number of allocated MAC addresses will

691
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,689
set the port down that served us pretty

692
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,040
darn well and and prevented what would

693
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been otherwise cascading failures</font>

694
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,190
so no individual peer has been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:23,900
cause any problems in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that regard and</font>

696
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:26,540
actually we've we've seen that the

697
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,700
switch fabric has been reliable and

698
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris you've seen this more than I have</font>

699
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,730
I think we're coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on five years</font>

700
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:37,010
now with no switching outage or or other

701
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:40,430
issue what we did have is we lost power

702
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:46,780
for for about an<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour it's on generator</font>

703
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:46,780
now and last but not least the

704
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:55,520
the gentleman who mentioned upgrading to

705
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:59,970
10 gige one of these fine folks yeah

706
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:03,270
well we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to 22 Giggy so we're</font>

707
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the right path okay yeah it's</font>

708
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,520
somewhat it's a good start um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be</font>

709
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,980
achieved 6040<font color="#E5E5E5"> load balancing so kind of</font>

710
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:15,810
a miracle we did etherchannel between

711
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:20,430
the two 4912 otherwise not much in the

712
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:22,500
way of interconnect engineering we we

713
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">got lucky though the week</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after we went</font>

714
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,330
and did did the the etherchannel

715
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,770
trunking which was was cat capacity

716
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,840
driven there's maybe a gig on that

717
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,300
circuit now um the week<font color="#CCCCCC"> after we went</font>

718
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and did that we got offered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to black</font>

719
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,409
diamonds for free so it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

720
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,139
we'll be doing a forklift upgrade in the

721
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,880
next month or two if anybody's driving

722
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:47,670
from san francisco to seattle let me

723
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:49,020
know we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some extreme</font>

724
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,680
hardware we loved it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back of your</font>

725
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">track new locations we we've actually</font>

726
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,260
heard interest and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of touches</font>

727
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,030
touches on the bottom topic we've heard

728
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,560
interest now from from folks in

729
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:07,170
Vancouver BC and as well from two small

730
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,460
cities in Washington for extending<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

731
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,040
switch fabric<font color="#E5E5E5"> to data centers in their</font>

732
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,920
space and the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually it</font>

733
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,350
would be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer coming in connecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

734
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchange point and and selling</font>

735
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,340
transport effectively selling an

736
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,410
extension to the switch so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

737
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,060
pretty pretty likely that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vancouver</font>

738
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,490
extension will happen so if you're in

739
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:29,610
Vancouver and want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach the six it's</font>

740
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:31,500
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get even easier then also if we</font>

741
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,149
could get if we could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

742
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,230
fiber cable we would try to get to

743
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:39,980
fisher plaza in the in seattle so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd</font>

744
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:43,860
say 5050 whether that happens this year

745
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,570
one note every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I bring up the sick</font>

746
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,580
somebody asks you know what do i do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

747
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,070
start a regional exchange point and I

748
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I think Seattle had some pretty</font>

749
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,840
unique characteristics we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> 900 miles</font>

751
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,330
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada so we had this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> built-in</font>

752
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,360
work

753
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:03,360
built instead of peers ready to come in

754
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,520
and connect but what I wouldn't want to

755
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,959
see happening is is every little city

756
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,170
starting an exchange point just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

757
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,570
sake of having one so what I tell those

758
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:14,670
folks is it's a means not an end and in

759
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of Seattle we needed it at the</font>

760
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,870
time and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we still do but if</font>

761
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,660
you're in you know a city that doesn't

762
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:25,199
need additional interconnect capacity be

763
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,930
happy and i'll be giving tours if

764
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:36,510
anybody's interested or questions what

765
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:43,620
have you Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Celeste from Pacific</font>

766
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:46,590
web hi I'm here representing Pacific

767
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,229
wave at this moment and Pacific wave is

768
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,820
a collaborative project<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

769
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,930
Pacific<font color="#CCCCCC"> Northwest Giga pop here in</font>

770
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:57,649
Seattle and scenic which is the

771
00:32:53,930 --> 00:33:02,040
educational network in California and

772
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:05,330
I'm from USC so we're collaborating as

773
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:09,629
is the University<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Washington as well</font>

774
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:11,189
so why do I put up a glyph map well you

775
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,700
can't see it real well but there's a

776
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">little circle on the west coast and this</font>

777
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,440
part of the global lambda integrated

778
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,530
facility is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pacific wave we're providing</font>

779
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,780
services to the glyph community and the

780
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:27,690
reason i put this map up is to show all

781
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,960
the different educational networks that

782
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:33,870
are coming in and interconnecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

783
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,240
that is part of we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

784
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:43,080
small piece of this larger international

785
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:48,900
effort so we have three locations in Los

786
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:52,889
Angeles connected by 10 gigabit um that

787
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:55,860
is connected through Sunnyvale and in

788
00:33:52,890 --> 00:34:00,540
July we'll have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> locations in</font>

789
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:03,899
sunnyvale and that has a national<font color="#E5E5E5"> lambda</font>

790
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:07,250
rail lambda that goes from Sunnyvale

791
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:13,190
into seattle and it's

792
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:15,139
next door in the westin I don't expect

793
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone to read all of these but this is</font>

794
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:21,590
to show a little bit about how we're

795
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,750
deploying our VLAN topology it's complex

796
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it got even more complex when we</font>

797
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:29,239
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the jumbo vlans should be</font>

798
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,429
segregated from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard veal and so</font>

799
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,699
everybody who's capable of doing and

800
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:36,950
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> say jumbo it's 9,000 MTU so</font>

801
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:40,520
anyone who's on that has to agree that

802
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:42,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to peer at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 9000 on the</font>

803
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,918
switches are set to the highest value<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

804
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:47,719
they can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do higher than 9,000</font>

805
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,759
but it but at any rate now people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

806
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:53,750
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be capable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing</font>

807
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,760
the standard 1500 m to you but also the

808
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">jumbo because many of the research</font>

809
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:04,750
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually doing things that</font>

810
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:09,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">require jumbo frames so features</font>

811
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:11,840
activities plans as we were asked to do

812
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,960
we have separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs for standard and</font>

813
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:18,050
jumbo as i mentioned multicast is in the

814
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,390
same unicast VLAN<font color="#E5E5E5"> via PM snooping so we</font>

815
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do a separate connection for</font>

816
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:27,319
multicast and ipv6 is in the same VLAN

817
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:29,390
as our ipv4 traffic and that is

818
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically so people can operate their</font>

819
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:36,650
conventional dual stack interface and

820
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:39,980
run native ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> um we will probably be</font>

821
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,660
providing lambda services at some part

822
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,730
and we're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it for some</font>

823
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:47,930
projects such as cave wave and

824
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:50,600
ultralight ultralight is a project<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

825
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:53,120
is run in the high energy physics groups

826
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,700
and it interconnects people all over the

827
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:59,600
world and our particular hub is through

828
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:01,549
the Caltech<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-energy physics we're</font>

829
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:05,000
actually bringing up connections with

830
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:06,870
NSF grants from translight we're

831
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,370
actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be bringing in</font>

832
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:13,380
connections with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arnett folks and it</font>

833
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,779
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through Hawaii and picking</font>

834
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,170
up all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> international telescopes so</font>

835
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:22,560
that we can facilitate a lot of

836
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,270
international connections to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

837
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,779
view the<font color="#CCCCCC"> telescopes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are available</font>

838
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:30,509
there in Hawaii the ren project is

839
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,720
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> an NSF grant that is assisting</font>

840
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:38,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> south american community going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:44,100
and connecting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tijuana San Diego into</font>

843
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,080
Pacific wave at that point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be</font>

844
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:50,250
bringing in all of our South American

845
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:53,580
and Central American partners as well so

846
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:55,620
what's for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future well they're</font>

847
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,660
actually talking about us doing peering

848
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:01,049
at layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> one which is going to be</font>

849
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:03,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting a lot of that's way out in</font>

850
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:06,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the future but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's researchers</font>

851
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:08,430
working on it and the other interesting

852
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,040
thing that's going on is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

853
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:13,470
people build lambdas across these

854
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,140
infrastructures that are controlled by

855
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:18,660
many different entities and that also

856
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,250
brings up the fact that we have funding

857
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,629
to do measurement studies as well

858
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:25,800
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also an interesting an</font>

859
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,690
interesting issue of how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

860
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,720
measurement when you're not allowed to

861
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,250
really see into the devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">different entity so those are just a few</font>

864
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:42,210
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be</font>

865
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:45,660
issues for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us in the future so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

866
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,920
I put down<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few of the sites that</font>

867
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,990
people want to look a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

868
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,930
where the glyphs site is the National

00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,189
lambda rail the IE EF is doing a lot of

this work which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

presentations for the rent project I

874
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,490
don't believe they have their<font color="#CCCCCC"> website up</font>

875
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:08,310
and my one last<font color="#E5E5E5"> final comment is I</font>

876
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,830
apologize that we're integrating three

at the Pacific wavenet site but stay

00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">are up here now will actually be</font>

available on the website now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

889
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:54,320
open that up for questions if anybody

890
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:57,740
has questions Chris Caputo I'll topia

891
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:02,000
and also Seattle internet exchange the

892
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:04,220
six has an extension point or extension

893
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,230
switch policy and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a few</font>

894
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,109
extension switches one with<font color="#CCCCCC"> packs</font>

895
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:10,460
Seattle I'd like to mention and combats

896
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,770
communications which is now<font color="#E5E5E5"> firecloud</font>

897
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,540
Colo centers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering if</font>

00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:18,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cortland I was wondering if Troy could</font>

899
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,880
talk about experiences with you know

900
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,260
interacting with essentially other

901
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,180
vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware in a switch fabric</font>

902
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,920
let's see the the sign says to speak

903
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,790
clearly and speak directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

904
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,830
microphone so I'll do so the the policy

905
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:37,550
is that the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of directors of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

906
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:40,369
six can approve or reject applications

907
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:43,130
to to have folks connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their own</font>

908
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:44,300
switches so in this case if you've got a

909
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,850
data center let's say you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

910
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,580
westin or somewhere nearby and you want

911
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,830
to offer the six as a service either

912
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,710
free or paid to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your data center</font>

913
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,869
customers you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can apply to actually run</font>

914
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:59,390
an extension of the switch of the switch

915
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:02,210
fabric and we get access so we're able

916
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log in we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do SMP queries</font>

917
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,619
and get logs and what have you but the

918
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,119
actual primary operation is the the

919
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:13,130
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the data center</font>

920
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:15,740
provider so in that case it's a little

921
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,560
questionable as to as to what the trust

922
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,700
relationship is we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

923
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,430
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do anything that</font>

924
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,529
would either compromise the integrity of

925
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,450
the data that's passing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> arps moving</font>

926
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:29,080
as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something that would</font>

927
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:31,160
compromise the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the switch fabric itself</font>

928
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,910
become the root bridge and have all

929
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,500
sorts of fun so there's been there was a

930
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:40,549
learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> curve the first two or three of</font>

931
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,500
those both for me and for other people I

932
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:47,060
think I think we've gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> past the</font>

933
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:49,610
hurdle now and we see see a pretty

934
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,440
smooth<font color="#CCCCCC"> interconnection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

935
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:56,570
two have been pretty darn smooth for the

936
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,280
first two we ran into folks who who

937
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:02,060
maybe weren't as familiar with broadcast

938
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,800
domains as they could be so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

939
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:09,080
seeing traffic we we would rather not

940
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:11,510
have ospf hsrp so that was a little

941
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">funky but it's been it's been a good</font>

942
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:18,740
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> overall know and and we connect</font>

943
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:23,000
with with pax<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle which has been</font>

944
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:25,279
totally smooth absolutely seamless this

945
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,840
is for Celeste I believe your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name was</font>

946
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,870
who are you and where are you from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

947
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,820
Matthew tag from yahoo and this may seem

948
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a bit of a naive question so I</font>

949
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,890
apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> in advance but it starts to</font>

950
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,440
appear to me is you outlined your

951
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:43,400
multiple switch interconnects up and

952
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,800
down the coast that you're dabbling a

953
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,050
little bit in somewhat of a transit a

954
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,820
localized transit relationship in that

955
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:51,260
if you connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a switch in one</font>

956
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,620
location it seems you can peer with

957
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:57,290
people in another location do you find

958
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself potentially competing with</font>

959
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:02,870
transit providers in any way or is this

960
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:05,240
scene as completely different space um

961
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,770
we've done a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

962
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,439
that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't using it for</font>

963
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:12,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">transport for commercial purposes but</font>

964
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,440
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things because we are</font>

965
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,830
handling a lot of trans specific links

966
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're a research entity may only be able</font>

967
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to peer either in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle or LA we're</font>

968
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,420
facilitating them being able to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

969
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:29,390
peers in another location depending on

970
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:32,210
their submarine cable landing so that

971
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:34,850
they can exchange traffic so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

972
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,700
basically to help facilitate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

973
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,880
that many of

974
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,310
entities cannot afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in more</font>

975
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,060
than one location in the united states

976
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:48,799
or at least on the west coast so yes we

977
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:51,180
are allowing that to happen but it's

978
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,560
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing with people</font>

979
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,759
who are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> available in their local so</font>

980
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,009
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your acceptable use</font>

981
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,140
policy on it is what prevents it from

982
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:06,900
being turned into a full-fledged transit

983
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:13,109
sort of exchange yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you any</font>

984
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:14,910
other questions yeah go ahead Mike okay

985
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:16,500
I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask a question of Troy and you</font>

986
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not hit me he's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next close</font>

987
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,869
next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> um first of all can I hire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

988
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:23,578
to do my cabling because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

989
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:25,109
really nice neat slide of his broom

990
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:28,079
cupboard with all this beautiful cabling

991
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:29,578
in it so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get cabling tips but</font>

992
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,680
the kudos to our facilities team

993
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:33,810
actually that's take no credit for that

994
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool that's like the neatest</font>

995
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,060
exchange point I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen in a</font>

996
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:41,009
long time that's so sweet it's beautiful

997
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,420
anyway and the serious question was you

998
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,540
were talking about a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> extreme</font>

999
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,940
boxes um right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if I think of the</font>

1000
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,529
Western building just over there it's

1001
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,609
got your<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch fabric in which is cisco</font>

1002
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,690
and it's got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packs one which is</font>

1003
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:56,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">xtreme um if you enter the extreme stuff</font>

1004
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,260
and everybody knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love redundancy</font>

1005
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:00,480
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love having like multiple</font>

1006
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,730
selections of vendors and and that kind

1007
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,710
of thing um what you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how do you</font>

1008
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:07,109
feel if you do you feel anything at all

1009
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:09,869
about eroding the vendor redundancy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1010
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:11,759
currently exists within the Western by

1011
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:19,319
moving to say an exit an extreme switch

1012
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:21,420
fabric over somebody else's well good

1013
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:24,810
question I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I feel any</font>

1014
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:27,329
emotion about eroding the switch

1015
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:29,310
redundancy in terms of vendors I would

1016
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:32,089
feel emotion in fact I'd be very sad if

1017
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,589
i had to erode the the features

1018
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:37,049
redundancy in that if there's things we

1019
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:38,750
do now to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> ourselves that we</font>

1020
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,640
couldn't do with a different platform

1021
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,579
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we lost any features along the</font>

1022
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,440
way i would i would stumble but in terms

1023
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:49,380
of what we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a bare-bones</font>

1024
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,619
enough that that pretty much any switch

1025
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font>

1026
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:55,049
should be able to pull it off but no I

1027
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:57,210
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see an intrinsic problem with with</font>

1028
00:44:55,049 --> 00:45:03,299
having the official West Western

1029
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:05,099
building ixb extreme res if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1030
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:08,339
mind deferring to woody yeah all right

1031
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah just just a sec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike also that sort</font>

1032
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:16,619
of calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the six to predict the</font>

1033
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:20,129
actions of switch and data which is

1034
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:23,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe not necessarily a good position to</font>

1035
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:26,970
for them to depend upon being able to do

1036
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:31,499
right so it's quite possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to switch</font>

1037
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:33,509
and data may in that facility as in palo

1038
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:36,299
alto switch to a different platform in

1039
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:41,490
which case the redundancy would be just

1040
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:43,829
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now Richard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> steenburgen in</font>

1041
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:46,169
layer Troy you mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

1042
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:48,359
gotten some free black diamonds and I

1043
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:49,710

Palo Alto and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're not</font>
