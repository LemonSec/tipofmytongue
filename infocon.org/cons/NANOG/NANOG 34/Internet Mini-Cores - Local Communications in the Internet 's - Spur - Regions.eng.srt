00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,429
the Santa conference in Bangladesh so

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,800
it's a bit more applicable to that sort

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,840
of region than to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know well</font>

most of you are used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to working in so</font>

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,430
it's here largely as an indication of

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,789
what's going on in other parts of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">world and hopefully that does something</font>

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,660

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,640
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the way the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is</font>

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,769
metropolitan areas what<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which is</font>

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,750
the the major metropolitan areas of

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,440
North America Western Europe East Asia

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,420
and a few other places and within that

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,280
area there's really good connectivity

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,270
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fiber lots of redundancy</font>

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,040
lots of cheap bandwidth and you can

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,430
pretty much take for granted the ability

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,189
to send large amounts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> data really</font>

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,070
quickly between urban areas the

27
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,189
developed world but in the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,750
world you've generally got lots of isp

29
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,339
is in a region which each have

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,110
connectivity to that core but it's

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,689
separate connectivity and they often

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't connect to each other and</font>

33
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,158
connections to that core can go a very

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,700
long way and they're often satellite

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,960
links to other continents and since they

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,579
don't connect to each other even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,479
local connectivity uses those

38
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,610
connections so if you're wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

39
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,280
know say make a voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> over IP call to</font>

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">your neighbor chances are you're going</font>

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go halfway around the world and back</font>

42
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,570
to do that so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet often doesn't</font>

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,340
work very well in those places so here

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,758
we've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> racetrack that I've been</font>

45
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:01,979
calling the packet world tour this goes

46

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think was about 20 miles outside of</font>

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,470

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,110

50
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,400
believe 11 time 11 time zones away from

<font color="#E5E5E5">Nepal satellite to Honolulu fiber to Los</font>

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,510

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:30,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> satellite and back down to Nepal and</font>

55
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:32,310
so in that case we've we've done

56
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,330
basically the equivalent of a circuit

57
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:40,020
around the world to go 20 miles and

58
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:50,880
we've spent 1.7 seconds doing so use

59
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:52,709
ipv6 your hawks um and this is the

60
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,190
example that I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

61
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,810
more familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and this IP address I</font>

62
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,220
traced to is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a random IP address</font>

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,630
that didn't appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be firewalled off</font>

64
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,260
in a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> block the tray strap but</font>

65
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say a traceroute that goes across</font>

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nepal internet exchange in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Katmandu</font>

67
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,370
and takes 24 milliseconds to go eh not

68
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,810
much shorter distance so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a way</font>

69
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">in which the internet differs</font>

70
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,730
significantly from traditional phone

71
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,620
networks on traditional phone networks

72
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,079
there's a huge cost advantage to making

73
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">local phone calls and you know</font>

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,380
definitions of local have shifted

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,299
allowed over the last several years said

76
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,920
you know at this point from my cell

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,680
phone the local calling area is the

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,079
entire US but there's still a big

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,730
difference in cost between calling the

80
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,560
US and calling various other<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of</font>

81
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:45,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world from it and local phone calls</font>

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,310
tend to be pretty reliable because you

83
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,000
know they're the connectivity is good

84
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,070
well international phone calls are are a

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,959
different story if you're calling some

86
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,000
poorly connected part of the world often

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,769
you know you end up giving up and trying

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,760
to call again the next day but most

89
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,489
people don't notice when the

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,410
international phone networks break if

91
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know because if most of the phone</font>

same

100
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,070
you can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anybody anywhere in the</font>

101
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,310
world as easily as if you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

102
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,560
somebody local and this gets talked

103
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,910
about as a feature and sometimes it is

104
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,570
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to talk to</font>

106
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:45,440

107
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,590
from the scent but when look but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what in</font>

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,120
fact happens with this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

109
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,130
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason that distance seems</font>

110
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,900
somewhat insignificant is not that

111
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,090
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like it's local its</font>

112
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,729
that in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of places everything looks</font>

113
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,669
like it's long distance and this reduces

114
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:03,469
local communications to the the

115
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,549
flakiness level that we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

116
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,080
international connectivity so this

117
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,470
manifests itself in a couple of ways

118
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,719
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of cost and reliability so</font>

if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at bandwidth costs in the</font>

156
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,609
to set up very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Seattle where</font>

they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big downtown skyscraper</font>

158
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,599
where most of the ISPs are and the

00:06:52,169 --> 00:07:01,799
exchange point is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> basement and</font>

160
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:04,289
the ISPs in Perth and in the Powell and

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,900
in a bunch of other places they're

162
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,460
starting to notice that this is an issue

163
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,109
and charging their custom you know and

164
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,580
doing traffic measurement and charging

165
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,969
their customers occasionally so I

166
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe both then in Perth and in</font>

167
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:21,889
Katmandu you've got a lot of ISPs that

168
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:25,258
are offering free cut that are offering

169
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:27,629
free or flat rate local connectivity and

170
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,479
then charging per bit for stuff that

171
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:32,490
goes over<font color="#E5E5E5"> their international links and</font>

172
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,159
in New Zealand there seem to be two

173
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,330
products global transit and domestic

174
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:41,190

175
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:43,020
differently and this also<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps even</font>

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,819
what internet connectivity looked like

188
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,008
at that point the press reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font>

189
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,139
find reported dead as an outage of

00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,629
internet and international phone service

191
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,430
which makes the internet look pretty

192
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:26,569
fragile if local phone service continued

193
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:31,020
to work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet just fell over</font>

194
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:33,329
so what really happened there and yeah

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is pure speculation on my part but</font>

00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:36,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is a fairly</font>

197
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,870
realistic scenario and if anybody knows

198
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,490
more about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> please let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there</font>

199
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,740
is a local exchange point there and I

200
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,100
think the ISP is there are reasonably

201
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,110
well peered so layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 connectivity</font>

202
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,370
between the ISPs should have continued

203
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work</font>

204
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:57,550
but there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> route DNS server there</font>

205
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:59,349
which means the dns lookups at least if

206
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,779
anybody reloaded name server and flush

207
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,139
the cache which you know servers reboot

208
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:08,920
a lot in places for power isn't reliable

209
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:11,139
would have would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant that anybody</font>

211
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:15,970
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have worked and even with dns</font>

212
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,209
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet as your</font>

214
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:25,420
places that's still a problem so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

215
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,769
an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's certainly not isolated</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sri lanka that just made a good</font>

218
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:36,009
external connectivity has has these

219
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:38,019
problems and in regions with satellite

220
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:40,959
connectivity these problems are treated

221
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:45,639
as somewhat normal at PCH we've got a

222
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,050
lot of our anycast dns nodes in on you

223
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,790
know in places that are satellite

224
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,258
connected and our management

225
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,029
connectivity for them often goes down

226
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:58,029
for hours or even sometimes days of the

227
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:59,439
time so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a a somewhat</font>

228
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:01,779
different way that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

229
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:05,800
about internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering in order to</font>

230
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:08,550
to accommodate regions where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're long</font>

231
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">distance connectivity is is hard to do</font>

232
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,130
so that the current core works well for

233
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,380
the parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world that it covers</font>

234
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,399
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the world really</font>

235
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,250
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to send everything</font>

236
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,199
through it so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we instead think of</font>

237
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,300
this as lots of regional cores where

238
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:23,889
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your local</font>

239
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,170
infrastructure all the local stuff you

240
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:29,410
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to and then long distance</font>

241
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,910
circuits that you use for like you know

242
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,810
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to talk to people far away</font>

243
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:38,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">or talk to talk to servers far away then</font>

244
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,149
that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more sense and allows a</font>

245
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:43,149
lot of it and would allow these areas to

246
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:44,230
be a lot more self-sufficient and if the

247
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:46,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is going to replace the</font>

248
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,060
traditional phone network for voice over

249
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,560
IP stuff we can't have it being flaky

250
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,138
while the we can't have it being a lot

251
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">more flaky than the phone network is so</font>

252
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:57,639
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there the first step is</font>

253
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,130
obviously to keep local traffic local

254
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an which can either be done with an</font>

255
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,430
exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> point or a monopoly transit</font>

256
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,950
provider

257
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,069
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange point all the ISPs</font>

258
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">should have access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to local peering and</font>

259
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,130
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that everybody needs</font>

260
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">to appear with everybody else because if</font>

261
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,240
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy transit from somebody who peers</font>

262
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,640
locally then that's essentially paying

263
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,050
someone else to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pairing for you</font>

264
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,430
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale is pretty well because it</font>

265
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,189
doesn't really put a hard limit on the

266
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,510
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> participants in the market now</font>

267
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,100
you can also do this with the monopoly

268
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,689
transit provider which has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

effect of keeping local traffic local

270
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,209
until somebody decides to compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

it and then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to where you</font>

273
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,459

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">or lower costs so that doesn't work</font>

275
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:44,339
nearly as well but exchange points

276
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">really aren't enough here because</font>

277
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,790
keeping your local traffic local doesn't

278
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,729
help if what you need to talk to isn't

279

283
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,079
places with pretty poor connectivity and

284
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,329
start looking over people's shoulders

285
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:08,939
and what are they doing they're emailing

286

their other local friends with hotmail

less is figuring out what top level and

second level and so forth domains to put

VoIP services as we we move from PSTN to

what else is a critical service is

<font color="#E5E5E5">not all that easily replicable and you</font>

know what about Windows Update what

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,280
about various other content providers

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,780
this is really something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that content</font>

deploying their servers who's the who's

375
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,819
doesn't also percolate having servers

376
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,410
outside the region and this helps a lot

377
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,060
if there is a local exchange point but

378
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,350
without one that doesn't do much because

379
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,969
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have connectivity going out of</font>

433
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:37,679
comment to the whole community here is

434
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,360
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are deploying content in other</font>

435
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,340
countries we are building data centers

436
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,520
in other countries we are finding

437
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:47,010
network operators that will peer with us

438
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,320
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the united states even though</font>

439
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,340
they are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that remote country and we</font>

440
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,168
have a data center in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote</font>

441
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,168
country but they will not appear with us

442
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:57,330
in that remote country so content goes

443
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:59,669
from remote country to palo alto

444
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,678
california across the circuit we have

445
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:03,419
back across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the circuit they have to the</font>

446
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,659
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they were six kilometers</font>

447
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,400
away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> us this is a problem people</font>

448
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">not from the content provider side</font>

449
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,659
necessarily but from the network

450
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,270
operators who decide that for some

451
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:17,940
reason it's better to peer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> california</font>

452
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,129
than in their own country if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

453
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,429
solve that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we can make Steve a</font>

454
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:25,140
lot happier<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I think that I think</font>

455
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,450
that's an issue that depends a lot on on

456
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,600
which remote countries you're going to

457
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:33,390
if you're somewhere where the the local

458
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,639
ISPs have good fiber connectivity to the

459
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,440
US it's very tempting for them to do

460
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,780
that because they can keep encroachers

461
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,830
out of their local market I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

462
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,480
they get into the point where they're

463
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,370
paying thousands of dollars a megabit

464
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,600
for their satellite connectivity they're

465
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,520
a lot more eager for that sort of thing

466
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,770
but the point is the content providers

467
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,549
are going to the countries and it's not

468

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,030
actually planning to the previous talk

474
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,149
it's just a minor typo it's fixed oh it

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:15,629
was five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago sorry refresh your</font>

cache and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rudolph from Boeing the</font>

477
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,020
question that at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then I kind of</font>

478
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,150
have about your whole talk is I agree

479
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:25,050
that that making infrastructure more

480
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:27,210
sound in catastrophe situation is

481
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,110
certainly a good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but in my mind it</font>

482
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,370
comes down to one of two things

483
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:34,320
economics or regulation and in general

484
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,300
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see economics at least I don't</font>

485
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,990
see economics pushing people to move a

486
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,550
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these services into these</font>

487
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,410
far-reaching areas so then you asked

488
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,570
questions about regulation and I don't

489
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,880
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if regulations you see regulations</font>

490
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,970
changing such that would encourage or

491
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,990
cause local ISPs to actually perform

492
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:58,650
these services locally well I I think

493
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:01,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as you know as far as big content</font>

494
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:05,160
hosters in in other places are concerned

495
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:08,040
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nepal or Bangladesh or something says</font>

496
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,020
yahoo must install a local server here I

497
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,710
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's going to have any</font>

498
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:17,760
effect as far as getting the ISPs to

499
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:22,890
connect to each other locally I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

500
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,150
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's you know being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

501
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,130
that's being talked about in some places

502
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,720
and you know regulation is always scary

503
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,120
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet because the regulator's</font>

504
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,800
often don't know much about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and well</font>

505
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,600
but but regulators could not knowing

506
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,399
much about it right rules like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

507
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,260
cannot connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yahoo in San Jose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

508
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,940
must connect to yahoo locally right and

509
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,050
what are the ramifications of that how

510
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,640
do you enforce that um but oh I think

511
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,500
we're going to we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to wrap</font>

512
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,840
this up because we've got 45 more slides

513
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,740
and we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so bill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ted</font>

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,380
there we go really quickly to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andres</font>

516
00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:00,870
question regulation that names yahoo is

517
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:05,130
probably really bad regulation on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

519
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,700
talking with regulators about in

520
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,530
countries where they really want to

521
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">regulate this kind of thing is to say</font>

that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a licensed</font>

domestic traffic without it crossing the

526
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,689
border right that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very generic</font>

527
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,969
regulation it's not technology specific

528
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,530
and it doesn't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to peer</font>

529
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,730
you could go and buy transit from

530
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,280
somebody who peers and you'd be

531
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,010
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's the the level</font>

532
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,940
of generic kind of rebel regulation

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's relatively safe thank you Bill</font>
