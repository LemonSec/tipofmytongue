00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of debate amongst the</font>

149
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,199
panelist if needed after the last

150
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,818
question Jerry Dixon is going to address

151
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,889
the audience and then professor Matthews

152
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,690
is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address the audience so with</font>

153
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:09,849
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get started the first</font>

154
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:12,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is and this question is going</font>

155
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:14,590
to be answered<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Patrick Gilmore if one</font>

156
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,659
company discovers a vulnerability and

157
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,729
the impact is in its infancy is it worth

158
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,069
announcing it to all customers and or at

159
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,599
the operator community and the follow-on

160
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:27,310
to that will be does that create a

161
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:28,419
larger vulnerability hello so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

162
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">to answer the second question first</font>

163
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,948
because it's easier the answer is

164
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:34,060
obviously yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a secret</font>

165
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:36,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you give more people the information</font>

166
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,650
of that secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's higher likelihood</font>

167
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,520
that the secret will leak out I don't

168
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">think anybody's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have any</font>

169
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,789
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

170
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem with my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer for the first</font>

171
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,750
question the first question can be

172
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,370
broken up<font color="#E5E5E5"> into two subsets there's</font>

173
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously vulnerabilities that aren't</font>

174
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do any damage to the Internet</font>

175
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,650
those kind of vulnerabilities I honestly

176
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,789
think should be announced whenever they

177
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,440
come out if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do any</font>

178
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,779
damage let us know we'll work around

179
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,180
what small effects they can have don't

180
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,069
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about hiding them the second type</font>

181
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,349
of vulnerability is kind of do affect

182
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:07,539
the internet on a large basis can take

183
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:10,349
out large providers or entire swathes of

184
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:12,729
the core of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as they say</font>

185
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:14,860
that type of vulnerability can further

186
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:16,090
be broken down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> two more sets the</font>

187
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,159
kind with workarounds and the kind

188
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,539
without workarounds kind of with

189
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,740
workarounds is going to be addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

190
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,818
a later question so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

191
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go the kind without workarounds</font>

192
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,330
personally and I need to stress this is

193
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">me not my company not my CEO not the</font>

194
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,870
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the panel but personally I think</font>

195
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,549
that that should not be announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

196
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,740
think if you found a vulnerability if

197
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,659
you're a router vendor and you've

198
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,610
noticed a stack overflow that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no</font>

199
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,439
workaround for this should be kept

200
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,729
secret it should be worked on internally

201
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,260
until there is a

202
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,550
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should not let it out you</font>

203
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,589
shouldn't let anybody else know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

204
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,819
obviously if it becomes known for

205
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,750
whatever reason if somebody else finds

206
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,949
it or if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaks out of your</font>

207
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,839
organization that's a different story

208
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:54,579
but as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's</font>

209
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,290
a vulnerability I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I exploit in</font>

210
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,689
the wild<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this vulnerability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

211
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,279
shouldn't let anybody else know talked

212
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this with a few of you out there</font>

213
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who aren't here today</font>

214
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,240
and there was a suggestion which I think

215
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,699
it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful um and that is if</font>

216
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,079
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vendor and you found that</font>

217
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:13,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a vulnerability and there's no</font>

218
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">workaround you start working on the bug</font>

219
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,750
most people can tell when they're going

220
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to have code available for</font>

221
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,920
the fix it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exact science but</font>

222
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,870
most people can tell most vendors can

223
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,319
tell when the bug fix is going to be

224
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,050
available it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be useful if what you</font>

225
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,180
did is announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the community that</font>

226
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,060
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be an upgrade path for</font>

you know iOS Juno s whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bug is</font>

228
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,040
in in a week two weeks whatever you know

229
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,889
friday at four o'clock on<font color="#CCCCCC"> May 26th or</font>

230
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,810
whatever is available this was asked

231
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:45,880
from several people because they did not

232
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find out on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Friday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at four</font>

233
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,029
o'clock after everybody in Europe had

234
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,319
gone home that they may have this

235
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,149
massive vulnerability and they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

236
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">help create all the routers today they'd</font>

237
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,050
like to schedule maintenance windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

238
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">found that to be reasonable there was</font>

239
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,469
some comments about well what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

240
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,910
happen are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to assume this</font>

241
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,560
is a bug of course they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

242
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,630
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bug but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of times you</font>

243
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have enough information or it may</font>

244
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,480
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible to give out information</font>

245
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,399
without giving away the vulnerability

246
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,660
and even if people are going to assume

247
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:12,670
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about or notice that they're up</font>

248
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,529
streams are upgrading their routers or

249
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,670
anything else it's still nice to know

250
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:17,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information ahead of time so that</font>

251
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,849
you can schedule have resources

252
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,889
available and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get ready to do this</font>

253
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,329
upgrade once you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

254
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:23,560
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision at that time</font>

255
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:26,199
it's a lot better than trying to

256
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,180
scramble so that's my answer to the

257
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:30,180
question any questions from the panel

258
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,300
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick that was too easy</font>

259
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,640
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> two is too crispy later and the</font>

260
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is is announcing the</font>

261
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,510
vulnerability putting tools into script

262
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,490
kiddies hackers angry people's hands and

263
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,439
could this be prevented with a follow-on

264
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,880
of should vulnerability announcements be

265
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:58,600
restricted to a selective group to

266
00:10:51,880 --> 00:11:01,360
prevent this I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the first part</font>

267
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,640
of the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yes and no I don't</font>

268
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,690
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a clear-cut</font>

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,790
definitive answer from everything that

270
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,580
I've read<font color="#CCCCCC"> in everybody that I've talked</font>

271
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,010
with there's definitely different levels

272
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,080
of sophistication of vulnerabilities

273
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:17,290
some vulnerabilities are easy to

274
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,570
reproduce and create a tool set to take

275
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,730
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that vulnerability and some</font>

276
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,400
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not some are very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to exploit in</font>

277
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,690
the wild while others are not so I think

278
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first half but the question is</font>

279
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,060
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a common sense how easy is this</font>

280
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,530
going to be to exploit and how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

281
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact is it going to have if it's</font>

282
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:41,260
not going to have much impact then that

283
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:45,490
probably changes changes it to be yes to

284
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,080
the second half I believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

285
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,690
really strongly in this we actually went

286
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,940
quite quite a few rounds with vendors on

287
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,620
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year that releasing</font>

288
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,930

00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,680

298

or what the patch versions of code are

of opt-in system

giving it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> general public is is</font>

314
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:59,060
the right answer but I firmly believe

315
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,520
that giving it that limiting it by

327
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,890
would you say that your opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on us on</font>

328
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,740
the previous slide would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

334
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,750
all and the answer is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

335
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,589
should unless there's a workaround and

336
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,250
then that's going to be covered

337
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:52,380
elsewhere if it is going to be if it is

338
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,030
going to be released although I haven't

339
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,010
thought up my complete answer this I

340
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,939
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't find any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fault and what</font>

341
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris is saying it does give a</font>

competitive advantage to the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

343
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,680
I do know that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the people who</font>

344
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">got you know ignoring the press release</font>

345
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,030
incident I do know that sales guys from

346
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big networks we're telling their</font>

if anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens you know we get it</font>

349
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,439
first this wasn't necessarily written

350
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,930
down but the sales guys are saying this

351
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,810
in sales meetings and that's you know

352
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,339
that does do something to my sense of

353
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,130
fairness not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

354
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,520
should be fair but it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

355
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:31,170
thanks question 3 this question is going

356
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,970
to be addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Aaron Hughes what if</font>

357
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,040
routers switches and network objects had

358
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,140
a smart update feature much like windows

update or software update<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple</font>

approximately a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-minute outage so</font>

365
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a controversial issue and</font>

366
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,140
it'll certainly at least raise a bunch

367
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,390
of opinions about ways to implement it

368
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,180
and definitions of knobs or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font>

369
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:07,400
possible so leaving that<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

370
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:08,959
my thoughts on on the issue I've not

371
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,520
completed the research on this year so

372
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,360
so there's no empirical evidence the

373
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,550
next statement is a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

374
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,280
accurate I'm sure if Casey<font color="#CCCCCC"> Claffey were</font>

375
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,420
up here she bumped me on the head that

376
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,819
being said I'm making<font color="#CCCCCC"> a general</font>

377
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,349
assumption that ISPs and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> X's and</font>

378
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,050
carriers deal with amplifiers

379
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,060
continuously and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those amplifiers are</font>

380
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,890
generally downstream of the ice pzi<font color="#CCCCCC"> X's</font>

381
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,670
and carriers so this slide really

382
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">focuses on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprises and alike</font>

383
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:37,280
this is proposing that we change the

384
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,170
default on the routers to be more secure

385
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,630
that is block the majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

386
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,189
inbound traffic change the default so

387
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,010
that we somehow detect the public inside

388
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,740
space and and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default install anti</font>

389
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">spoof filters and of course the big</font>

390
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,250
controversial issue is is we somehow set

391
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,260
up some sort of auto update where

392
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,000
routers much like<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows and OS x boxes</font>

393
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,740
check for updates and some regular basis

394
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,140
and automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix the routers how</font>

395
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,730
great would that<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

396
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,170
questions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out of this first</font>

397
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,210
you know ken enterprises deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

398
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:12,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">five-minute outage on a somewhat regular</font>

399
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,280
basis can they modify customer SLA s to

400
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,530
allow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of maintenance and</font>

401
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,819
on the other extreme would some

402
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:23,530
enterprises even notice and and what

403
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,970
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> this really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solve so perhaps will</font>

404
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,459
will reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of viruses or</font>

405
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,490
open relays or attacks on unsecured

406
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,020
hosts I believe it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also believe</font>

407
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,060
that this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be enough of a change</font>

408
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,160
that the impact is some of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

409
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,689
regular code<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade and a reboot would</font>

410
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,370
be far<font color="#CCCCCC"> less impact than the average big</font>

attack you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next one</font>

412
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:50,120
maybe that's it for this slug part<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

413
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:52,820
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick question so</font>

414
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,830
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how router is having some</font>

415
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,830
auto update feature is gonna do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

416
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,180
for BOTS or open relays at all but

417
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,370
personally I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see it because</font>

418
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,050
they're not generally bots or overlays

419
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,660
sign for some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure Rob</font>

420
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,550
Thompson III absolutely agree that it

421
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,439
that auto update won't necessarily fix

422
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,470
those things which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which is why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

423
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,209
also mention the sort of default config

424
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,270
on the router I really like to see that

425
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,130
out of the box it's it is secure it's

426
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,930
it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get packets in and out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

427
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,209
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network it should be that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

428
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,429
you should only have inbound permitted

429
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,520
for things that are normal services and

430
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,990
and if anti spoof were implemented by

431
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,010
default if we can magically figure that

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,470
out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow on all the edges are big</font>

433
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,780
core fabrics wouldn't be amplified and

434
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,320
attacked constantly by these hosts on

435
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:46,010
the other side of them the last part was

436
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:50,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> often times the fixed code isn't</font>

437
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:54,350
really fixed so I mean auto update for

438
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">your mac OS box when like oh crap my OS</font>

439
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,740

441
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,580
640 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we don't have those so</font>

442
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,010
that's why I'm 160 that's that's not

443
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">good sure there's a whole region that's</font>

444
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,000
a big big problem and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

445
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,219
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was making this sort of assumption</font>

446
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,050
right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not for ice bees not</font>

447
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,390
for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> axes yeah maybe it's maybe that's</font>

448
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:18,350
maybe that's a fair statement for the

449
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:20,030
home user cable modem dsl up to a

450
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,309
certain size enterprise customer maybe

451
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,870
that's an acceptable solution and I know

452
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,820
what the sizes but if we had the knobs

453
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,350
to control and we could at least propose

454
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,270
something that was sort of the standard

455
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,189
and you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all off of course</font>

456
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,639
but you know it's it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an idea</font>

457
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,720
it's an idea for for dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

458
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,610
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference between this and</font>

459
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,860
how to update<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we recently</font>

462
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I really haven't looked much into</font>

463
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:50,990
to how auto<font color="#CCCCCC"> SecureWorks and I I so I</font>

464
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,550
don't know the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't believe</font>

465
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,810
that that downloads code<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that</font>

466
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,000
that the

467
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,700
helps you close out known

468
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,460
vulnerabilities I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard Center</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto update auto secures features</font>

470
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm sure there's a cisco person or

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,030
somebody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to say so hold on a</font>

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,370
minute where we cannot no no no don't go

473
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,260
away we can take some questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

474
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,179
we've got a lot to talk about we were

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,980
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the questions at the end</font>

but if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be if we're</font>

477
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,600
not lining the microphones up but Steve

478
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,910
Wilcox and then I can take a question

479
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you you ask the questions before so</font>

480
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,270
I thought I'd give you some assuming

481
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're not going to use this for</font>

484
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,150
worth comparing remember the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the netgear</font>

485
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,840
thing where they had the ntp<font color="#E5E5E5"> dos built</font>

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:40,280
into the firm code firmware and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

487
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,350
the fix for it there was like a million

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">boxes deployed virtually none of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

489
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,550
got the none of them could be contacted

490
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,650
or updated because the boxes were just

491

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,150
are the most affected companies

540

there should be better reliability for

happens for a lot of reasons generally

00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,679
smaller companies don't have network

something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say there but i'm thinking</font>

598
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,050
i'll take not sure I'm clear on on how

599
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,760
network engineers are too expensive for

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so you know the average enterprise</font>

602

<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean if we're talking economics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

607
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,020
think yeah I wish I would have done some

608
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,000
more research for the actual average

609
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,340
numbers but i'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> somewhere along</font>

610
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,380
the lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the company that has</font>

611
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,050
small server farms and they provide

612
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,340
services to people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a router</font>

613
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,080
because they need to connect to the

614
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,399
internet and have switches because they

615
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,639
need to connect all their servers to

616
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,740
their their routers and i would think

617
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,980
that that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more average than</font>

618
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,660
it is you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

619
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,030
smaller number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large enterprises</font>

620
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,520
that that have good internal expertise

621
00:24:53,030 --> 00:25:01,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">so so mostly like SMBs small to medium</font>

622
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:03,860
businesses yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and i do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

623
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,330
believe we as an operator community

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,070
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do believe that we as an</font>

operator community<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequently come to</font>

626
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,879
the conclusion that educating people is

627
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,370
generally a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is needed to</font>

628
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,780
help secure up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet but i would</font>

629
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,929
also like to see our<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus changed</font>

630
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,280
somewhat into looking to looking at

631
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,140
automatically securing and changing the

632
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,149
defaults to make it harder to be

633
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,730
insecure so that that's generally what

634
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,320
this is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling no matter what</font>

635
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,710
the defaults are someone will find a way

636
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be insecure</font>

637
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:40,230
okay question 5 is directed to Richard

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:42,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">steenburgen on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> April twentieth 2004 a</font>

642

somewhat unfortunate feature got the

date right well that's a good point but

656
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,590
roll with this air I think we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

657

the point Joel did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">something good thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you okay go ahead</font>

going to say regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> this specific</font>

661
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:53,430
issue you know as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the answer</font>

should they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worker bound be</font>

663
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:59,400
be published really the answer is it

664
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:02,400
depends it depends on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy it is to</font>

reconstruct the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual attack it</font>

depends on what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack is how how</font>

667
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,500
easy it is to to exploit or in the case

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP vulnerability if it's even an</font>

669
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,550
issue at all most knowledgeable

engineers with regard to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP reset</font>

671
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,110
vulnerability already knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was how</font>

TCP work that was how it was meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

673
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,469
work there was nothing new there it

00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,139
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vulnerability it wasn't a</font>

675
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:32,460
serious issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the fact that the the</font>

676
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:35,700
information was was leaked so slowly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

677
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,130
with so much secrecy really caused a lot

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,710
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to run around deploying md5</font>

where they didn't need

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:46,080
resulted in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of pissed-off</font>

681
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:49,710
engineers later some other instances<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

682
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,290
know some some historical examples the

683
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,420
vendors have given out a little bit too

684
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,790
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> information there there been work</font>

685
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,200
arounds but they disclosed so much you

686
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,110
know here's what the filter and here's

687
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,090
exactly why it why it happens and they

688
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,310
provided so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail that it was</font>

689
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:09,409
immediately easy to reconstruct the

690
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:11,820
attack and within you know you would see

691
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,950
months that the code had been fixed had

692
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,129
been built into various releases and

693
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:19,080
then within 48 hours of the the notice

694
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,640
being put out<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so much</font>

695
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,949
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the work around that you</font>

696
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,200
were seeing exploits in the wild so

697
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,120
that's that's where you're going too far

698
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,100
on the other side so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the the</font>

699
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer is you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use some common</font>

700
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,100
sense we need to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information out</font>

701
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,520
there where it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's</font>

702
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,370
not going to be so completely obvious

703
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,960
that that you can reconstruct the attack

704
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:45,840
you know if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a workaround and</font>

705
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,520
it's it's reasonable enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

706
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,709
know you can you can tell your customers

707
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,270
that if you're not running mpls you're

708
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,000
not going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> affected by this bug</font>

709
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:58,950
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leaving them all confused and</font>

710
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,050
bewildered okay guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask it just a couple</font>

711
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,480
of questions for Richard so unless you

712
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,120
had something go right ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> to first</font>

713
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,440
often often times unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

714
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,350
some of the vulnerabilities the details

715
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,120
about the vulnerability are relevant to

716
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:16,500
the fix so the fix for<font color="#CCCCCC"> patricks network</font>

717
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,779

00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:05,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think at the time Patrick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually and</font>

738
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:07,428
he should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on this he</font>

739
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:14,749
was saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people requiring</font>

740
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:16,219
him to do md5 is that correct no no III

741
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:18,799
thought that you had actually set on the

742
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:21,700
mailing list that you had some of your

743
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,769
providers requiring you to do md5 oh

744
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,119
yeah at the time we we did have actually

745
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:27,259
upstream providers requiring us to do

746
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,408
md5 or they were going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down our</font>

747
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:32,509
our links and we didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any didn't</font>

748
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:34,369
have any information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on why didn't</font>

749
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:36,919
understand it and once we figured it out

750
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:39,080
we turned it off yeah we saw a little

751
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">overreaction to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and when I</font>

752
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,499
afterwards when I went to ask those

753
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:44,210
providers the answer was they didn't

754
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:45,710
know either that somebody at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tack</font>

755
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,089
told him and in fact in some cases that

756
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">old attack didn't know any better but</font>

757
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:50,960
they were doing it anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

758
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">people did the upgrade or the fix just</font>

759
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:58,999
because any hands or anybody willing to

760
00:30:54,589 --> 00:31:01,369
admit that so I mean maybe that that

761
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:03,039
specific specific example is good for a

762
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:06,499
number of reasons but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's also a</font>

763
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,940
bad example because people just reacted

764
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:10,489
I think like people with their hair on

765
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,649
fire for no<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular reason there's no</font>

766
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:14,110
one for me to have some to get it on

767
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:18,850
fire maybe that's

768
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:21,780
happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hair and also richard has</font>

stuff like you imply you're implying

773
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,309
that people really understand how TCP

774

works and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't think that's the</font>

795
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:33,820
everybody I we went enrolled md5 out

796
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:37,239
based upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we were told from a</font>

797
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,860
number of different vendors and agencies

798
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,720
we were told we needed to do it with old

799
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,639
was a vulnerability and this is a bad

800
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,040
example for this reason but it was

801
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometime afterwards quite a long time</font>

802
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,490
afterwards when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually found out</font>

803
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,929
the specifics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vulnerability and</font>

804
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,250
realized there wasn't the vulnerability

805
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:53,980
so it's unfair to say that people

806
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:56,679
reactive we were told<font color="#E5E5E5"> category</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two there</font>

807
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:00,360
was a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and we reacted to it</font>

808
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,360
as we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told to react</font>

809
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:10,850
Steve<font color="#E5E5E5"> Feldman this works oh I would like</font>

810
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:11,990
that coupler point out that from my

811
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,760
point of view which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

812
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,460
provider we were being told to do this

813
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,100
by people that we trusted to be right

814
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:21,320
and the feeling was we trust these

815
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,178
people if we don't do it we might be in

816
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,250
trouble so he better<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it it wasn't</font>

817
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:28,669
terribly difficult for us and I don't

818
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:32,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">regret doing it in hindsight yeah maybe</font>

819
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't needed in hindsight maybe I need</font>

820
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,590
to question the trust that I have for

821
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,090
some of those sources but I think I

822
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,340
reacted correctly based on the

823
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,840
information I was given and I suspect

824
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:46,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">most of the people around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here would</font>

825
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,689
agree with that so they really be it was

826
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,029
an issue then of who do you trust to

827
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,640
tell you to jump and deciding if we

828
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:54,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust them before you jump hey so so</font>

829
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,240
overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you didn't really care</font>

830
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,309
either way about the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

831
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,529
I mean and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the same</font>

832
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:02,539
problem that patrick has about

833
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:05,270
maintaining keys all over the place or

834
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:07,039
like we have maintaining keys for god

835
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:12,168
knows how many customers who want

836
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:14,418
password is there cake well I'm just

837
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:17,089
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

838
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:18,799
because if everyone knows what it is but

839
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:21,290
it's not a good example<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

840
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,580
really wasn't handled very well it

841
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,440
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> island maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a great</font>

842
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">example it wasn't handled very well but</font>

843
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,950
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking over the last the</font>

844
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,230
history of incidents that that I've been

845
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:32,540
involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're getting better</font>

846
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,639
this one maybe was a step backwards but

847
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,649
no they're getting better to some extent

848
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the SNMP issue that came out was</font>

849
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:42,759
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a complete nightmare so I</font>

850
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:44,779
guess there are several sentences but

851
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we're going to move on to question</font>

852
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,970
six questions sexist for<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris morrow</font>

853
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,649
there are multiple methods of

854
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,719
vulnerability announcements that impact

855
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:55,129
the operator community those include the

856
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,919
whisper network and basically the

857
00:34:55,129 --> 00:35:00,650
whisper network is you work it tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">isp in you call me and go i just heard</font>

859
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:06,260
about this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm letting you</font>

860
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:09,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">know about it nsp sec nanog and I</font>

861
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">knocked DBA and also vendor reporting</font>

862
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,339
methods like<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace are so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

863
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,580
is what is the most expedient path to

864
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:15,590
get

865
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,540
the information to isps to collaborative

866
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,240
collaboratively determined mitigations

867
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,980
in the absence of a patch we feel

868
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,680
compelled to share the mitigation of the

869
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,630
same outside of the US region and is the

870
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">network is the whisper network a good or</font>

871
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:34,160
bad thing so i will talk not ramble so

872
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:36,920
much my answer but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the collaboration</font>

873
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,020
issue at my feeling is that that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

874
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,430
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard everybody's networkers</font>

875
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,350
architected differently everybody made

876
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,950
design decisions during that that

877
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:48,020
impacts every vulnerabilities effect on

878
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">there but their level of risk from that</font>

879
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,730
vulnerability so i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

880
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,620
collaboratively meet calling up somebody

881
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,140
and saying I heard about blah you should

882
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,400
do this is helpful because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

883
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,900
what their network looks like so me

884
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,100
telling them that isn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

885
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,840
necessarily helpful it said maybe that's

886
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,750
a little bit difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

887
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,120
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have information about some</font>

888
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,740
particular vulnerability and you you

889
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,890
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to be careful who you</font>

890
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:17,930
share it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

891
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,879
the world you wish harm on other folks

892
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,350
or other networks that's difficult so if

893
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,480
you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and tell the vendor</font>

894
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:24,830
about it running around<font color="#CCCCCC"> and telling all</font>

895
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,840
your best friends and putting up a man

896
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:31,190
list maybe is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the best option and</font>

897
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">also in many cases that would be</font>

898
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:35,480
violating an NDA which is not such a

899
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:39,110
smart thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do right right that's</font>

900
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piling NDA's gets me in trouble so</font>

901
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:44,660
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first question</font>

902
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:46,870
sort of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> compelling compelled to</font>

903
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,040
share it outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the US region as a</font>

904
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,390
multinational<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporation I don't really</font>

905
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,730
have a whole lot of choice if some

906
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:55,220
vendor tells me about something I have

907
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:58,250
parts of my company that are in asia pac

908
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,319
and amia that I have to make aware of

909
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,300
the problem and make aware of the fix

910
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,490
that we plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> on implementing in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s.</font>

911
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,050
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> our operations group doesn't</font>

912
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,540
necessarily dictate operations

913
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,130
everywhere and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes by the</font>

914
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,670
operations group as well which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

915
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:15,860
fun so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of choice now</font>

916
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:18,800
did I tell the Indian government about

917
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:21,560
it no no don't tell my customers about

918
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,000
it either so I mean there have been

919
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,869
plenty of incidents where we prepared a

920
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,130
customer state

921
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,240
we prepared a statement to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

922
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:29,119
government because we knew they were

923
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,758
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask us about it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

924
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,559
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not our responsibility to</font>

925
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:35,210
tell the customer anything when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

926
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:37,009
we really just say hey you should go

927
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,960
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cisco about this here's a web</font>

928
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:41,749
page and we give them a little primer on

929
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,009
what the problem is and how do your

930
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:45,589
customers react when you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> men</font>

931
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:47,150
typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> most times they call in and</font>

932
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:48,170
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just confused they don't really</font>

933
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand this what I was think about</font>

934
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,700
the implied knowledge didn't necessarily

935
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:53,749
know so they you know they they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

936
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,149
understand what the problem is they're

937
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:57,828
just looking for a heads up and and what

938
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:01,190
did we do a lot of times like are you

939
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:03,529
fixing this yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so when when you</font>

940
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,390
get a large vulnerability that gets a

941
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:07,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of press does your call center or</font>

942
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:09,170
phones ringing off the hook and your

943
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,960
ticket queues load up<font color="#E5E5E5"> really heavily and</font>

944
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,400
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends on the</font>

945
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular incident but we definitely</font>

946
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,859
have had those where the call centers

947
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,690
got very very congested and so that it

948
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:23,420
caused us headache and so that's why we

949
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">prepared a statement and said hey here's</font>

950
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,839
what we can tell you know we prepare

951
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,970
something that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> email the</font>

952
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,200
customer something they can speak to the

953
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,689
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some talking points that</font>

954
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,549
have some more detail and then we say

955
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:39,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">and by the way the vendor documents for</font>

956
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:42,019
this are also very good so I'll say yes

957
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:43,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said my last point I</font>

958
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:45,680
didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I'm sorry go ahead</font>

959
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,309
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

960
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,828
um so the is is the whisper network it

961
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:55,220
is it good<font color="#E5E5E5"> or bad and I think it depends</font>

962
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:56,420
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how its run you know having a system</font>

963
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,368
that's like the telephone game is

964
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,569
difficult because I tell you you tell

965
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,529
somebody and by the time it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets back</font>

966
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:03,890
around to me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still a different</font>

967
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:07,910
story so it's very very challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

968
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,440
do any kind of secure quiet

969
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,950
communications on something that's it's

970
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,589
going to be very public do you think in

971
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:19,549
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of the tcp / and d5</font>

972
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:21,259
vulnerability md5 vulnerability that the

973
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:24,230
whisper network may have contributed to

974
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:26,809
the overreaction of most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font>

975
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,130
that overreacted yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that if</font>

976
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:29,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that incident that's</font>

977
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,279
why I kept saying to say maybe this

978
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,960
wasn't the best incident to use yeah and

979
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:34,850
that in say it before you prepared your

980
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,880
slides unfortunately

981
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:40,520
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you know if I hear</font>

982
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:44,120
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> as bad night tell Chris and he</font>

983
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,790
trusts<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and he doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask why is this</font>

984
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad explained to me the problem explain</font>

985
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,870
to me how this is bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me and then he</font>

986
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,279
makes an educated decision about and

987
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:55,009
again i'm just using Chris as an example

988
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,610
not to poke fingers at him but you know

989
00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:00,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad um if he doesn't</font>

990
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,430
fully understand it and he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

991
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,930
implement something and turns around and

992
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,930
tells his engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and operations</font>

993
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,399
group to go and implement something then

994
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:10,669
we end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation like the TCP</font>

995
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,960
md5 issue or that TCP issue I don't

996
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what happened</font>

997
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,440
because I know everyone I talked to and

998
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,480
I know what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did when I was told which</font>

999
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,980
was why should we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this what's wrong</font>

1000
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,580
can you tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me more and the answer was</font>

1001
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:25,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">no go do this and since people like your</font>

1002
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,210
vendors you know Tony telling me well if

1003
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,280
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't trust your vendors you know</font>

1004
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,980
how we write<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code you have to trust</font>

1005
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,390
us or people like our transfer providers

1006
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,280
telling us well you need to do this

1007
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've done this on our network I mean</font>

1008
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,490
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to trust and what's</font>

1009
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,290
going to happen next time there really

1010
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:41,390
is a vulnerability and this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

1011
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:43,040
information you have i I really don't

1012
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,660
think it's because people just went oh

1013
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,190
wow I heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this you know somebody</font>

1014
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned it over dinner one day and i</font>

1015
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,030
think i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change my entire</font>

1016
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,740
network because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yes I made an</font>

1017
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,360
overly simplified example but you did

1018
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,839
say in what you said in your statement

1019
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,130
earlier that that your provider told you

1020
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,470
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we're going to shut your link</font>

1021
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,330
down your session down and you ask why

1022
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,279
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know why and then</font>

1023
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,840
later on you ask the next person<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

1024
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,430
lion they said we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never really did find</font>

1025
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,350
out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was up with that that's right</font>

1026
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,970
so mean these are all doing it and they

1027
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,290
all told me to do it what rights are you

1028
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,970
going to do but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I'm</font>

1029
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying is it you know if you if you</font>

1030
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:18,799
can't make an educated decision about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1031
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,000
then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's also part of the poems</font>

1032
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can have the information the last</font>

1033
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,300
little point about that is that

1034
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:26,810
oftentimes the folks that get involved

1035
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,430
with that are non helpful so when my

1036
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,840
execs hear about it I have to have like

1037
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,009
twice daily calls with people about

1038
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,080
stuff so I don't get anything done

1039
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,280
except preparing for calls you know but

1040
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,170
the government people hear about it they

1041
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">want twice daily calls about this</font>

1042
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident and again no work gets done</font>

1043
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,240
same with PR so there's a there's a

1044
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,160
point when all those people do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1045
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,410
get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but early on is not the</font>

1046
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,029
time and during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual fix is not</font>

1047
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:51,839
the time

1048
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:55,450
as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks Joel</font>

1049
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:59,400
when your vendors and people in your

1050
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:03,399
government come to you and say install

1051
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP md5 or else that's not disclosure</font>

1052
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,840
right and so of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to</font>

1053
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,720
hit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> window with the whisper network</font>

1054
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,060
right people are going to expose that

1055
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,470
and yes they're going to overreact react

1056
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,970
because they have no way to make

1057
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:20,410
intelligent decisions about deploying

1058
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,569
functionality in their network so it

1059
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:24,040
shouldn't come as a shock to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone that</font>

1060
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,650
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information would leak out</font>

1061
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,690
or that without disclosure disclosure as

1062
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:34,420
to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually going on that</font>

1063
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:38,140
people might overreact I think it goes

1064
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:40,570
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide to that I spoke to that we</font>

1065
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,910
I hear it from Chris who tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about</font>

1066
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:45,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he tells me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

1067
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:47,649
md5 on all my sessions and since my

1068
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:50,740
vendor flat out refuses to tell me

1069
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:52,930
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on I take what is the next</font>

1070
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,959
best hope that I have to protect my

1071
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,210
network if the exploit comes out into

1072
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,890
the wild without<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendor disclosing</font>

1073
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:03,430
at us before it comes out into the wild

1074
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,930
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I take my friend here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris who</font>

1075
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:07,419
called me up and said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font>

1076
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">this I'll take his word over the vendor</font>

1077
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,510
who won't I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a word from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1078
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,850
vendor because they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me</font>

1079
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that a lot of a lot</font>

1080
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:19,710
of the especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case the TCP</font>

1081
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:22,600
md5 stuff came came from vendors

1082
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:25,750
following their<font color="#CCCCCC"> their clothes practices</font>

1083
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,270
and and the web of trust of sorts of

1084
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:32,170
operators responding responding within

1085
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:35,200
that we also have a minor well not so

1086
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:37,420
minor issue with with lack of a single

1087
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,879
definitive source of information there's

1088
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,250
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different communities all</font>

1089
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,660
over the globe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all have to deal</font>

1090
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,130
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of issues and figuring</font>

1091
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,129
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to disseminate the information</font>

1092
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,119
and you know we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it should</font>

1093
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,749
go to that

1094
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,900
gorai not DBA or come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sir or MSP</font>

1095
00:43:52,749 --> 00:43:57,910
sec or Homeland Security or what this is

1096
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,249
this big question so all these sources

1097
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,019
of information we all keep up with sort

1098
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:03,848
of when we can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> through our mailing</font>

1099
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:05,229
lists and everything else and come to

1100
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:08,859
our own conclusions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we think</font>

1101
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:10,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">is is appropriate to responsive and we</font>

1102
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:12,430
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with some way that says</font>

1103
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:14,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is really important to everybody</font>

1104
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,720
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really important to people</font>

1105
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,460
running mpls this is really important to

1106
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,328
people still running here grp or

1107
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:24,309
something like that and and and and

1108
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:25,480
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having this big noisy list</font>

1109
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:32,980
have something that's rather selective

1110
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:34,809
and directed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you we're going</font>

1111
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">to next we're going to bring up Jerry</font>

address<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question for us Jerry you here</font>

1115
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:47,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok yeah you can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from that</font>

1116
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:49,269
microphone the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Jerry Dixon</font>

1117
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:51,460
is what role should the Department of

1118
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:53,910
Homeland Security us-cert have resolving

1119
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,989
issues surrounding vulnerability release

1120
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,700
Jerry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I had a discussion a little</font>

1121
00:44:55,989 --> 00:44:59,460
bit earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I told them to feel free</font>

1122
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,649
to kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> vert off a little bit and</font>

1123
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,869
shape this to a little to something a

1124
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,130
little bit more general so guy Jerry I

1125
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:09,099
think there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a lot of good</font>

1126
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion on you know how to</font>

1127
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:12,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate vulnerabilities you know one</font>

1128
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:13,839
of the just add on to you know what

1129
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:16,960
you're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know who do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1130
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,099
go to and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you you know</font>

1131
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,839
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a question I guess it's a</font>

1132
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:21,489
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit higher level how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind</font>

1133
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,960
of triage that vulnerability how do you

1134
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:24,940
know you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the severity of it</font>

1135
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,440
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how do you know how many of you</font>

1136
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,839
all have like a vulnerability scoring

1137
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,519
system you know within your organization

1138
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:36,630
whether you're an operator or a vendor

1139
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:38,859
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to show of hands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok bit</font>

1140
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:40,059
heavier I'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody heard</font>

1141
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:42,489
that because I'm having<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble hearing</font>

1142
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:44,670
you so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do that again how</font>

1143
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">many of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a mechanism in place to</font>

1144
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,509
you know score of vulnerability or

1145
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:51,299
assess the criticality of it from a you

1146
00:45:49,509 --> 00:45:58,989
know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're an operator or a</font>

1147
00:45:51,299 --> 00:46:01,119
vendor just by a show of hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok one of</font>

1148
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,650
the challenges and I think you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1149
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,420
a us-cert perspective

00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,330
in a situational awareness and these

1151
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,700
kind of things are kind of key based on

1152
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:12,490
you know we deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of national</font>

1153
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:14,020
loved ones and response teams with

1154
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:15,189
foreign governments we've got

1155
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:19,180
partnerships in place with those

1156
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:20,500
organizations and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times more</font>

1157
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,980
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> than not they'll come across</font>

1158
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,090
exploit code or they might have a you

1159
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,190
know find a vulnerability being

1160
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:28,420
exploited but don't yet have the code

1161
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:31,690
but they're at least communicating that

1162
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:33,700
information and if we've got somebody

1163
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know on the US side whether it's an</font>

1164
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,980
operator or a group that we can kind of

1165
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,540
say hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on you</font>

1166
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,610
know we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ratchet up the the</font>

1167
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,890
criticality of it to determine you know

1168
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:46,690
what makes sense on communicating it you

1169
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:51,400
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use an example it comes up quite</font>

1170
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:54,460
often as we were you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHS was</font>

1171
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,900
talking with the DNS community and in

1172
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,010
trying to determine you know what should

1173
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:01,900
get reported to you know say<font color="#CCCCCC"> US sir and</font>

1174
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,830
you know one of the folks there you know

1175
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,470
said well you know would be interested

1176
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:07,029

level event to determine you know what

00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,380
should get communicated how does it get

1183
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,450
communicated as well as take into

1184
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,150
account for when is the vendor going to

1185
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:26,549
have a patch available for folks and one

1186
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things that we're interested in</font>

1187
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:31,000
working especially with the you know the

1192
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,010
but there's a lot of malicious activity

taking place what are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steps</font>

to mitigate it how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get that</font>

here over the next couple of days

there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us you know if you</font>

here in the

1212
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,370
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to point out</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">too is how many of you know exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

us-cert does outside of the

00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:30,610
vulnerability context okay well

1216
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:34,510
basically just to give you a quick

rundown we're responsible for incident

coordination across the federal

<font color="#CCCCCC">government so something's happening</font>

1220
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:42,220
within a particular agency say within

they identify you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1223
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,470
malware that's not currently being

1224
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:49,150

intrusion set within their environment

1226
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:53,380
that gets reported up we help bringing

1227
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,470
additional resources or help with

1228
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,060
analysis if they request it but it gives

00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,250
us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> general picture what's taking place</font>

they have a major intrusion set

providing on-site response if needed

1279
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:07,288
about botnets on either a you know a

00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:10,650
being able to reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the highest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fees</font>

1282
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,000
to let them<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been very responsive</font>

1283
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,740
and enforcing their acceptable use

1284
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,349
policy would like to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend</font>

1285
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue on because it helps one you</font>

1286
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:19,020
know reduce the amount of systems out

1287
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,779
there that are causing everybody

1288
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,670
problems so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jerry when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually you</font>

1289
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:25,740
call an ISP and ask them to enforce

1290
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,440
their IEP do they typically cooperate or

1291
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">when what's your typical response</font>

1292
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically we typically will reach out if</font>

1293
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,420
we don't have our own direct contact you

1294
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,579
know you kind of touch on the whisper

1295
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,079
network you know we use that vehicle you

1296
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,020
know based on folks that we know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1297
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,020
also reach out to abuse departments in

1298
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last couple of months we've been</font>

1299
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:46,980
passing information to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet service</font>

1300
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:49,799
providers and they you know have gotten

00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to us rather quickly and have you</font>

1302
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:53,670
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically they tell us of their</font>

1303
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:56,150
voice in force in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the acceptable use</font>

1304
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:58,319
policy however you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if there's a</font>

1305
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,390
trick for us is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have embedded</font>

1306
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">law enforcement is to make sure that</font>

1307
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,900
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> also trampling on something</font>

1308
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:05,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working if they are</font>

1309
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">working something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then there'll be the</font>

1310
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:10,319
conduit to reaching out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

1312
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically the subpoena process or the</font>

1313
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:17,970
other mechanisms that they have to to

1314
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:19,589
enforce getting that system either set

1315
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:23,939
aside for evidence or for monitoring

1316
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:26,839
purposes so you know in general I mean

1317
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,460
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had very few providers that have</font>

1318
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:30,839
you know not pushed back you know I can

1319
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,039
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of maybe every once in a</font>

1320
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,349
great while we'll have somebody pushed

1321
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:36,000
back and again depending on the severity

1322
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:39,420
of you know the issue that we're trying

1323
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tackle that will either go to the law</font>

1324
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:45,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">enforcement channel or we'll figure out</font>

1325
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:45,470
another way to tackle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that problem</font>

1326
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:53,098
so you know basically you know in

1327
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:55,800
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of covers you know just</font>

1328
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">some high-level topics that you know</font>

1329
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,740
we're interested in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also you know</font>

1330
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,990
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to</font>

1331
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:02,580
focus on is a general situation

1332
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,830
awareness you know we're interested in

1333
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,119
general trends trying to determine again

1334
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,799
you know what are the right thresholds

1335
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:11,339
what makes sense of what the US

1336
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">government should be aware of from a you</font>

1337
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:14,430
know a cyber attack or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> event that</font>

1338
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">might be taking place within your world</font>

1339
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:23,180
that's impacting your customers or<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1340
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:25,290
organization thanks Jerry for the next

professor Matthews and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way good</font>

1350
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:02,010
evening professor Matthews in a global

1351
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,629
network operator community one has

1352
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:06,240
certain local responsibilities

1353
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,859
specifically in certain communal

1354
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,729
responsibilities at the global level

1355
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:13,529
both of which are essential parts of

1356
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:16,710
responsible responsible practitioners

1357
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:18,810
manual in an operational context what

1358
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,300
are the distinct boundaries major themes

1359
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:24,349
for each area as we understand and

1360
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,349
accept universally

1361
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:43,959
nice boundaries so uh did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop the</font>

1362
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:51,759
call that figures on<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knees stayed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:11,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">well yes seems to be losing you in and</font>

1368
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:16,239
out boy first I'd like to a certain

1369
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:18,459
flavor what I intend to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font>

1374
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:34,170
strictly my own now we may proceed I

1375
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:37,150
guess I cannot speak specifically about

1376
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:39,849
any ongoing government program or those

1377
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:41,829
in the pipeline therefore if there are

1378
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:43,869
questions from anyone regarding specific

1379
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:46,930
issues in that vein it's probably best

1380
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:50,349
directed to someone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin</font>

1383
00:55:54,519 --> 00:56:01,508

00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:13,359
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national domain which respect to</font>

1389
00:56:10,569 --> 00:56:16,719
information systems and of course as

1390
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:21,578
Jerry Dixon just mentioned these systems

1391
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:25,239
encompass various layers I sort of

1392
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:28,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">divide it in in the context</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of civilian</font>

1393
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:31,420
and military civilian to include banking

00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:33,190
and finance transportation electrical

1395
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:37,150
power telecommunications or gas medical

1396
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:38,259
services cetera and the military systems

1397
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:40,989
to include command control

1398
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:45,369
communications and systems those systems

1399
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:46,330
that provide battlespace awareness for

1400
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:48,610
command and control

1401
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,540
this is combat identification

1402
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:53,140
intelligence surveillance and

1403
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:56,470
reconnaissance systems and again with

1404
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:58,200
respect to those moving concerns within

1405
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:00,430
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> session I think</font>

1406
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:05,799
consequences from failure in the

<font color="#CCCCCC">National domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involve very very large</font>

1408
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,130
consequences obviously the compromise of

1409
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:11,560
national security command structure

1410
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:13,840

loss of life compromise national

security and loss of public confidence

1414
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:27,000
of course sick I mean we have now large

1415
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:30,670
industrial concerns associated with

1416
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:35,410
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects of information system</font>

1417
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:38,710

network owner network manager and these

1567
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:19,919
these these domains of specialities we

1568
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:22,709
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> common lexa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cala tea and we</font>

1569
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,979
ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have standard terminology on</font>

1570
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:28,259
how we go about understanding defining

1571
01:05:25,979 --> 01:05:32,069
qualifying quantifying and and and

1572
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:35,130
enforcing security paradigms we did we

1573
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:37,590
simply we<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply have a great deal of</font>

1574
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:40,350
inconsistency in this regard

1575
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:41,730
so that is those are the pieces of

1576
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:44,430
information that I wish to<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrest with</font>

1577
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:47,670
and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> take questions and perhaps</font>

1578
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:49,379
engaging some dialogue Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:57,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">professor Matthews does anybody have any</font>

1580
01:05:49,380 --> 01:06:00,530

1582
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:05,630
ok so we're running a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

1583
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:07,400
here and I'm looking at Steve and Susan

yes

01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:04,900
companies make intelligent decisions

1598
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:04,900
about management of their infrastructure

mop mop<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact I think that we quite a</font>

1600
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:24,640
battle I think we answered a part of

1601
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:27,020
that in at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end in terms of we</font>

1602
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,390
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the whispernet that we</font>

1603
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:31,670
hear a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information and I think</font>

1604
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:34,250
that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of us base a lot of trust on</font>

1605
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:36,590
people who get the information before us

1606
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:39,170
and pass that information along so I

1607
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:42,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we're making assumptions that thus</font>

1608
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:43,670
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> have panned out all right that the</font>

Matthews hello hello hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we hello</font>

1612
01:07:55,190 --> 01:08:03,100
are we still hooked up hello not anymore

1613
01:08:03,439 --> 01:08:06,928
only because I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going</font>

1614
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:11,098
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'd wanted to keep saying hello</font>

1615
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:14,759
hello over and over ok the next question

1616
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:16,589
is from jay patel how do you determine

1617
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:18,479
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers should receive a really</font>

1618
01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:21,839
notice critical router vulnerabilities

1619
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:27,928
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the recent juniper ldp /</font>

1620
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:29,759
mpls related explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think this comes</font>

1621
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:32,730
back to what we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

1622
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:34,439
earlier in terms of how do you actually

1623
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:37,500
get these things out there and avoid the

1624
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:40,169
whisper network yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1625
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,339
there's a easy or rights of answer to

1626
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:42,809
that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have enough</font>

1627
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:47,189
time to discuss that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one here yeah</font>

1628
01:08:42,809 --> 01:08:49,880
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> there certainly the belief from</font>

1629
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:53,578
from some folks that there's some

1630
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:55,549
networks or some customers that like the

1631
01:08:53,578 --> 01:08:57,689
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance will want</font>

1632
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:59,429
answers about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vulnerability as early</font>

1633
01:08:57,689 --> 01:09:00,928
as possible because they like asking

1634
01:08:59,429 --> 01:09:02,429
those questions I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they ever</font>

1635
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:04,019
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it useful with it but they</font>

1636
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:07,078
they sure to act like to ask the

1637
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:11,489
question for operators though there's

1638
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:13,828
some folks that other networks will

1639
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:16,948
depend upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to get the fix so</font>

1640
01:09:13,828 --> 01:09:19,318
if you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go across tds telecom to</font>

1641
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:24,439
get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juniper you probably want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

1642
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:27,500
sure the t-test telecom is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I mean</font>

1643
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:30,238
you might also look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martin and say I</font>

1644
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:34,019
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dns server work so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can look up</font>

1645
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:35,899
or you have your etsy host primed right

1646
01:09:34,019 --> 01:09:38,130
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's no</font>

1647
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:39,868
unfortunately it is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated</font>

1648
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:42,080
answer and I'm certainly not qualified

1649
01:09:39,868 --> 01:09:45,099
answers but not completely

1650
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,960
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll stay with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me too</font>

1651
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:49,940
Martin I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I lost you for</font>

1652
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,850
another time back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok professor</font>

1653
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:55,700
Matthews did you have a question as well

1654
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:57,020
no I if I've failed to answer anyone's

1655
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,700
question I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to let you know</font>

1656
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:01,070
that I departed from you for a short bit

1657
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:06,620
there a line got dropped and added out

1658
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:08,630
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we've actually gone to the</font>

1659
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,730
point where we're taking the last

1660
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:14,270
question that we've received and it's

1661
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:18,469
directed at one of the panel members how

1662
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:19,700
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I'm sorry go ahead i</font>

1663
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:22,100
play it's not a question that's just a

1664
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:27,910
recommendation speak up please for the

1665
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:31,820
next panel you have I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear the</font>

1666
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:34,309
devil's advocate<font color="#CCCCCC"> position for example on</font>

1667
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:36,400
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> one I know we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to</font>

1668
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:38,380
discuss that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now but I know it's a</font>

1669
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:41,420
controversial

1670
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:44,120
just a stretch up this

1671
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:46,190
so you're suggesting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we what take</font>

1672
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:49,400
somebody who has different views I don't

1673
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:51,169
understand yeah and there is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1674
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,239
obviously several people who think that

1675
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:56,650
full disclosure immediately should be

1676
01:10:53,239 --> 01:11:00,468
done that's why the audience is here and

1677
01:10:56,650 --> 01:11:04,309
you you are who from where Tristan horn

1678
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:07,280
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> collabnet thank you ok this is the</font>

1679
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:09,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question that we can take and it's</font>

1680
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,929
from Jay<font color="#CCCCCC"> again how do you make sure the</font>

1681
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,420
providers which represent a significant

1682
01:11:11,929 --> 01:11:18,140
amount of traffic and customer base but

1683
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:20,630
which are not on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> radar because</font>

1684
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:22,969
they're not tier ones and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe he's</font>

1685
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:24,679
referring to skitter or purchase

1686
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:26,150
refurbished network hardware and

1687
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:29,030
therefore do not maintain support

1688
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:32,120
contracts or are otherwise trying to

1689
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:33,949
remain solvent are informed in a timely

1690
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:36,530
fashion so that they have an opportunity

1691
01:11:33,949 --> 01:11:38,960
to upgrade their networks before it's

1692
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:40,580
too late<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

1693
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,770
answer for that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes</font>

1694
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:45,800
towards the first question although i

1695
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:47,929
think discussing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> skidder gator and</font>

1696
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:50,330
its use<font color="#CCCCCC"> is applied to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is useful but</font>

1697
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:51,949
again another topic that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font>

1698
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,300
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a lot more detail that we</font>

1699
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:54,860
can go into right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there was</font>

1700
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,330
just one quick comment as an important

1701
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,280
point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> its question those who don't</font>

1702
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:59,750
have support contracts right if you

1703
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,610
don't have a support contract the vendor

1704
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:04,730
really has no obligation to tell you

1705
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:06,620
anything and I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that</font>

looking for the vendor to tell you

1712
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:20,600
couple of vendors who do public releases

1713
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:23,020
of information and fixes and provide the

1714

that a hardware and network hardware

1720
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,800
vendors should give a release of kodell

1721
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:42,490
to solve a major problem regardless of

1722
