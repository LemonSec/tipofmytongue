00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
hi I'm Todd and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:09,928
about what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Christmas Eve</font>

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,910
last year many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you remember this it</font>

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,469
wasn't good and it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty and it</font>

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,570
didn't last for too long but it was

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,279
pretty sucky at the time it happened so

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,800
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna do is go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through some</font>

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,680
sort of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,689
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timelines look at how far</font>

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,340
the damage spread and who spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,310
damage and who was hurt most by the

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,900
damage and hopefully this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you</font>

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,690
know for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you many people I've</font>

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,040
talked to have said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,870
deal we didn't really carry that many

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,280
bad prefixes for very long and the

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,870
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> is those people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,300
their networks very well or they

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,030
consider an hour of 60,000 prefixes that

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,860
are wrong just not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal so we're</font>

21
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to look through those and look at</font>

22
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,449
the data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then after the sufficiently</font>

23
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,370
grim picture of doom and gloom is

24
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,769
painted then maybe I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with</font>

25
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">some suggestions of what we might want</font>

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do about those things questions are</font>

27
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,250
encouraged so what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24th of</font>

28
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,560
December last year over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,939
thousand routes were advertised by

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,240
teaching at a s 9121 to all of their

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,548
peers and they propagated globally you

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,240
know thousands and thousands tens of

33
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,520
thousands of of networks were propagated

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,939
on all the big a esas everyone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs</font>

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,220
a significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet ass in this room</font>

36
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:31,110
had lots of bad prefixes ranging from a

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,640
few thousand to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty or eighty thousand</font>

38
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,670
two hundred and seven thousand for the

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,340
unfortunate folks at telecom italia and

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,960
they stuck around for a long time for

41
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,850
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour and then they went away</font>

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,360
and then they came back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

43
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,309
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> away again and max prof didn't</font>

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,890
really help anyone that much and I think

45
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,540
that's the many people read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the title</font>

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,600
inside oh you know somebody's going to

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,130
present max pref considered harmful you

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,199
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

49
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,670
that max<font color="#CCCCCC"> pref as currently implemented</font>

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,290
as harmful it's just that it doesn't

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,990
help nearly as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as people think it</font>

52
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,420
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact it looks like for people who</font>

53
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,798
have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a couple bgp sessions it</font>

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,959
doesn't help<font color="#E5E5E5"> much at all and we're going</font>

55
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to show why so we're going to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

56
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,319
the timeline look at the damage and look

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,589
at whether there are any steps

58

<font color="#E5E5E5">I can affect that so full table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

63
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,409
that telecom italia ended up with almost

<font color="#E5E5E5">a hundred and seven thousand bad</font>

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,650
single misconfigured session they had

67
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,019
one session with this customer that did

not have max breath the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

69
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,540
emphasizing that is in part because I

70
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you know modulo perfection people</font>

73
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,980
to realize is that everyone in this room

is transitively<font color="#CCCCCC"> cussed trusting every</font>

it's not a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good world to be in and</font>

88
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,439
we'll look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> why so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Telecom Italia has</font>

89
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,239
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pretty good peering god bless</font>

90
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,280
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so they they propagate these</font>

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,959
sessions to as many people as these bad

92

prefixes to as many people as they can

93
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,449
as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and you know as</font>

94
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously these look like good paths in</font>

95
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,139
many many cases these look like much

96
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,459
better paths than the paths they were

97
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,889
replacing you know because you've got

98
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,540
this very big<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-connected European a</font>

99
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,489
saying it now has an extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font>

100
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,259
path to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be used to</font>

101
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,120
have a much longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> path so these paths</font>

102
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:45,089
got selected different<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks selected</font>

103
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,620
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths it's tough when you have</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and seven thousand things to</font>

105
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,280
choose from so basically you guys can

106
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,019
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anything of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interest on the</font>

107
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,849
internet was somewhat significantly

108
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,919
harmed by this event here are a few so

109
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,469
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the exact timeline because</font>

110
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know looking at how it</font>

112
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,199
nine<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1957 UTC on the twenty-fourth of</font>

116
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,529
thousand nine hundred or so prefixes

117
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:21,779
within one second we're hearing reports

118
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,510
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirteen peers that they're picking</font>

119
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,340
up these prefixes so so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> good bgp</font>

120
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,810
is working exactly as expected and

121
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,919
router

122
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:32,930
propagating quickly thank goodness

123
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,419
within 10 seconds a third of our peer

124
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,930
set has heard and believed and put into

125
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:40,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">their routing announcements bad prefixes</font>

126
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,650
20 seconds later so within 30 seconds of

127
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first bad announcement we've got the</font>

majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our peers hearing and</font>

129
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,809
believing bad prefixes is not good the

130
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,270
peak announcement rate continues

131
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,610
unabated and it peaks at nine thirty six

132
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,919
ten so we're talking you know a full 40

133
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,080
minutes after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning of the event</font>

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:04,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first event ends pretty sharply</font>

135
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,750
at 1003 in terms of when talking to

136
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,969
people one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first questions if</font>

137
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,979
anybody is curious what caused this

138
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,620
event the TT net people just won't say

139
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:14,659
it looks I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what it</font>

140
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">could be other than you know an i GV</font>

141
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,840
redistribution because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

where you get you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,919
where you get a full table of random

144
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,960
stuff that you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an ebgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or hear</font>

145
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,330
otherwise but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be something else</font>

146
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't know it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

147
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,650
malicious because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't they certainly</font>

148
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,030
were hurt by it more than anyone else it

149
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,780
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of simple mistake</font>

150
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,489
but they just won't say there's a second

151
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,229
event and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the presentation</font>

152
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,360
for people who actually care about this

153
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,700
event we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't focus very much on the</font>

second event<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the presentation on the</font>

155
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,450
web there are a number of additional

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides that show the same level of</font>

detail about the second event<font color="#E5E5E5"> as about</font>

158
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,360
this one so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're curious we did all</font>

159
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,310
the same data analysis it's a smaller

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,050
event it happens much later in the day

161
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,770
it happens in the afternoon or in the

162
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,960
evening UTC it it's a short spiked and

163
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

164
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,710
sure what that was if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a sort of</font>

165
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,260
we think we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fixed no we don't</font>

166
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,380
yes we do sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> event it's tough to</font>

167
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,510
tell so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage was extremely</font>

168
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,310
widespread we can pick pretty much in

169
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,830
EAS in here and do this analysis we

170
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,150
picked T Leah just because Peters cranky

171
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,099
and so we thought we'd make fun of them

172
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">in public no there's some other reason</font>

173
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:30,350
no Helia the reason we picked is this is

174
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,909
a perfect example of why setting tight

175
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,130
max prefixes with the current

176
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:37,720
implementation doesn't help you that

177
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,300
much so T leah is a provider to 9121 and

178
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,810
they had

179
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,569
they had a max<font color="#CCCCCC"> prep set it wasn't that</font>

180
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">tight but it wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that loose so from</font>

181
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:51,120
9121<font color="#E5E5E5"> tilia ends up with a thousand eight</font>

182
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,190
hundred and forty-nine bad prefixes well

183
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,530
that's certainly a bad thing but that's

184
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,710
not that big a<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal it's not awful but</font>

185
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,960
it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> t</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leah carries almost</font>

186
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,789
11,000 bad prefixes unique bad prefixes

187

189
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,729
fact that everyone else heard different

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,739
prefixes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> t lee appears with a lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people and they heard different numbers</font>

192
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,190
of bad prefixes that are different

193
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,979
unique prefixes from different other

194
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,240
peers and this is that this slide is

195
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,190
kind of you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of boring and</font>

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,479
texting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff but this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

197
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,000
most important points of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

198
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,568
presentation is that if you peer if you

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,520
have more than one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp sessions</font>

200
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:32,460
even if you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> tight max prefix limits</font>

201
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,258
you will end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots and lots and</font>

202
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,758
lots of crappy routes when anyone

203
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,430
anywhere on the internet does things

204
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,310
like this because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage that you</font>

205
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,460
were exposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the sum of free</font>

206
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,469
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> max prefixes in your peering</font>

207
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,750
set so if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred sessions</font>

208
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:51,150
and they have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> average of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a thousand</font>

209
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,099
spare prefixes on each session a hundred

210
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,770
thousand prefixes is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage that you</font>

211
00:07:53,099 --> 00:08:00,599
can potentially take from an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

212
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:02,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">this so just a word on the data so that</font>

213
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,680
people know we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> collection</font>

214
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,319
infrastructure with about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 peering</font>

215
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,360
sessions all over the world and we do it

216
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,430
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Noda and links right now in multi-hop</font>

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">from elsewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a pretty good set</font>

218
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,169
of this is this is relatively

219
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:17,490
representative we think we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> full</font>

220
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:19,289
tables from all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers and we</font>

221
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,210
integrate all that data<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a single</font>

222
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,039
view so we're able to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of look at</font>

223
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,719
you know not just what happens in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Europe</font>

224
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,310
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens in the US or Australia</font>

225
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,289
but sort of all of it together so the

226
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">damage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're seeing is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

227
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,669
you know three peering sessions with

228
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,468
five tier ones or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something it's a</font>

229
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,939
hundred sessions from 100 very very

230
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,979
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people some of them</font>

231
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,459
operate huge networks some of them are

232
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,229
tiny regional ISPs in different areas so

233
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:46,380
when we when we see something that

234
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:49,850
crosses across all of our pure set it's

235
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:53,010
typically a pretty significant event<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

236
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,330
so this this slide is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest</font>

237
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,880
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show two slides that</font>

238
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,850
graphically represent the propagation of

239
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,880
bad prefixes um this slide shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique</font>

240
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,530
bad prefixes carried by a s if you're

241
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,080
following along at home it's probably

242
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier to see than the slides but</font>

243
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,160
essentially the color is represents a

244
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,160
tier of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many bad prefixes you ended</font>

245
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,370
up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see 9121 at the top and</font>

246
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,380
telecom italia right below that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

247
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,850
spread those pad prefixes to you know

248
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,820
all the big networks you would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

249
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,470
um we did not include every<font color="#CCCCCC"> network on</font>

250
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,480
the internet and here we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked you</font>

251
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,400
know large networks that we thought some

252
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">people would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in and looked</font>

253
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,900
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect on those networks we could</font>

254
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for any other networks</font>

255
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,160
but you know there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

256
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:41,819
things you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know for</font>

257
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,829
example a 69 39 hurricane electric over

258
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,200
there on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left they're taking bad</font>

259
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,790
prefixes from Telecom Italia but they're

260
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,740
also getting them from several other

261
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,599
places<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well they're getting some from</font>

262
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,560
Tel aglow band they're getting some from

263
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,450
you know 3292 and so even people flag

264
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,790
telecom who ended up with a bunch of bad

265
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,040
prefixes got the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them from a</font>

266
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,260
lot of little sessions and then a couple

267
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,870
of them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big chunk</font>

268
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,819
from 3292 so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture is really</font>

269
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting in some ways looking at an</font>

270
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,840
event<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this helps you track where</font>

271
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,180
people get their transit from and where

272
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,040
they here good<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefixes from it also</font>

273
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows the flow of damage so this</font>

274
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,270
particular chart is unique bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix is</font>

275
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:28,710
the next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is bad paths so if someone</font>

276
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:32,010
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> example here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a 701 so if we go</font>

277
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a 701 only takes only I mean</font>

278
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big ass but they only take</font>

279
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,730
16,600 bad prefixes but they end up with

280
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,070
a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forty nine thousand bad</font>

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,110
paths through them that's because the

282
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,300
damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is caused by a single bad</font>

283
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,820
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very well connected a</font>

284
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,500
s is much larger than the damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

285
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,510
caused by a single bad prefix at a

286
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,830
smaller ass simply by virtue of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

287
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,750
that they have better peering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

288
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,820
renounce it to more people and those

289
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,340
paths are then selected by those people

290
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,340
so so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of paths</font>

291
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,930
through an AS that we're bad just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

292
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,940
clarify we're counting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bad it's a</font>

293
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,520
very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind</font>

294
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,260
definition of bad if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> was prior</font>

295
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this event announced by someone other</font>

296
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,180
than 9121 and during this event

297
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,949
announced by 9121 we call it bad we're

298
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,199
assuming that during the outage they

299
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,780
didn't suddenly add new prefixes for

300
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,530
customers that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a fair</font>

301
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,420
assumption so let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the rate of</font>

302
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,970
the rate of bad prefixes showing up over

303
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,829
time this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peak you can see the peak</font>

304
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,600
rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> things were coming in at about</font>

305
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:37,970
sixty thousand bad prefixes in in a 30

306
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,360
second bucket the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> event was much</font>

307
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,190
much smaller we can zoom<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on that or</font>

308
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,390
look at it in log scale which helps see

309
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,730
a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of detail about the event</font>

310
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,980
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> zoom in on a tighter time series</font>

311
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,260
on the first event and just look at the

312
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,710
bulk of the event which really was from

313
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,210
919 to ten o'clock there's tapering over

314
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,890
that and actually interesting you know

315
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,960
interestingly seven and eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

316
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,880
after this event or six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

317
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,650
this event we're still seeing some of

318
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">these bad prefixes in some people's</font>

319
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,579
tables so that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit concerning</font>

320
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,920
the second event<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts sharply and</font>

321
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,980
falls sharply so still not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what</font>

322
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this is a this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

323
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,420
meat of what a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

324
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,430
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this is the rate of</font>

325
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,620
advertisements by a s so it's grouped

326
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,300
into four groups there's not anything

327
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,160
particular that groups these groups we

328
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,740
tried to group a<font color="#CCCCCC"> esas with similar rates</font>

329
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,660
of acquisition of bad prefixes together

330
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,910
but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just too many a SS that</font>

331
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,189
people are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at so we'll zoom in</font>

332
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,689
on each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these individually the first</font>

333
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,710
one sorry the first one in the upper

334
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:46,070
left there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 91 21 and 67-62 so it's</font>

335
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:49,040
that is the the worst those they're sort

336
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">of at the core of the badness here if</font>

337
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,599
you zoom in on this you can see

338
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,900
remarkably different<font color="#E5E5E5"> timelines as people</font>

339
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,640
accept and propagate bad prefixes I find

340
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,160
this really interesting that throughout

341
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,780
this event you see you know some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

342
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,100
consistently spiking to you know 20,000

343
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,800
20,000 advertisements some people

344
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,350
spiking up you know as high as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

345
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,990
40,000 in here and then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

346
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">accepting a net total of a whole bunch</font>

347
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,030
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad prefixes but they see them more</font>

348
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,180
trickling in over the

349
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,620
of the hour again these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

350
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot easier for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see on the</font>

351
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,130
web presumably I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to pretend</font>

352
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,060
that y'all aren't reading your email and

353
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're actually looking at the</font>

354
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation on the web it helps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me my</font>

355
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:38,850
therapist told me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that see it</font>

356
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,290
helps it's good um looking at the rates

357
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,120
of advertisements hear you you know

358
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,930
again these are some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SS that</font>

359
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,360
did did less badly were hurt less badly

360
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,819
but still still got hurt pretty fun um

361
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,530
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting thing so when we</font>

362
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,750
did a first pass of this presentation

363
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,730
and I shared it with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a number</font>

364
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,740
of people who were impacted by the event

365
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,930
a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who were interested</font>

366
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the event the first thing I heard</font>

367
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,459
almost universally was I didn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

368
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,950
single trouble ticket and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard</font>

369
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,360
we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> carried bad prefixes for two</font>

370
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,490
minutes and then we shut that session

371
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">down I heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like over and over and</font>

372
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,970
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again right so I said all right</font>

373
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,610
well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting let's do an</font>

374
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,160
analysis not of the rate of a rival<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

375
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,190
bad prefixes but let's do an analysis of

376
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,620
the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad prefixes carried on a</font>

377
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,570
network / time period so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you do</font>

378
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,130
it so so when we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing data we</font>

379
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,290
write down every update we store them

380
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:34,200
for forever so it's possible to replay

381
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,579
history by you know just simply stepping

382
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,650
through the routing updates and seeing

383
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,260
what would a table be so for each of

384
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,670
these for each of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers that we're</font>

385
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,830
interested in or for each of these I

386
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,020
asses we step through history<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we say</font>

387
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,720
okay you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear a bad</font>

388
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,030
advertisement here we'll remove that

389
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,800
from your you know putative routing

390
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,660
table as soon as we either<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear a</font>

391
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,579
withdrawal or your session to us goes

392
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,719
away if neither of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

393
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,220
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume you still have</font>

394
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,810
that prefix in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> table because I'm a</font>

395
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,030
pair of yours and your haven't withdrawn

396
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,489
it to me and you carried it and what we

397
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:08,370
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that pretty much everyone</font>

398
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,520
carried significant numbers of bad

399
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,980
prefixes over the entire event there was

400
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,210
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there was no we carried it</font>

401
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,280
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two minutes and then it was gone</font>

402
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">there wasn't a single I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked we looked</font>

403
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,680
at and in fact when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you zoom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so so</font>

404
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:25,829
the red on the upper left is 9121 and

405
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,079
67-62 they're the same shape and they're

406
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,960
the worst right so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> peek up above a</font>

407
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,090
hundred thousand prefixes as you

408
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,670
and then they taper off over time and

409
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,920
then there's a sharp decline as you know

410

<font color="#E5E5E5">Telecom Italia shuts down big chunks of</font>

of their peering and starts clearing

413
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,510
this thing out but you see the different

shapes you see the fact like let's zoom

in on this you know look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at AG</font>

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,950
them well after this event ended so um

422
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,390
you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not singling anyone out at</font>

423
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,800
all right different people carry

424
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:14,090
different numbers of bad prefixes for

425
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:17,089
different amounts of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yes are</font>

426
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,130
these additional prefixes so these are

427
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,900
people carrying like 200,000 prefixes in

428
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,900
the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> or these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're carrying</font>

429
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,720
a best path that's wrong for what was a

430
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,640
good prefix previously yes so these

431
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,670
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for everything we call a</font>

432
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,980
bad prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a prefix that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

433
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,020
was not in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stable previously</font>

434
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,630
or was in this peer stable previously

435
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,910
but originated by a different a s and so

436
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:45,350
these are prefixes that are newly

437
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,880
originated by 9121 yeah so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

438
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,680
my perspective maybe you guys don't care

439
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,290
about you know 45 minutes or an hour of

440
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrying 20 or 30</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or 40,000 bad prefixes</font>

441
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,640
but to me this is pretty catastrophic

442
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee bad for people who had no direct</font>

443
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,550
connection for the most part to this is

444
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:03,470
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> Turkey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at other people the</font>

445
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,629
shapes are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know somewhat different</font>

446
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,760
but you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the situation is the</font>

447
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,420
same you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know here tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> globe peaks at</font>

448
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,579
14 and comes down sharply limelight for

449
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,200
some reason you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Peaks late and then</font>

450
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,540
dropped sharply<font color="#CCCCCC"> and here's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

451
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,490
about where's bill he's not here he

452
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,839
could tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that's about um so</font>

453
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,370
again these are worth looking at and

454
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,409
they're worth looking at in the context

455
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,629
of I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is much more interesting</font>

456
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and much more important data than the</font>

457
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,450
rate of announcement you know router

458
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">geek people who are doing this like</font>

459
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,690
routing traffic analysis are always

460
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,010
talking about rates of this and rates of

461
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,350
that but the reality is what you guys

462
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,000
care about is traffic and traffic is

463
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,889
dictated by the routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you carry</font>

464
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,600
like what routes are installed on your

465
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,300
network that dictate how you r out the

466
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,889
traffic

467
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,590
so these are pretty important slides and

468
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,090
i encourage you to to look at them let

469
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,520
me give some notes about these<font color="#CCCCCC"> results</font>

470
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,820
quickly all of the prefix counts are

471
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,690
lower bounds and let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain that if</font>

472
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,610
a network is not a peer of mine which

473
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,080
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these networks are not then it's</font>

474
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,969
quite possible that they carried even

475
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,240
more bad prefixes and I just didn't know

476
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,670
about it now we tried to supplement our

477
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,320
data with we didn't try to we did we

478
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,690
supplemented our data with right datum

479
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,480
with route views data so for as many

480
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,790
large networks as are on here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

481
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,410
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> find we supplemented data with</font>

482
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,030
someone who peered directly with them

483
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,650
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are networks on here and</font>

484
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,690
networks who aren't on here who should

485
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,980
be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> here who don't pier with me and</font>

486
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,220
don't pair with route views and don't

487
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,840
pier with ripe our ass<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so therefore</font>

488
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,990
unless i peer with a customer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> theirs</font>

489
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's single home to them it's possible</font>

490
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">there that it was even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse so if you</font>

491
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:44,490
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is bad it's actually a lower</font>

492
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:47,370
bound on bad so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's some operational</font>

493
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,350
lessons I don't operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> a backbone so</font>

494
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,479
these are entirely proxy operational

495
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,000
lessons but they should be Avant obvious

496
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,300
um holiday staffing was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem for a</font>

497
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,270
lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this it was Christmas</font>

498
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,820
Eve day it hit at five in the morning

499
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,410
east coast time you know I got paged by

500
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,720
a lot of other people got<font color="#E5E5E5"> paged by it</font>

501
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,050
but holiday staffing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Knox was light</font>

502
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,810
and response times were slow as a result

503
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:14,610
I heard stories of Knox refusing to

504
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,470
reset<font color="#CCCCCC"> maxpreps sessions that were</font>

505
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,280
because change management had to be

506
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,480
invoked the change management is good

507
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,629
change management should not cover

508
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,790
resetting a max press out session it's

509
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,070
just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know pay</font>

510
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,230
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things I heard lots</font>

511
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,790
of stories of contact and escalation

512
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,650
procedures that hadn't recently been

513
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,990
tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the blocking and tackling</font>

514
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,460
of peering but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ren would kill</font>

515
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,170
me if I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff up</font>

516
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,120
here a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have</font>

517
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,260
escalation paths<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-established and</font>

518
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,330
tested and didn't have contact

519
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:49,800
information well established<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tested</font>

520
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:51,419
so you know 5am<font color="#CCCCCC"> East time 2 a.m. pacific</font>

521
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,340
time is not when you you know when you

522
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">just ended up with 20 or 30,000 bad</font>

523
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,840
prefixes in your tables and<font color="#E5E5E5"> five or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

524
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,850
or

525
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're 30 max prep sessions that's not</font>

526
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,580
the time to figure out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

527
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,699
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> good contact information for your</font>

530
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them my claim is that that really</font>

531
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,330
didn't help anyone people ended up with

532
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,678
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad prefixes they were</font>

534
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,000

535
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,830
picked up different bad routes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to hurt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have tight</font>

538
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:24,908

539
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,649
peers unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a very small</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">number of adjacencies I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it</font>

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">will help you that much so the</font>

542
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,350
fundamental lesson i believe is

543
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,000
transitively trusting all your peers and

544
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:37,029
all your peers customers is

545
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,580
fundamentally unsafe so here's some

546
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,110
future work that needs to be done here's

547
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,990
that here's the lovely problem setting

548
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,908
so what I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's impossible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

549
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,090
large<font color="#CCCCCC"> a esas to prefix filter their</font>

550
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:50,649
peers can't be done totally impossible

551
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,330
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's certain</font>

552
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,250
kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> maxpreps settings are hard on</font>

553
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,809
some kinds of hardware that's mostly

554
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,919
gone away for<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people but some</font>

555
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,350
people fight but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's basically</font>

556
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">impossible on the people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our people</font>

557
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,399
don't update their routing registry

558
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,840
information so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have no source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

559
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:06,610
good data you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect the good</font>

560
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">data there's no way to know which</font>

561
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,389
prefixes any peer of any size<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

562
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,549
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> send you so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> totally</font>

563
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,980
impossible and it's also impossible to

564
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:17,470
filter large a SS on a s origination for

565
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,899
the same reason you<font color="#E5E5E5"> jas origination is</font>

566
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,460
actually harder on lots of routers now

567
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:23,199
because it involves regular expressions

568
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,600
that aren't as fast but that could be

569
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">fixed but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the data you</font>

570
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,740
don't have good<font color="#E5E5E5"> data on this this is</font>

571
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,059
totally impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I hear</font>

572
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,100
but the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> model is you trust all</font>

573
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,289
your peers transitively and we have to

574
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,730
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> since people are imperfect</font>

575
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:38,500
mistakes like this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to</font>

576
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,120
happen and when mistakes like this

577
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,190
continue to happen the evidence is that

578
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the damage is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not contained the damage</font>

579
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,789
is extremely widespread and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's bad for</font>

580
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,740
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people for significant amounts</font>

581
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:49,419
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so therefore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should really</font>

582
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,919
seriously look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at doing those impossible</font>

583
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:58,260
things we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the previous</font>

584
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:59,919
slide so that is the spiel yes Patrick I

585
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,340
Patrick get more from Akamai

586
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:06,610
Technologies you said max prefixes don't

587
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,678
help much but we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> telia avoid getting</font>

588
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,990
a hundred thousand bad prefixes down to

589
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:11,059
some

590
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:14,270
like 16,000 bad prefixes that sounds

591
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:16,520
like it helped a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me yeah I mean</font>

592
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,410
in some ways if I didn't overstate the

593
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,490
case for scandal and hyperbole<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it</font>

594
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:26,510
wouldn't get a slot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the speaking so</font>

595
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:28,790
thanks thanks a lot Patrick thanks thank

596
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you no I mean what I need to say is look</font>

597
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,580
tilia the vision that people have of

598
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,620
maximum prefix settings is that the help

599
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,689
to the extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the maximum prefix</font>

600
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,570
setting and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they help to the</font>

601
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,760
extent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregate of free prefixes</font>

602
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,860
on all your sessions and the propagation

603
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,240
pattern of the badness so right it's

604
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,340
totally ridiculous to say they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

605
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,050
help of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> they help but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Celia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

606
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,090
good max so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Telecom Italia</font>

607
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't sent max prep at all and they did</font>

608
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,389
end up with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven thousand</font>

609
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,730
prefixes and that was bad on that one

610
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,500
session and it was bad thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> tilia</font>

611
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,360
said it actually really quite well and

612
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,130
they still ended up with 11,000 bad

613
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,240
prefixes so yeah it's not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

614
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,410
doesn't help<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all it said it doesn't</font>

615
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">help enough in my estimation I very</font>

616
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:15,500
green Francisco I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're using a</font>

617
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:18,350
screwdriver to hammer in a nail okay max

618
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,670
prefix you know for the problem you

619
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,790
describe them it's a nasty problem

620
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,440
describing but it's wrong tool set to

621
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,570
take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this problem from the tools</font>

622
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have available right now I mean</font>

623
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,350
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what sort of prefix filter</font>

624
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,670
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> nes pass filtering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you put</font>

625
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,439
ingress and egress to your network

626
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,480
whether it's your peers or your

627
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,090
customers so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the toolset that</font>

628
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,610
failed at this point max prefex was a

629
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,010
safeguard for max wid where your rib

630
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,120
blows out from because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you get</font>

631
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,010
into so much stuff in your rib just

632
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">blows out so I think you're appointing</font>

633
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,600
people to the wrong tool the problem you

634
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,790
described in max prefex wasn't designed

635
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">to protect against it's a mitigator</font>

636
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">against you know it could help you can</font>

637
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,030
hammer you can hammer a nail in with the

638
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,710
screwdriver<font color="#CCCCCC"> epil I wasn't recommend it</font>

639
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,910
but but so here's the thing Barry the

640
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,290
reason I'm talking about it is because

641
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the only thing people are using</font>

642
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,610
on their pairing sessions and that's why

643
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to point people to that rest is</font>

644
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,350
a screwdriver trying to hammer on a nail

645
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,149
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other tool</font>

646
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,800
sets we have available that that is why

647
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about prefix filtering peers</font>

648
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,178
but when you when you look at what

649
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are saying about prefixed</font>

650
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:22,850
filtering peers

651
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,429
finally a big is in here who carries

652
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,350
more than you know 10,000 prefixes who

653
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:29,000
peers with more than 30 other asses

654
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,459
that's willing to prefix filter their

655
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,679
peers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know of any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back so</font>

656
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,570
we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them just the bogan work</font>

657
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you take take the problem</font>

658
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">apart so you take the problem all right</font>

659
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,529
you wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> help this it I know it</font>

660
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:41,480
wouldn't help this but see what again

661
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:43,039
it's so wanted one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we what</font>

662
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,080
happens is people try to solve the whole

663
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,700
problem they try to solve the whole

664
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,960
problem all at once<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so what you do</font>

665
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,460
is you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prom part because if you</font>

666
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,960
get everybody do more okay if you got

667
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,520
bogans done then you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next one</font>

668
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,830
didn't even accident<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accent get why</font>

669
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sir so he was I'll hand over to somebody</font>

670
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,149
who does do prefix voltaren and

671
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:02,000
everything so here's Derek so so I'll

672
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:03,979
disagree with Barry you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

673
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,460
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for when then did additional</font>

674
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,970
max prefixes more control let's of in

675
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:13,370
your adage<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a screwdriver but a</font>

676
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:17,899
screwdriver that looked like a Swiss

677
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:20,629
watch so I you know you know something

678
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:23,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was a bit more flexible a switch</font>

679
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,580
knife or whatever the right place is so

680
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:29,750
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the question I started out with</font>

681
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:31,370
rather than peed on the hammer and snail

682
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just like the mailing list</font>

683
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:37,699
bad metaphors run awry yeah like they

684
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:40,520
say I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at home so which ones</font>

685
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:45,260
like a plumber again<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it does to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

686
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:47,210
the adages so would morph so would the

687
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">three types of lemon I described to you</font>

688
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,710
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start up would that have</font>

689
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,750
really helped or hindered would've the

690
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,580
graceful restarts with tighter max free

691
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,200
fixes help this or would it just have

692
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,899
been one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tools in the toolkit</font>

693
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,549
yeah I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it since you asked</font>

694
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:05,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">me before the presentation here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

695
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:07,039
sense if you set up your max prefix is

696
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,860
under the scheme that you were

697
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,570
describing tighter and such that you

698
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,120
stopped accepting new announcements

699
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,710
after you hit the limit then it would

700
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,418
have helped somewhat in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense that</font>

701
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,010
your total number of free accepted

702
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:21,669
prefixes across your peers that would

703
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,929
have been lower it still wouldn't have

704
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:25,159
solved the problem it still wouldn't

705
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,450
have contained the damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an</font>

706
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,760
acceptable level but it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

707
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,649
contained it more the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

708
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,410
you still would have had max craft out

00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:33,479
sessions

710
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:35,250
you tons and tons of peers you know all

711
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,540
tracing back to the single event and

712
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,000
people still would have carried large

713
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,310
numbers of bogus<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements for you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">deal damage more problem but you would</font>

716
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,219
have needed something like prefix

717
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,390
filtering of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort Nordic I can't</font>

718
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,010
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a good way to solve this</font>

719
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:54,150
problem without prefix filtering but I'd

720
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:56,940
be interesting yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just just</font>

721
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:59,070
as the moderator we have five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes so</font>

722
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,820
I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be quick I if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you all want to</font>

723
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:05,909
talk y'all got to be quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi jared</font>

724
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,520
montz from<font color="#CCCCCC"> vario we have historically</font>

725
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:11,850
prefix filtered our peers specifically

00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,070
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Europe at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public exchange points</font>

727
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,480
because ripe has good policies on

728
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,990
ensuring people have their routes

729
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,580
registered properly which presently most

730
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,980
of the us-based carriers<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

731
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,860
their routes registered properly so it

732
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,240
makes it difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to filter we ended up</font>

733
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,949
with eight megabyte router

734
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,080
configurations on some of our routers in

735
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,060
Europe to profit to properly prefix

736
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,710
filter our peers which<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked quite well</font>

737
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:38,129
it meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we didn't have problems</font>

738
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:40,470
with max prefix filtering there because

739
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:43,440
that configuration size got to be big we

740
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:46,260
had to convert some people to max prefix

741
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,000
some of the larger people but you know

742
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,370
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is possible to be</font>

743
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,530
done on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your routers and if your</font>

744
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,419
router's don't have enough nvram or

745
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,760
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suggest that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

746
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,880
alternative ways to do it and work on

747
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,590
getting everyone to register the routes

748
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,090
such that they can be filtered properly

749
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,550
otherwise you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have problems</font>

750
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:08,340
yep and it is possible to do on a large

751
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,919
scale good that's a that's an important

752
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,860
comment yes so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

753
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:16,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">well put 2914 ended up carrying a peak</font>

754
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,929
of just under just around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 bad</font>

755
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,699
prefixes and never went you know mostly

756
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,250
around two so that's considerably less

757
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,980
bad than many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people the quick comment</font>

758
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,080
that i have about route registries is

759
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,570
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

760
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">been hearing people in the u.s. say you</font>

761
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,010
know if everybody would just update all

762
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,420
the routing registries and get all their

763
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,740
customers to update all the routing

764
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,470
registries than we could do all this

765
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,470
great stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is definitely true</font>

766
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,360
but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen big</font>

767
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">movement in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US and in fact I see in</font>

768
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,070
north america i see a retrograde in that

769
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:49,750
front so I'm a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit skeptical and</font>

770
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,460
depressed about solutions that rely on

771
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,870
correct routing registry data even

772
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:58,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">though it works well in Europe right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

773
00:28:52,870 --> 00:29:02,229
but yeah nope eat at<font color="#CCCCCC"> rmc I know hey it's</font>

774
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:04,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">not working sick my one question was by</font>

775
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,539
appear do you mean bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer like any</font>

776
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,149
peer at all oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry yeah Jason</font>

777
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:14,200
see ya<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so inside of at least MCI's</font>

778
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:17,710
networker unit we prefix filter every

779
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,539
customer we max prefix them we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font>

780
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,970
pass filters against<font color="#E5E5E5"> some bad a s hats</font>

781
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:24,850
so we have seven or eight things we do

782
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:27,010
for every<font color="#CCCCCC"> beach be peer of a customer</font>

783
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:31,120
right sorry do you prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> to filter your</font>

784
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:33,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">sessions with 3356 for no for large</font>

785
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,418
private years that song that's the

786
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,460
problem is yeah the last thing said it

787
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:37,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's kind of an</font>

788
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">all-or-nothing it's not an</font>

789
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:42,039
all-or-nothing deal but it is the extent

790
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,840
if you have significant capacity on any

791
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,970
significant number of sessions that

792
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,309
normally carry large numbers of prefixes

793
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,530
you're going to end up with crap because

794
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:53,860
if any of their customers customers or

795
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,840
peers give them a mean it what are you

796
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,389
gonna do if level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three sends you 20,000</font>

797
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,699
bad prefixes they'll blow their prefix

798
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,409
limit don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it right but</font>

799
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah no it's great that you do that i</font>

800
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:06,010
mean if everybody this is one of those

801
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:08,260
wonderful universal things if everybody

802
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:12,340
could trust everybody else to correctly

803
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:16,419
filter their customers then it would all

804
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:20,080
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better but oh yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font>

805
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:22,090
about the if we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP original</font>

806
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">ennock ation mechanism that actually</font>

807
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:27,699
worked with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Avila v8</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this issue</font>

808
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,650
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that certainly that seems so</font>

809
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,990
dramatically less plausible to me in the

810
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,789
short run than prefix filtering peers I

811
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,440
mean what we could do is we could put

812
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:36,940
crypto engines on routers and make sure

813
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,530
they worked on line cards and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font>

814
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,380
can cryptographically sign every

815
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,610
advertisement to write you again it's

816
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,620
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those like and then we could</font>

817
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,570
update all the routing registry<font color="#CCCCCC"> too yes</font>

818
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,428
but nobody's doing that nobody looks

819
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,340
like they're planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it a question</font>

820
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:53,910
for the room if certain router vendors

821
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,620
actually did a reach an authentication

822
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,390
would it actually get deployed could I

823
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,689
see a show of hands of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who would</font>

824
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:07,550
deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> them oh that hurts that's not</font>

825
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:10,920
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all there's a couple yeah yeah</font>

826
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:13,350
Tony basically asked my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh but</font>

827
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:17,280
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but no it's that's fine but I think</font>

828
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:19,889
actually the it you have to rephrase the

829
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,530
question a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit and say I don't</font>

830
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's it's obvious for everyone how</font>

831
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy it would be if if it's engineered</font>

832
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,480
right and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to need to do</font>

833
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the crypto stuff if it's just</font>

834
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,350
something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on and it's not based</font>

835
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:38,250
on routing registries it's in the

836
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,860
protocol and and the controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

837
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,170
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> space get certified by the rirs</font>

838
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:45,449
I think it's a quite viable thing and

839
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:48,210
what would have turned this off dead yep

840
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:51,470
yeah I think that there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

841
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,850
probably five or ten good long-term

842
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,350
solutions to this problem and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

843
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,540
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> group of people to look at those</font>

844
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">long-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I hear things like you</font>

845
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,139
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> signing originations and getting</font>

846
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,090
routing registries in North America

847
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,560
today I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those as like five to</font>

848
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:07,770
ten year out things and maybe that's

849
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,090
just pessimistic so I'm interested in

850
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:17,940
what can be done in the slight shorter

851
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:19,919
term Steve Steve<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay make sure they say</font>

852
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right data is</font>

853
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,230
quite good for building rap filters and

854
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,940
things the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a customer I</font>

855
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,410
built a prefix filter for them i got

856
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,330
like two thousand entries but they were

857
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,620
only sending me like 50 prefixes because

858
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,330
they got so much stuff in there they

859
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,929
were referencing a s macros that they

860
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,919
didn't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> announce any more if you</font>

861
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at let's say we had</font>

862
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,940
appearing with level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 for example if we</font>

863
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,110
built a prefix filter from from whatever

864
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,450
they have in their registries if we

865
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,669
ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a filter that had 150,000</font>

866
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,380
prefixes in it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help us</font>

867
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,290
because if somebody behind them announce

868
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,280
just if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be announcing</font>

869
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,260
we're still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept it because</font>

870
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,850
we match the prefix not the prefix + the

871
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,320
IAS path but see now you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just being</font>

872
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,060
depressing because you're like taking

873
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,840
one of the most up-to-date registries

874
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,560
and saying it it too<font color="#CCCCCC"> is crap well I</font>

875
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,389
really like oh the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best regice</font>

876
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,399
you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people know of it's chock full</font>

877
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,650
of useless car I'm saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Barry</font>

878
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Barry mentioned using prefix filters you</font>

879
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,590
said all that I'd be great the problem

880
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,260
is if you do prefix filters it wouldn't

881
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:19,090
help if somebody isn't announcing things

882
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,370
from the wrong de esta<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe you</font>

883
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,110
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> control you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to control how</font>

884
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,850
the how they rate you can't just allow

885
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:27,159
people to register whatever the heck

886
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:31,240
they want in any registry and then trust

887
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,440
that that that's half of it but if I

888
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,630
have a pairing session with you and it

889
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,250
says I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept this prefix yeah</font>

890
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,930
you're assuming it's going to come from

891
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,630
the is that you think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

892
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:42,850
from if somebody else somewhere

893
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:44,560
originates the prefix like this is did

894
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,300
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll accept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it because it's in the</font>

895
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:51,250
filter we're not checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet do you see</font>

896
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:53,970
a plus yes yeah absolutely good well

897
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,970
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all very much</font>
