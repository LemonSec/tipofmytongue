1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
okay the goal of this presentation is to

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,670
try and describe the various ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,150
nras traffic engineering cases that

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">exist today for v4 and to try and put</font>

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,680
those forward as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> strawman for</font>

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,800
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ipv6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing</font>

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,470
solutions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully this will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,269
define additional operational

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,348
requirements for v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming</font>

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,000
solutions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,719
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what is the</font>

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,739
conflict<font color="#CCCCCC"> between ipv4 and ipv6 it's</font>

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,890
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recognize that ipv4 very</font>

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:46,349
strongly in terms of stewardship is very

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,600
strongly in favor of fair um I'm sorry

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,180
good use of the space being efficient

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,030
use of the space with v6 it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,980
we have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of space much like</font>

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,559
we did in the v4 world in the 80s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,468
the efficient use of space is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,539
important instead what's important is to

22
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,000
aggregate the space because we don't

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,100
want to see many many d aggregates in

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,920
the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table because there's huge</font>

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,470
potential for the routing table to grow

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,409
so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this I ETF and the</font>

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,759
regional Internet routing registries

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,560
basically have put forward policies that

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,680
say you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to announce only a</font>

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,750
single aggregate and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing work and v4 today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you d</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming solution that does not</font>

35
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,579
problem with this is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't D</font>

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,610
aggregate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> neelys routing information</font>

37
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,929
so how do you still do<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing and</font>

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,890
traffic engineering without this

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,799
additional routing information there's a

40
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:54,329
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of places where ITF requirements</font>

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:58,560

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,779
multi6 v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming 03 these talked</font>

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,990
about the need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have failover they</font>

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to dial traffic</font>

around a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad link there's some some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,068
<font color="#CCCCCC">in here about being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to policy route</font>

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,400
and to shift traffic around a

48
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,980
performance degradation

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,989
but even with these requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> defined</font>

50
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">I maintain that there's still no clear</font>

51
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:22,860
ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming solution that supports</font>

52
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:26,109
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipv4 current cases used today</font>

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,900
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are those cases there's three</font>

54
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,840
basic flavors primary backup load

55
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,400
sharing across all of your links and the

56
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,780
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're using the best or</font>

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,359
shortest path between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source and</font>

58
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,640
destination in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to these three</font>

59
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:41,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases there's the additional requirement</font>

60
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,599
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to shift traffic around in</font>

61
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,040
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases so that way if</font>

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,420
you have a link that's over<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilized you</font>

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,720
can migrate some of the traffic away

64
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,458
from that link the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourth thing I want</font>

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,959
to point out is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these three cases</font>

66
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,269
are actually the building blocks and

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,750
they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> combined together and very</font>

68
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:01,859
interesting in complex ways so case one

69
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,420
primary backup what is this basically

70
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:06,400
here the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> designate</font>

71
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,518
a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a set of links to be primary</font>

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,230
and other links or sets of links to be

73
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,420
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so basically what should happen</font>

74
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,548
is the primary links should carry all

75
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,168
the traffic the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup link should never</font>

76
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:20,139
carry traffic unless all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the primary</font>

77
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:22,870
links fail the common reason for a

78
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:25,239
primary backup configuration is simply a

79
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,849
matter of expensed in terms of the links

80
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,829
and you can measure expense in different

81
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,500
ways it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the cost of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the link in</font>

82
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,269
terms of dollar value one link you might

83
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,599
be charged per packet the other link you

84
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,340
might have a flat rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example could</font>

85
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,840
be cost to the link in terms of latency

86
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,729
one link might have much better

87
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">performance than the other so you want</font>

88
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:47,079
to try and use your better performing

89
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,060
link first and then only failover to

90
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:53,590
your poor link it could also be

91
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,449
bandwidth as well so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this the</font>

92
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,159
way in which this configuration works is

93
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:59,560
different depending upon whether you

94
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,530
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single AAS as your upstream or</font>

95
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,010
multiple asses as your upstream with a

96
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,560
single ass the way you can do primary

97
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,349
backup is to set either a high med on

98
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,530
your backup path or a lower med on your

99
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,478
primary path in the case here that i

100
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,060
have shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm showing two different a</font>

101
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,339
esas in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> a multi-homed customer</font>

102
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,789
is advertising a / 23 to both providers

103
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,869
on the backup link they're sending a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

104
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,969
community which will be

105
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,729
interpreted by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP to set a low</font>

106
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,979
local pref on the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> link they're</font>

107
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,630
just doing a standard announcement so

108
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:37,169
what will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this will draw all</font>

109
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,880
inbound traffic across the primary link

110
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:42,250
for outbound traffic that can be done a

111
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,190
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways you can have waited</font>

112
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,350
static default routes in this case I'm

113
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,260
learning a default route via<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP from</font>

114
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,419
both providers and setting either a high

115
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,370
local pref on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the primary link or a look</font>

116
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:58,780
and or a low local pref<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the backup</font>

117
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,639
link the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is load sharing and</font>

118
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,849
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're trying to do is to</font>

119
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">load traffic on all of your links and to</font>

120
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,560
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get them as heavily loaded as</font>

121
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,138
possible without negatively impacting

122
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,639
individual traffic flows and typically

123
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,949
why people are doing this is to try and

124
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,590
squeeze as much bandwidth out of all of

125
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,560
their multiple links and there's many

126
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,030
reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might want to do this</font>

127
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,729
one cases where larger links are cost

128
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,229
prohibitive you may be in an area<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

129
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,659
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> where large circuits are</font>

130
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,070
unavailable or very expensive or you

131
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:36,060
might be a small company who can't

132
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:38,950
afford to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go from a ds1 to a ds3 so</font>

133
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,860
inbound traffic in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case is</font>

134
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,690
basically manipulated by having more

135
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,940
specific as well as your aggregate

136
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,500
announcements so in this case what the

137
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer has done is he's</font>

138
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,320
divided his / 23 and 22 / 24 he's

139
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:56,139
advertising this last 23 to both

140
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,860
upstream ISPs he's advertising only the

141
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:03,310
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> half to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Union at mci and the bottom</font>

142
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,470
half only 280 in terms of outbound

143
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,860
traffic there's and this will basically

144
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,479

either<font color="#E5E5E5"> link fails the other link will</font>

148
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,750
pick up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic for outbound traffic</font>

149
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,389
there is a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways that you can</font>

150
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:26,710
do this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have equal cost static</font>

151
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:28,300
routes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply learn a static</font>

152
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,770
default from both providers that will

153
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">also work the third</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font>

154
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,060
to use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonrandom best path and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

155
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,270
qualify this by saying for some

156
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,030
definition of

157
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the current definition of best is</font>

158
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,159
based on the BGP routing table

159
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:49,070
information and is determined<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the BGP</font>

160
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,260
path selection algorithm the important

161
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,610
point here is not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best path is</font>

162
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,190
determined based on routing information

163
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,040
but that it approximates the shortest

164
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,510
path between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source and destination</font>

165
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,360
in this case inbound traffic is

166
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,430
manipulated by learning a full<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP table</font>

167
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,620
from both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your providers and simply</font>

168
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,210
allowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp to do the right thing and</font>

169
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,180
same for outbound outbound traffic you

170
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,669
advertise the same announcement to both

171
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,960
of your up streams and let the far end

172
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:22,550
make the right decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fourth</font>

173
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,169
requirement is it replies to the first

174
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,050
three is the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dial traffic</font>

175
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,630
around and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is because BGP</font>

176
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,950
lacks a congestion control mechanism now

177
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,810
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not suggesting there should be a</font>

178
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,479
congestion control mechanism that's not

179
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,000
what BGP is designed to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> since it</font>

180
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,550
does lack one people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> invented ways</font>

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,340
to kind of shift traffic around so that

182
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,780
they can draw some traffic away from

183
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,859
over utilized links and onto

184
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,630
underutilized links so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go</font>

185
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,060
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases and show how</font>

186
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,159
traffic dialing applies to each of them

187
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,500
in the first case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a primary</font>

188
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,300
link which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is becoming over utilized so</font>

189
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,910
what you want to do is try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and migrate</font>

190
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,920
some small amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic off of the</font>

191
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,740
primary length<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto that more expensive</font>

192
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,870
backup link but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and</font>

193
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,340
migrate as little as traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible</font>

194
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,880
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to keep most of your</font>

195
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,729
traffic on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary link k</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stew is</font>

196
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,950
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that where you have</font>

197
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,570
multiple load shared links in this case

198
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might have one or more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your links</font>

199
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,900
running a little hot so in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

200
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,200
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to migrate a small amount of</font>

201
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,940
traffic towards the underutilized links

202
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,560
the way in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do this is you try</font>

203
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,720
to draw traffic to either<font color="#E5E5E5"> the backup</font>

204
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,090
link or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your underutilized load</font>

205
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,940
shared links by advertising some more

206
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:41,120
specifics across that path so basically

207
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,490
what will happen is much like the load

208
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,110
shared case you simply divide up your

209
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,840
network differently so you might

210
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,060
advertise instead of a 24 and a 24 you

211
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,720
might advertise maybe a 29 across one of

212
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">your links</font>

213
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,029
to draw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extra traffic for</font>

214
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,000
outbound you've got basically two

215
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:01,250
choices one choice is by doing some

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,500
dialing of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp metrics to try and</font>

217
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,930
make some sources a little bit closer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

218
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,660
one of your exit points assuming you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

219
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,579
have discreet exit points the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way</font>

220
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,370
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can listen to some</font>

221
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">of your specific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inbound prefixes pick</font>

222
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,629
some routes and distance them so that

223
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:21,859
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be more preferred across</font>

224
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:23,389
particular outbound paths in case three

225
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,970
it's a little bit more complicated

226
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:27,319
because basically what we're trying to

227
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,600
do is we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get everybody on</font>

228
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:31,699
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to use the best path but</font>

229
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,649
your one best path maybe is getting

230
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:35,540
overloaded so you want to migrate some

231
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,759
small amount of traffic to your

232
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,769
underutilized link but in this case

233
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,110
you're being very<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular about the</font>

234
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to migrate the</font>

235
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,589
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want to migrate is</font>

236
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:48,258
traffic that is fairly close to both

237
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:51,709
your primer your best path and then your

238
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:53,629
second best path so somebody who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

239
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,339
close to your best path but very far

240
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:57,829
away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your second best path you</font>

241
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,779
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic to migrate the</font>

242
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:03,050
way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is typically done is by doing a</font>

243
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:06,319
as prepending if that's not granular

244
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,300
enough then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also do additional</font>

245
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,209
more specific prefixes announcements

246
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">like in the previous case but that</font>

247
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:15,739
doesn't necessarily follow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best path</font>

248
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,509
the next best path rule outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

249
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,410
is manipulated in the same way as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

250
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:22,879
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> case the final point I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font>

251
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">to drive home is that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

252
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,639
primary backup load shared and best but

253
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have very interesting</font>

254
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,290
combinations of the two in this case

255
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,899
imagine you have a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> who has</font>

256
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:38,870
connectivity to two isps say you unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

257
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:42,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">80 and the customer wants to use best</font>

258
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,970
path meaning a source customer who's

259
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,160
closer to you unit should come across

260
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,319
the eating at links a customer's closer

261
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,410
to 80 should come across the AT&T links

262
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:54,259
now also imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

263
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,809
your unit consists of a pair of primary

264
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:59,329
links and a pair of backup links while

265
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:02,480
the connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to AT&T consists only of</font>

266
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:03,660
a pair of primary links so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

267
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,570
picture of kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

268
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,510
like the way in which you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

269
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,610
manipulate your traffic is first by

270
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,920
advertising the / 23 to both providers

271
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:17,430
so that way people on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet can</font>

272
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,040
simply choose best path in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

273
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,800
the primary backup configuration with

274
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Union at mci basically what you'll need</font>

275
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,660
to do is if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single multihop</font>

276
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP session for your two lengths or if</font>

277
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,680
you have multiple BGP sessions for all

278
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,050
of your primary links you basically have

279
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,540
to set a meta 0 or allow the default met

280
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 to be your behavior on your backup</font>

281
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,530
links you want to set a higher med value

282
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,020
so basically what will happen in this

283
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,420
configuration is any traffic reaching

284
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,340
Union at mci will choose both of the

285
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,240
primary links unless they both go down

286
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,560
then it will roll to the back up links

287
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,530

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,220
solutions that are currently on the

table are very different and how they

299
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,290
don't support these all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these cases</font>

300
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,390
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of solutions that</font>

301
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:32,280
have been proposed many of them have

<font color="#E5E5E5">general that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

304
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,199
solution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what we're trying</font>

305
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,750
to do is do multihoming that does not

306
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,220
rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the aggregation and the way in</font>

307
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">which you do that is by separating the</font>

308
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,420
locator ID from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper layer ID</font>

309
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:51,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so what is this concept of a</font>

310
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,160
locator ID a locator idea is basically

311
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:56,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the IP address that's on the interface</font>

312
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,579
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your host it's what routers used to</font>

313
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,440
route traffic and in ipv6 you have to

314
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,510
have a unique locator ID for every

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,670
upstream isp so that means if you have a

316
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,340
host a web server for example that's

317
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,540
multihomed you have to upstream ISPs you

318
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,730
need to IP addresses for that hosts the

319
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,540
upper layer ID is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that the</font>

320
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,950
upper layer protocols like<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP or</font>

321
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">icmp used to communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with each other</font>

322
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,240
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why this is kind of</font>

323
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,450
strange for us to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is because</font>

324
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,190
in the ipv4 world the locator ID and the

325
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,690
upper layer ID are the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it's</font>

326
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,450
that single address you have on your

327
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,060
interface card however you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

328
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:38,460
separate them in v6 because what you're

329
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,069
trying to do is build the TCP session

330
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,320
between an upper layer ID and then have

331
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,910
some mechanism to Swift to switch out

332
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,980
the locator ID so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if there's a</font>

333
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:51,240
failure you can choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different</font>

334
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,490
destination or a different source so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

335
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,370
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus in on the l3 shim</font>

336
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,980
approach it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar to some of</font>

337
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,440
the other approaches but the this

338
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,980
approach basically says you need one

339
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,630
unique locator ID or IP address /<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP</font>

340
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:11,640
and you also need a upper layer ID

341
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,410
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of debate about how you</font>

342
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,819
choose an upper layer ID and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

343
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,219
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> should it be globally routable</font>

344
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,450
should it be globally unique does it

345
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,090
need to be routable can it be a

346
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,830
cryptographic hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not really going</font>

347
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,240
to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> those issues and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

348
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,920
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be in the next year or</font>

349
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">so they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what's</font>

350
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,680
the best solution I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to talk</font>

351
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:34,980
about what shim 6 specifies and

352
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,280
basically the way it works is if you do

353
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,420
a quad a query the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS server is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

354
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,500
to provide back a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of locator IDs or</font>

355
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,750
interface IP addresses for that

356
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,430
destination and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the important point to</font>

357
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,610
note here is that list may not be

358
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:53,219
complete the source will choose one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

359
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,460
those addresses at random and attempt to

360
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,080
build the TCP session for example if

361
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,360
that session establishment is

362
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,270
unsuccessful he is then required to try

363
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,730
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> address once the upper layer</font>

364
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,199
communication is successful then the end

365
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,720
hosts can both signal that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

366
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,610
multi6 capable and if they are they can

367
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,400
pass a complete set of locator IDs

368
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,440
between the two endpoints and once that

369
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,640
complete set<font color="#CCCCCC"> is passed they can then</font>

370
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,370
insert<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 header and all of your</font>

371
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcp sessions can switch over to use the</font>

372
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,230
upper layer ID is where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font>

373
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,610
conversation is terminating so just to

374
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,600
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a quick walkthrough of how this</font>

375
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,160
works

376
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,500
on the left here I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a source</font>

377
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,100
that's got three upstream ISPs he's got

378
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,839
three ipv6 addresses on his interface

379
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,690
he's communicating to a destination

380
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,440
who's got to upstream ISPs with two

381
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,149
addresses he does a DNS query he picks

382
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:53,370
one of the addresses at random and

383
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:55,199
starts a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP conversation let's say once</font>

384
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,940
that conversation starts they can signal

385
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're multi6 capable and they can</font>

386
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,860
exchange a complete set of locator IDs

387
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,750
now the source knows all the valid IP

388
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,610
addresses for the destination and the

389
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination knows all the valid IP</font>

390
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:11,370
addresses for the source once this is

391
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,430
all set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then insert the layer</font>

392
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">three shim which includes a source upper</font>

393
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,229
layer ID and a destination upper layer

394
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:22,829
ID with the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three shim approach</font>

395
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:26,639
that key so to speak for the upper layer

396
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:30,300
ID is heat off of what the initial IP

397
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,740
source and IP destination were and again

398
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,540
I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's many schemes of how to</font>

399
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,449
generate what to use for an upper layer

400
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">ID this is just one example so what</font>

401
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:40,380
happens is at some point there's a

402
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,290
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case the destinations</font>

403
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,079
connection to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP 9 dies so what will</font>

404
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,630
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the source will detect that</font>

405
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,829
the traffic forwarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> is stopped and</font>

406
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,529
this is done through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the forwarding</font>

407
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:55,050
plane and he will simply pick another

408
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:58,170
locator ID out of the locator ID set and

409
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:00,180
simply swap that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a new IP destination</font>

410
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,180
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet when that packet arrives</font>

411
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,819
at the destination he will strip off the

412
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,918
IP header<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's left is the layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

413
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:10,530
shim header and that's what's delivered

414
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,750
up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upper layer protocol your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

415
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,569
conversation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what happens</font>

416
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,369
is the IP source or the IP destination

417
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,309
and the packet can change these are the

418
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:22,559
locator IDs but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't impact the</font>

419
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:26,908
TCP session because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an upper</font>

420
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,700
layer ID for its conversation so the

421
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,860
current I ATF solution there's a couple

422
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> points to point out first</font>

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all the traffic engineering</font>

424
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,500
decisions are made<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the source not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,500
the

426
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,720
destination there is provisions for

427
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,470
sources and destinations to detect

428
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,210
failover there's a draft about that they

429
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,220
also say that traffic should load all

430

431
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,600
should only fell over onto working links

432
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,050
and again failure detection is done

434

things to note though is that without

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,160

437
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,720
you can't say customer one of a

438
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,850

439
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,290
not customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to because only the</font>

ability either all the customers are

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,420
reachable in terms of the routing table

446
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:28,060
information or unreachable there's also

447
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,020
no ability to do traffic engineering by

449
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,280
so there's really no provision dial

450
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,560
traffic around there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> provision to</font>

wherever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are on the internet and</font>

453
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:46,780
there's no provision to specifically

455
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,280

excuse me temporarily that you shouldn't

what they're specifying is the

581
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,840
called a requirements document but we

582
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,310
couldn't get consensus until we change

583
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,310
the name from requirement to goals

00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:06,110
didn't come up with all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

590
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,070
you must you know do strict aggregation

591
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,929
so that's what led to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

make that clear right to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point about</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi six requirements document</font>

597
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:33,070
having to be changed some of those

598
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,749
requirements are self contradictory

599
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,918
right so you couldn't call them all

600
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:39,679
requirements because you can't require

601
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,749
things that contradict each other it was

602
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,429
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we had to go is say it's</font>

603
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really requirement because you can't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have both simultaneously and there are</font>

605
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,619
trade-offs that have to be made here

606
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:50,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">this community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has to come to</font>

607
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:53,119
consumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> census and it can't be this</font>

608
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:55,850
room it has to be a global consensus and

609
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,350
we can't just do it all in individual

610
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,869
rooms and random places around the world

611
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,158
we have to come together decide on what

612
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:02,600
is the set of requirements we're really

613
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,789
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to meet and how are we</font>

614
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,869
going to prioritize that list that's you

615
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem you're running</font>

616
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:09,199
into right now is you've got a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

617
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,999
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do which don't meet</font>

618
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,330
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things that have been done in</font>

00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:16,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past the other thing xem six is a</font>

620
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,949
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> concept and maybe in a decade we</font>

621
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,749
can think about doing something with it

622
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,639
but it's it's a at least a decade

623
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:23,960
problem it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take at least</font>

624
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:25,668
three or four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

625
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">three or four years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it built and</font>

626
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:30,830
then another<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four years to fix</font>

627
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:37,149
all the stuff that it broke you are an

optimist at least a decade right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um</font>

629
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:43,158

630
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,259
we need to not get too far behind yeah
