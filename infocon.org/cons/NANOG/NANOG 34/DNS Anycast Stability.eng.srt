okay more of the same but from a

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:10,670
different point of view life and times

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> j root was already mentioned and</font>

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,630
little bit less stability than we had

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,000
expected and why did we have

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,050
expectations well when we deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">cast we also had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a monitoring project on</font>

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,149
which is called DNS mon and we had so

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,000
cursorily looked at the data not done

13
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,910
really a real analysis like peter has

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,140
done but but just looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for some</font>

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:55,860
intuitive results and we didn't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,100
many switches so those two studies

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,219
actually cost us to roll back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look</font>

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,159
at this data and and and see why there

19
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:10,850
was this difference for those who don't

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:15,060
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mon it's a monitoring system</font>

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,850
we've got data since april 2003 and we

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,860
do various queries among them the most

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,369
frequent ones are ID dot server hostname

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,220
that bind same thing as peter did but we

25
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,210
do it every 60 seconds so our resolution

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,590
is not as good as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the every two second</font>

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,270
things that they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> and obviously the</font>

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:42,000
Poisson distributed so that we don't

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,600
we query so on and the software versions

45
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,690
when they were there were well in 2002 a

46
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,760
couple of posts soon a knock among other

47
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,740
lists about you all the root servers are

48
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,109
down and all that had happened so the

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,640
figuratively speaking was that the

50
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,070
person was monitoring this from one

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,500
particular place<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the internet had his</font>

52
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,870
dsl cable connected disconnected and

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,580
then was claiming that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root</font>

54
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,250
servers were down so I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we have</font>

55
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,580
to do it a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more stringently so we do</font>

56
00:02:51,250 --> 00:03:01,090
this from about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 places at the same</font>

57
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:04,330
time well to actually look and correlate

58
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,690
what what we saw with what Peter saw and

59
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,150
what to mark reported I just took almost

60
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,430
a month worth of data from februari

61
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thirteen's to march 9th this year and</font>

62
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,480
it's I just choose that because it was

63
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,140
readily available and I could copy it to

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:24,070
my laptop at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point we have 77 boxes</font>

65
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:27,309
in 59 a esas and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at the same</font>

66
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:31,780
targets as Peter looked at CF I jkm the

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,940
anycast<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service it's about 35,000</font>

68
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,470
queries per propre host for this month

69
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,450
and so it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 million data points</font>

70
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,560
the probe locations are certainly biased

71
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,970
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS monas is run on the</font>

72
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,300
instrumentation that is mainly deployed

73
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,730
in Europe there are few in other areas

74
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,830
and it's also biased in another way in

75
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,310
the sense that most of these things are

76
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,110
at in<font color="#E5E5E5"> within or very close to ISP</font>

77
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,100
infrastructure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are not out in</font>

78
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,350
the fringes of the network it's

79
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,170
basically what the data set looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

80
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:11,200
it's more for reference for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

81
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,630
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it we looked at the global</font>

82
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,200
results of this and there were some 16

83
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,649
million queries and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14,000</font>

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,469
drops that's

85
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:24,739
basically queries that weren't answered

86
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:28,699
so there are ninety-nine point nine

87
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,889
percent happy queries and remember it

88
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:35,479
takes two happy packets to make a happy

89
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:39,259
query query and response so and we saw

90
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,409
much less instance of switches only

91
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,419
point zero two percent just about and

92
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,130
people interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in working on this</font>

you can get the whole file this is

95
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,620
actually the main point why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">acquiring if I'm giving this talk to</font>

98
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,870
about dns service quality it's about

99
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,600
studying bgp instance which is per se do

100
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,580
not mean dns service problems and we've

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,740
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that correlations that Peter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

102
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,479
showed earlier there's some correlation

103
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:18,560
but they're certainly not careers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> +1</font>

104
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:21,560
correlation factor and if we actually

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,340
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service at the unicast</font>

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,949
addresses the picture is like this we

107
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,169
have we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ninety-nine point</font>

108
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:33,199
nine percent happy queries from the

109
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:39,500
anycast service and in the same data set

110
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:41,120
we have just 98.9 percent happy queries

111
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,900
from the unicast service so there's an

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,659
order of magnitude difference here and

113
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:51,888
also no offense to<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font>

114
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">but what people who do not are not</font>

115
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:59,449
intimately familiar with DNS should note

116
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:02,240
is that 98.9 percent is also quite nice

117
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,280
a good enough service because there's 13

118
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,610
redundant servers and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> mirroring</font>

119

all the 13 service<font color="#CCCCCC"> o DNS route services</font>

124
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:29,599
the losses or per root server and we see

125
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,160
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite concentrated</font>

126
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:35,219
in one and that happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

distribution of the switches it wasn't

133
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:58,590
it wasn't so interesting so our first

134
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,300
impression was this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> grease with what</font>

135
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,280
we saw when we just looked at the data

136
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris orally there's a little badness</font>

137
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,429
but not real<font color="#E5E5E5"> ugliness or worse and we</font>

138
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,610
didn't have real hope for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data</font>

139
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,440
set to show us the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Peter</font>

140
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:19,020
and Randy saw because our resolution is

141
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:22,020
lower but then we just lumped all the

142
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,780
data together and we saw the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution that you saw in Peters</font>

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,840
the y axis is appearances and you see

147
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,520
that there's a high number of

148
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,500
occurrences of switches that happen

149
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,740
closely to each other so there must be

150
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,990
some bursty activity there and that's

151
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,200
the point when I decided to do to

152
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,300
actually look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at bgp at the same time</font>

153
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,030
when when we when we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those switches</font>

154
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of examples where</font>

155
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,849
that actually show quite well what's

156
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I use bgp play a BG play to</font>

make to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some movies to show that</font>

158
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:10,230
rather than do a dual analysis it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

159
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,350
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad as some of the stuff that Peter</font>

160
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:15,840
showed but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

161
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,630
bias in location of our probes there

within<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP infrastructure quality</font>

conscious is peace let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> call that are</font>

164
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,840
more likely to have probes because

165
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,490
they're interested in quality and and

166
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,489
it's not on the network fringes

167
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:43,689
hello so my my example here is a s 1853

168
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> K dot reservist net it's one that I</font>

169
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,860
chose because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really illustrates</font>

170
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,400
this very nicely it's not to pick on

171
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,770
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> K root service or a s 1853 it's</font>

172
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,520
just one one that couldn't make a nice

173
00:08:53,770 --> 00:09:00,250
movie from we see that for the whole

174
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,860
period for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole month there were</font>

175
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:08,380
actually 36 switches and eight drops and

176
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:13,200
there were two two instances of<font color="#E5E5E5"> K that</font>

177
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:17,230
were serving this is 1853 what one was

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,770
km6 in<font color="#E5E5E5"> amsterdam and one was k links at</font>

179
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the links in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> london and actually the</font>

180
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,829
switches occurred in eight of the eight

181
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,780
during only<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing eight hours of of this</font>

182
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,810
whole interval so it's in only one point

183
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:35,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever percent of the time of the</font>

184
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:41,339
total time observed this is a data file

185
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:43,990
of those things basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives you time</font>

186
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,990

187
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,490
last switch and you see I group them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

188
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,890
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can see that they they're</font>

189
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:54,010
clustered the first one happens like on

190
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:57,790
februari<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty to twenty second and</font>

191
00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,520
then sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 500 seconds later there's</font>

192
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 240 seconds later there's one 603</font>

193
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,890
seconds later that's one and so and so

194
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:09,790
forth again remember the resolution is

195
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:13,960
is once on<font color="#E5E5E5"> average once a minute and</font>

196
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:16,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's flaps a little between 439 and 537</font>

197
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,030
and then it stabilizes on links of

198
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:22,740
initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on m6 then it flaps a</font>

199
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:26,410
number of times over over about an hour

200
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:29,830
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it stabilizes on links and then</font>

201
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:34,150
another one and a half hours later about

202
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:36,070
it goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> m6 and then another 11</font>

203
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:40,870
hours later it starts flapping again and

204
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,490
so on and so on if we visualize that

205
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,250
usually

206
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,870
VG play we have the original situation

207
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:52,589
the measurement point is on the left

208
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:57,360
hand side it's 1853 for those who can

209
00:10:52,589 --> 00:11:02,690
read it that's there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the target is</font>

210
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:06,300
there this is where K root lives a s25

211
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:09,089
152 and this is this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original</font>

212
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,479
estate and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did is I used to say</font>

213
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">VG play to just see what happens during</font>

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,839
this interval when all these switches

215
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:22,380
happen so hey it switches to to this

216
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,690
path and<font color="#E5E5E5"> while actually if you look here</font>

217
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,480
this path looks like it's it's got one

218
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,940
more hop if you look up there you will

219
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,529
see the actual a s path and you'd see

220
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,089
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s path lengths are actually the</font>

221
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:39,770
same because there's some prepending

222
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:44,459
happening so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lengths are actually</font>

223
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:47,730
equivalent now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we overlay the the</font>

224
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:49,290
original switch data and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> other file</font>

225
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:53,010
to it we see that this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> khong</font>

226
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:55,829
it happens at the same time when when

227
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,709
the switch happens the the time

228
00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:01,589
difference is just that that we that we

229
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:03,029
see the bgp action a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little later is</font>

230
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:06,959
that it takes some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to propagate to</font>

231
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the to the probe of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the routing</font>

232
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,699
information system that actually takes

233
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:16,260
takes this data and it switches back in

234
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:21,000
BGP and it also switches back in our log

235
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:23,430
data and this goes on so the first few

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,120
things that I that you just saw in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

237
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:29,180
file<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the of the probe data it's just</font>

238
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,680
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know these two paths switching and</font>

239
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,209
they're closely match you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

240
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,959
look at the stuff in on a website and

241
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:39,359
you'll see that that was quite

242
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,119
surprising because actually there was

243
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,270
one bgp past<font color="#E5E5E5"> i followed this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rather to</font>

244
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,459
all these 38 or so changes and there's

245
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:50,160
one bgp pass change logged for every

246
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:51,959
instant switch so for this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font>

247
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't we're not missing much because</font>

248
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,040
of

249
00:12:52,769 --> 00:13:00,089
despite our lower probing of frequency

250
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,040
of once a minute the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font>

251
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:04,019
change is probably instability on the

252
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">preferred path and I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now for</font>

253
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:10,079
sure because I present this last week at

254
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:12,420
a tribe and there was someone an

255
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,368
engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone from the transit network</font>

256
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,779
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original one that looked looked</font>

257
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:17,699
and looked in his<font color="#CCCCCC"> logs and during the</font>

258
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,959
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually stood up and said yes I</font>

259
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:24,029
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was there was a link</font>

260
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,998
instability at that time so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no</font>

261
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:28,679
effect it's not not probably and there's

262
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:34,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a little packet loss but not</font>

263
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:37,529
for each switch we can weaken SI los it

264
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:41,850
keeps churning as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I showed you earlier</font>

265
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:45,239
on and I visualize that as well but I

266
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,799
haven't actually locked all of them and

267
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:51,329
superimposed all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's</font>

268
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:53,699
just a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and I'm lazy so all</font>

269
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:58,170
these switches actually we see in the

270
00:13:53,699 --> 00:14:01,709
BGP data and in the DNS probe data and

271
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:05,699
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on it actually solve closed</font>

272
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:10,888
loops it got it goes through different

273
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:13,529
routes I've I'll just show you the other

274
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:15,240
path without showing without showing you

275
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:19,589
the the switches but I looked at them

276
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,779
trust me they all reflected in the end

277
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,869
the DNS probes and if you look carefully

278
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:27,149
up there look at their path lengths you

279
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:30,689
will see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if prepending they</font>

280
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:34,860
actually all the same so it does this

281
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:37,169
and it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you know it's</font>

282
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,189
it's it does lots of this and I looked I

283
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:42,899
looked at some some of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

284
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:47,160
and you could see essentially the same

285
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,629
one it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same pattern the the</font>

286
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason I chose this particular one was</font>

287
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it was so easy to lay out so it's</font>

288
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,629
easy to see so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next question that</font>

289
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,649
came up to my mind is is this unique to

290
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:03,329
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast</font>

291
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:06,459
and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> no unique as prefixes also</font>

292
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:09,689
have lots of paths of equal length and

293
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:17,050
also have instabilities and I just chose

294
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:19,868
another example or out of the same the

295
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:24,519
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeframe to show you which where</font>

296
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:28,389
we have a unicast / 21 also<font color="#E5E5E5"> from 1853</font>

297
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:31,179
and around the same time when this when

298
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:35,679
this link failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened this started</font>

299
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:38,559
doing very similar things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

300
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,179
say one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here which I obviously I</font>

301
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:46,149
forgot if you look at if you look at

302
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:48,519
this these these things 25 152 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

303
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,559
blob here because it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS but in</font>

304
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,959
fact there are many of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

305
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just the whole point about any</font>

306
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">cast so if you if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at this you</font>

307
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:02,259
have to sort of mentally make replicate

308
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:04,689
this this 21 this thing a couple of

309
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:08,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">times because in the in the underlying</font>

310
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:10,949
topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real path the net the</font>

311
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:23,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">packets take these are different</font>

312
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:25,899
destinations<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok going back here so it's</font>

313
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:29,379
basically this basically shows some some

314
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:31,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">PGP instabilities at least the ones that</font>

315
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:35,439
I looked at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not unique to to</font>

316
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:38,998
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast and I i just have as another</font>

317
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:41,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do 1853 2f route and</font>

318
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:43,870
unfortunately this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to</font>

319
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:45,699
see because the colors get chosen

320
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,749
automatically by a BG play and they're

321
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:51,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">not always ideal ones but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see the</font>

322
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:53,949
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of same pattern is there there</font>

323
00:16:51,939 --> 00:17:00,279
is actually bgp answer the instability

324
00:16:53,949 --> 00:17:02,019
here which causes<font color="#CCCCCC"> this some questions</font>

325
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,079
for looking further quite similar to

326
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:07,179
what what Peter said one thing that sort

327
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">of i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intuitively is that there are</font>

328
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,939
possible paths to any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cass prefixes</font>

329
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,260
because they look they actually really

330
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,860
located in<font color="#E5E5E5"> different parts of the</font>

331
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:21,819
topology so there must be more possible

332
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:27,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">AAS paths but is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it really so I didn't</font>

333
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:30,220
look at that is it so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> derived from</font>

334
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,620
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cast briefly show more bgp</font>

335
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:36,160
paths of equal length so that without

336
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,439
policy tiebreaks<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equivalent and</font>

337
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,049
other and other tiebreaks have to have

338
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:46,270
to occur and in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of instability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP</font>

339
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:50,710
flaps more easily is that true I don't

340
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:52,450
know and another possibility which is

341
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,660
actually quite possible is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

342
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normal bgp churn that we just very</font>

343
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:04,200
conveniently see because we can measure

344
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:06,010
it now with with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns protocol over</font>

345
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,169
because because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have we have this</font>

346
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,350
ending cast are there other factors I

347
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:15,520
don't know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is the important</font>

348
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:18,340
bit remember this one this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not about</font>

349
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">a root service quality it's about bgp so</font>

350
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,780
please you know do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not go out there and</font>

351
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,320
say that this means that any cash flow

352
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:29,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns root service is unstable or broken</font>

353
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:32,080
and as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark has quite clearly said</font>

354
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:35,070
this is because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> stateless UDP it's</font>

355
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:44,520
one query packet and a response packet

356
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:44,520
and there any cast works I'm done

357
00:18:49,640 --> 00:19:02,570
discussion 20 minutes we have 20 minutes

358
00:18:53,670 --> 00:19:02,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">for discussion come on folks yeah</font>

359
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:18,980
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony Lee welcome to the wonderful</font>

360
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:22,290
world of debugging vgp do you have any

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:32,640
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point a finger to as</font>

362
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:35,010
to what really<font color="#CCCCCC"> broke no not written yeah</font>

363
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,690
well into intuitively yes but not not

364
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:44,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">really something I would I would want to</font>

365
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:47,460
defend scientifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer I can</font>

366
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:50,010
give the place but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we've we</font>

367
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:56,070
just found a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem or maybe not maybe</font>

368
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:59,070
not a problem what we found was a in

369
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,750
effect and we want to see causes and

370
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,490
things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now all we</font>

371
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,680
know is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's happening and we have</font>

372
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,240
all sorts of ideas but like I pointed

373
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:13,110
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my talk bear rampant speculation</font>

374
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:15,030
but make intuitive sense so switch it

375
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it depends on whether or not the</font>

376
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:21,139
switches track together or differently

377
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,820
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font>

378
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,800
but if you maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to</font>

379
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear but sort of going going from</font>

380
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,440
rampant speculation to to some other

381
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,790
intuitive things it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

382
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,800
there's too much too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> knobs are</font>

383
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:41,250
being turned put too many policy knobs

384
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:44,159
are being turned without actually

385
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:47,030
looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consequences so so this</font>

386
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:50,960
prepending stuff and making making paths

387
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:53,760
trying to to do policy by by prepending

388
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:59,760
maybe other policies that are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

389
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:02,870
are not necessarily consistent obviously

390
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,700
make it a tough job to have a stable

391
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,540
stable routing but that's all conjecture

392
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:12,130
of course mark

393
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:15,190
hello I'm not deemed I'll play one for a

394
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,200
moment actually this isn't so much that

395
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,260
but I'm wondering there's multiple ways

396
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,360
of doing any caste and and we've kind of

397
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,379
looked at sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of for the most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part sort</font>

398
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,899
of global globally available and there's

399
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,190
life for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> f does this no export</font>

400
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,559
sort of thing we're seeing with them

401
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,950
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> within their peers so I'm wondering</font>

402
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,620
if if there was some work done there if

403
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">we would see some a reduction to this</font>

404
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,360
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of path switching and it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

405
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:49,330
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an issue than what we've seen</font>

406
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:51,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">through our three now sort of reports so</font>

407
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,840
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that ah because we saw a</font>

408
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,330
pretty significant amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font>

409
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,428
switching on on all the routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean f</font>

410
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,040
wasn't particularly better or worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

411
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:02,110
any others i recall well you saw their

412
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,820
their global instance you didn't see the

413
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,490
things that were you know within their

414
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,460
own little sort of their own any cat

415
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,860
spots are out there same same thing with

416
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,260
I that what you were seeing was a small

417
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,510
number of servers which have global

418
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,270
routing whereas the vast majority of the

419
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,309
servers are only this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bowl within the</font>

420
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,410
context of the internet exchange and the

421
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:26,710
peers directly adjacent to the internet

422
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,480
exchange in any given locality so you're

423
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,270
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing with I and F and I</font>

424
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,210
suspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of the others right so what</font>

425
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:39,220
you're seeing is a behavior that's only

426
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:42,610
visible from places that don't that

427
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:46,660
aren't downstream from a peer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

428
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,540
that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cursory observations I</font>

429
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,850
had on the on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS mon data that's</font>

430
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,280
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what I see to say it in one</font>

431
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,730
sentence is if you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> local instance</font>

432
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,889
it's more likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be stable but but</font>

433
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,960
but but they're also they're also the

434
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:06,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">last example I showed is actually a</font>

435
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:11,420
counter example it's big because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it</font>

436
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,889
when this one becomes unstable you you

437
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,440
switch to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global and if you have</font>

438
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:20,630
multiple Global's it can be it can do

439
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:23,210
the stuff that you just saw yes I'm your

440
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,430
headman one question that came to mind

441
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,550
is there's a lot of multipath routing

442
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:31,600
and with some of the tiebreaking being

443
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:34,340
fairly arbitrary the question is whether

444
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,040
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passages that you are seeing</font>

445
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:44,510
are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> artifacts of multipath routing</font>

446
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:48,409
was in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp I don't get it similarly</font>

447
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:52,340
so you say what we're seeing is

448
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:55,730
artifacts of igp things so basically if

449
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,919
you have some load balancer or some

450
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,350
other kind of boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll tell that are</font>

451
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,870
purposely rebalancing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

452
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:05,209
between two different routes and then

453
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:08,030
you have some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> artifact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there that</font>

454
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,620
might actually explain why put one UDP

455
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,160
packet you go this way and for another

456
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,540
that way right but if they're in that

457
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of thing we would expect a</font>

458
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">different sort of distribution than what</font>

459
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,830
we actually saw and what we saw was

460
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,420
didn't look like the sort of

461
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,699
distribution you would expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font>

462
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,010
which would be sort of a classic

463
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,260
classical sort of either<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

464
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,410
deterministic or astonish or something

465
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,790
but we saw switches that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had their own</font>

466
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,170
characteristic and switch patterns that

467
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:40,340
had their own characteristic in lots of

468
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:41,870
ways so I I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't deny that load</font>

469
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:45,649
balancing could be contributing to quite

470
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,760
a bit of it but there's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

471
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,460
clear there's probably something else at

472
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:52,730
work as well I can I can save up for our

473
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:56,540
data we're not likely to see these these

474
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:58,580
things because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the low resolution so</font>

475
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,970
for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at I saw I</font>

476
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,040
saw definitely saw bgp events for all

477
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,380
the switch events so there's a strong

478
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,659
correlation there but I

479
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:16,840
and to the scientific bit that Peter did

480
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:18,700
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it Daniel bill I think that's Daniel</font>

481
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:23,919
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hard to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so far</font>

482
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:26,830
away my question actually did sort of

483
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,650
crop up I guess with Peters data when I

484
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:33,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked your cohort Peter earlier this</font>

485
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:35,670
year about the influence of igp events

486
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:39,070
because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> placement of your</font>

487
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,560
collectors you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> both inside an ISP</font>

488
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,810
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's I GP events are visible or</font>

489
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:47,679
more visible than say the ripe nodes

490
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:51,610
which tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think see more BGP type</font>

491
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:55,300
events and filter those out can you

492
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:58,300
extrapolate out<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP type of events</font>

493
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:03,610
whether it's is is or ospf or ibgp from

494
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:08,139
the ebgp or<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop ebgp kinds of</font>

495
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:12,820
events ah right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now no because we don't</font>

496
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:14,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">have we don't have or we do have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

497
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,590
ebgp feeds from lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these places but</font>

498
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:19,420
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ibgp feeds or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

499
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,429
feet so we're not we don't have enough

500
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,950
sort of data to start presuming about

501
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:26,800
these things I'll tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are again</font>

502
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,540
the boat we had both rampant speculation

503
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,399
but it was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subject of ongoing</font>

504
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,320
investigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort</font>

505
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,690
of hubris we re really are we've

506
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">contacted a few of the hosts a few of</font>

507
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,250
the a esas that were representative in

508
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,820
particular ways of various types of

509
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:45,880
instability that we saw and we're

510
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,500
essentially asking to build up if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

511
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,790
build a box and they just plug it into

512
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,920
their network so we can slurp their

513
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,620
feeds to try and figure out exactly

514
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:57,000
whether whether it's for this kind it is

515
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,500
I GP or how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

516
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,640
that's an interesting thing and it will

517
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,680
cost you lots of money if you want to

518
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,390
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my network to do debit anyone</font>

519
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,570
right but so so that's why we're asking

520
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:11,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">very politely and promising not to not</font>

521
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:13,049
to her not to unduly expose data not

522
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">misbehave and</font>

523
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:18,869
yes so this isn't a DNS thing even

524
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,509
though we're picking on DNS servers is

525
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:23,279
we're kind of a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a routing</font>

526
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,929
thing but we're picking on vgp because

527
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,239
we really don't know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

528
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:29,159
shooting at sore take my opinion target

529
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:31,590
we use DNS to measure routing effects

530
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,299
and we're picking on DNA and we're

531
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,949
picking on bgp because we really don't

532
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,739
have visibility into other routing

533
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:41,669
constructs exactly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

534
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:44,129
to get it may not be bgp but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if</font>

535
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:46,139
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if people want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help with</font>

536
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:51,830
finding fighting the ibgp side you'll

537
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:54,539
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pete oh yeah please Bruce Campbell</font>

538
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,428
one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be interesting from</font>

539
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:59,940
both studies is to find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

540
00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:03,119
so-called safe distance would be for an

541
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">anycast thing you know how many hops</font>

542
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:10,320
away before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start seeing severe</font>

543
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:13,799
flapping or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in terms of</font>

544
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,139
deploying it sort of minimum safe

545
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:19,980
distance from her nes minimum safety

546
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:24,840
sensors but yeah that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sort of</font>

547
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:29,460
max maximum see maximus a right yeah cuz

548
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:33,779
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would but yeah it's I so</font>

549
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,909
intuitively that's visual thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm</font>

550
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:37,499
not sure you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there</font>

551
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:40,590
intuitively its maximum safety

552
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:43,499
intuitively you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

553
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:46,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you're probably pretty good after</font>

554
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:50,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">that things get harder nice um but but i</font>

555
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:52,559
will say that that is game yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i agree</font>

556
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be pretty cool yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fran and</font>

557
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,249
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> other comment is that the difference</font>

558
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the two data sets does seem to</font>

559
00:28:56,249 --> 00:29:00,690
be geographical in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a European</font>

560
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,609
data set in air and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the US</font>

561
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,100
data set right and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing is</font>

562
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:06,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">that what we saw was that that's</font>

563
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,189
probably why planetlab was seen to be

564
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:10,590
more stable as well because much like

565
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:13,830
how the right points are self selected

566
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,238
for people being you know wanting to

567
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,980
donate their data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

568
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:18,570
probably caring about this kind of thing

569
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,490
may be running a tighter

570
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,759
or something I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but also</font>

571
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,100
people planetlab sort of has the same

572
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,889
self-selection issue which makes its

573
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,799
wrapping situation look more much better

574
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:34,408
and much more stable I think hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patrick</font>

575
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">El Morocco I don't know if you mentioned</font>

576
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:37,409
this in the presentation I don't

577
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:40,440
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when you see a switch did</font>

578
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:43,259
you see a change in the path length is

579
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,330
there any correlation I didn't I didn't

580
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,220
check that out so I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

581
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,000
probably won't since everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers</font>

582
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ever really but it might be</font>

583
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay intuitively</font>

584
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:58,379
so on the examples I looked at it's more

585
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,789
often than not the path links were the

586
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:04,559
same but it's not I haven't counted them

587
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:07,889
all so I don't haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done the rigorous</font>

588
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,570
thing on the maximum safe distance thing

589
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,908
obviously yeah it's not a deployment

590
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,799
guide line that's like asking how old do

591
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:16,830
people get or some things might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

592
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:20,460
useful personal bit of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

593
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:22,678
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be nice to have that as a</font>

594
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,200
closure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feedback loop for the</font>

595
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,590
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are deploying these so that</font>

596
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,519
we can see whether changes were making

597
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:35,129
our for the better or right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

598
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,139
if you deploy to to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast roots and</font>

599
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:39,830
that are too close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other maybe</font>

600
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:44,340
you're seeing effects and no more like

601
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:46,649
if we put more work into centralization

602
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,629
that is fewer nodes but more robust does

603
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that help or if we put more work into</font>

604
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:53,549
decentralization that is more nodes that

605
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,529
are closer to people does that help more

606
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:58,289
right and but again remember I mean this

607
00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:01,679
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all contingent on deploying</font>

608
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:03,120
wanting to deploy stateful services over

609
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,019
the anycast because there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

610
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,860
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of problems with UDP so but yes that</font>

611
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:09,860
would be good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look into</font>

612
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:17,470
all right sad we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done I think we're</font>

613
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">done I think we're done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cheers</font>
