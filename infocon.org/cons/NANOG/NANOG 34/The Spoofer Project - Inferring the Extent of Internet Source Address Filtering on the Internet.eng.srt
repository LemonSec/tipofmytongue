7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,189
aware of spoofing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,439
just a couple minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about it</font>

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,990
briefly in order to motivate the work

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,869
that we're doing here so obviously

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,269
spoofing is the process of a host<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,700
forges parts of the headers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,570
packets in order to do something usually

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,980
for a malicious purpose so why do i do

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,480
attackers or compromised hosts or people

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,968
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do this so the first reason of</font>

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,390
course is anonymity in order for the

18
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">host to hide behind a spoof source</font>

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,309
address there's also more sophisticated

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,680
attacks that people can employ for

21
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance the reflector attacks that</font>

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,989
string of high-profile spoofing based

26

dos attacks particularly like in

27

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,140
still goes on even in 2004 so a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,430
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were back essentially at school</font>

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,530
thinking about architectural level

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,509
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up with this question of</font>

37
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,939
like well in essence<font color="#CCCCCC"> does spoofing even</font>

38
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,430
matter in 2005 right is this still a

39
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,048
relevant interesting problem should we

40
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,689
even consider whether this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture or not so the sort</font>

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,250
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know devil's advocate</font>

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,929
is all ISPs do filtering right so they

44
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,250
do RFC 28 27 or unicast RPF the second

45
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,979
reason it may not matter is because a

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,630
lot of these attackers these days are

47
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,729
relying on huge zombie farms that

48
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,039
provide little additional anonymity when

49
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,479
you actually do spoofing and then the

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">third reason of course is the prevalence</font>

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,869
of gnats as we've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font>

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,049
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the headers are rewritten and</font>

53
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,848
so it essentially makes spoofing useless

54
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,349
however when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at these network</font>

55
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,420
telescopes that people have installed

56
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:15,119
around parts of the internet we

57
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,750
the continued strong spoofing activity

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,370
as recently as 2004 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know people at</font>

59

62
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,738
spoofs is an operationally difficult

63
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,850
problem there was a talk at nana<font color="#CCCCCC"> auger a</font>

up with proposals for icmp trace backs

67
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,080
other researchers have looked at things

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,970
like hash based IP trace back all these

69
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">are designed in essence in order to</font>

70
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,299
track where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> source of these spoof</font>

71

packets are so in order to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

72
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:56,940
answer the question of well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

73
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,560

<font color="#E5E5E5">wide act of measurement project where</font>

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,010
we'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> quantify the extent in</font>

79

nature of source address filtering on

project website the again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

82
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,510
quite simple clients simply run a

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,370
spoofer binary we also have source

84
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,190
available and many of you have may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

85
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,040
seen my advertisement to<font color="#E5E5E5"> various mailing</font>

86
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,790

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,790
firewall mailing lists etc I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

88
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,340
get to all that in a bit so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

89
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,828
here is that the client sends a series

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,290
of spoofed UDP packets and it sends five

91
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:42,660
of each type the type of UDP packet we

92
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,250
send is we specifically craft them in

93
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,290
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out and to infer</font>

94
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,750
specific ISP policies I'll get into that

95
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,280
in just a few slides and we use in a

96
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,040
random inner packet delay between

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,590
packets in order to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mitigate any</font>

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,660
effects that might occur from from

99
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,260
normal loss of UDP packets in the

100
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,540
network each packet contains a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 14 bite</font>

101
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,328
identifier which uniquely identifies it

102
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,370
and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these packets go to a server</font>

103
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sits on our campus as they received</font>

104
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:15,090
the packets are thrown into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a database</font>

105
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,649
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client finishes sourcing all</font>

106
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,209
of these spoofed packets it runs a

107
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,000
traceroute to our server this lets us

108
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,079
know actually the forward path that the

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,030
spoofed<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIMPAC</font>

110
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">traverse in order to get to our server</font>

111
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,020
and then it establishes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp connection</font>

112
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,870
that reports this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracer out and it</font>

113
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,609
sends essentially a summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all the</font>

114
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,270
different packets that it attempted to

115
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,879
send in the course of doing spoofing<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

116
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,370
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do do we use UDP port 53</font>

117
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,500
which is obviously DNS this lets us

118
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,210
hopefully get around any secondary

119
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,539
filtering effects that people might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

120
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,318
in place usually DNS can get through we

121
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:54,539
use port 80 for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP connection and</font>

122
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:57,060
again this is to his most accurate view

123
00:04:54,539 --> 00:05:00,090
as possible so the identifiers that are

124
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,710
in each of these packets allow us to

125
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,719
disambiguate which<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's made it through</font>

126
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the analysis and the web pages are</font>

127
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:08,159
driven off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these this database so I</font>

128
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,530
alluded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that we send a</font>

129
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:12,300
series of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> spoof packets and we</font>

130
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,669
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this in a somewhat intelligent</font>

131
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,789
fashion so the first three that you see

132
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,549
here the first one is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a a bogan</font>

133
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,960
address which is means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a</font>

134
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,930
legitimate address but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually</font>

135
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,479
existing in the global BGP tables the

136
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,029
second address is a valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> address in the</font>

137
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,789
BGP tables except it exists it belongs

138
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:35,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to another organization the third one is</font>

139
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:37,229
an RFC 1918 private address which of

140
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:40,069
course is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be routable or</font>

141
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,810
to traverse organizational boundaries

142
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,460
the the last one here is the neighbor

143
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,610
spoofing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go into in more</font>

145
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,159
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of a client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run and I'll go</font>

146
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">on to some results because this is</font>

147
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:58,319
perhaps the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting part of my</font>

148
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:59,580
whole talk so from march two thousand

149
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,740
five which is approximately when we

150
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,500
announced this thing we got about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 570</font>

151
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,889
client reports of those about 440 were

152
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,810
unique and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,690
believed unspookable portions of the

155
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,449
network I'm actually talking about

156
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,310
portions of the network from from which

157
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,740
we did receive reports but we see no

158
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,779
corroborating evidence that spoofing

159
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,639
exists we use the University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Oregon</font>

perfect size and asses do all the

162
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,289
mapping and I should note that we do

163
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,139
exclude a number of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> classes of</font>

00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,699
or something like that we saw 19 of

those and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

177
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,199
it through but obviously the spoofing

178
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,180
had no effect so in sum total

179
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,979
approximately two-thirds of the client

180
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,340

pretty pie charts which may or may not

these where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see that one of</font>

extrapolate that out to the entire

207

208
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,539
a reasonable assumption or not I

209

probably won't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and just talk though so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the as i said</font>

211
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,729
we send a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different packets</font>

212
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,760
try to infer the policies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

213
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:29,460
place so it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy for an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

214
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,338
for instance simply block all the RFC

215
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,289
1918 this is a static policy it's never

216
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,539
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and it's fairly easy to</font>

217
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,699
administer there's also as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

218
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,919
of you are aware other automated methods

219
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,550
for doing various filtering for instance

220
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,250
some providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> may only allow packets to</font>

221
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,599
be sent or routed if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

222
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,149
corresponding

223
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,890
valid BGP route for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that source or for</font>

224
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:58,060
instance the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bogue on route server</font>

225
00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:00,189
project from Rob Thomas and his crew so

226
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,290
here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table that tries to capture</font>

227
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,010
this this notion of the frequency of

228
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:08,800
inconsistent filtering so we see that

229
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:12,339
for instance there's 17 of the sessions

230
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,979
where the valid address was not filtered

231
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:17,589
but the bogans in RFC 1918 work and we

232
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,959
see an even larger number where bogans

233
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:22,300
and ballads made it through but RFC 1918

234
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:27,339
did not and so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an instance</font>

235
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:29,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a very specific policy so again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

236
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,029
looted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this this web page this is I</font>

237
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,860
hope you'll take at least a quick look

238
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,510
at it this tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to summarize the</font>

239
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,160
current state of IP spoofing as we've

240
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,800
seen it so of course our goal is to

241
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue collecting reports in order to</font>

242
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,140
improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> our accuracy to get a wider view</font>

243
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,209
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also to detect trends</font>

244
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,279
so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we need operator help to</font>

245
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,800
expand coverage and and gain more data

246
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,860
here's a quick view of what that page

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,510
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go to it on your own</font>

248
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I also talked about this notion of</font>

249
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,220
the neighbor spoof that our test does so

250
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,510
in general as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might expect you're</font>

251
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,100
probably always going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

252
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,779
spoof your<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe immediate neighbor</font>

253
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,480
ip-address<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your address</font>

254
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">plus or minus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one there it's usually not</font>

255
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,500
a problem the exception of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course being</font>

256
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,319
on some cable modem head ends and things

257
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,120
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so the idea here was to</font>

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,470
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what granularity</font>

259
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,029
policy you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is applied by ISPs so</font>

260
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,970
what we do is we try successive

261
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:27,160
successively larger boundaries we start

262
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,620
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a / 31 which is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to correspond</font>

263
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,380
to your immediate neighbor go to / 30

264
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,350
and go all the way up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the /a to see</font>

265
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,720
at what at what granularity policy is

266
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,220
applied and this summarizes this is the

267
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,560
probability distribution of the

268
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,839
filtering granularity we see spikes as

269
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,819
we might expect at some of the classical

270
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,790
boundaries so for instance we see a lot

271
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:52,690
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are applying their filters on</font>

272
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:55,540
/<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24s and / AIT's a full forty percent</font>

273
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,980
are on the / 8 which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is indicative of</font>

274
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,750
the fact that if you're intelligent

275
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,450
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your spoofing you can probably do</font>

276
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,470
a fair amount

277
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:07,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">damage so the last thing I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

278
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">show was a visualization actually of</font>

279
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,700
looking at the spoofing what I'm going

280
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to call the spoofing perimeter so the</font>

281
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea here is that you know all this data</font>

282
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and tables is nice and all but it would</font>

283
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,280
be even<font color="#CCCCCC"> better if we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

284
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,830
reasonable idea of what the geographic

285
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,020
spread or what this sort of extent of

286
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,320
the of this crucible portion of the

287
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:31,230
network was so what we wanted to do was

288
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,570
to overlay<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spoof abul portion of the</font>

289
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,730
network on top of the amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

290
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,140
network that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we observed from all of our</font>

291
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,670
different clients so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use one of</font>

292
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">katie's tools it's a called otter from</font>

293
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:47,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bradley huffaker to build the a s graph</font>

294
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:49,110
and each node actually on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph</font>

295
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,150
corresponds to the a s for which the

296
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,550
client belongs to and then we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

297
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,160
nodes for all of the asses along the

298
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,050
path from that client to our server each

299
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,850
edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course is defined by the a s</font>

300
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,920
path and we use a semi geographic

301
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,410
coordinate system again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

302
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,420
to the the skitter a escapology graphs

303
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,219
you may have seen from kata our server

304
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,020
is actually at the center of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this graph</font>

305
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:16,430
it's the root and the AS hop distance is

306
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:19,650
represented by the radius of each node

307
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:23,160
finally the node degree represents the

308
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:25,949
longitude of the a s of the organization

309
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,620
of a s4 which the client belong to so

310
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:31,320
here's a picture this sort of looks like

311
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,620
soup here but again at the center<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our</font>

312
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,500
server the one portion up to the right I

313
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,210
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US the other is Europe</font>

314
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,550
and we have Asia sitting over here and

315
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we overlay that with the portion of</font>

316
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:48,329
the network that's suitable we can get

317
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:50,819
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool visualizations and so</font>

318
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,610
I think amount of time so I'll wrap up

319
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that and take any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions you</font>

320
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,759
might have

321
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,758
oh ok thanks
