00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay my name is Anya Pittman I'm from</font>

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:06,480
the technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> university in Munich</font>

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,879
Germany and what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about</font>

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">today is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the kind of a nicer</font>

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,760
way of abstracting and kind of

6
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:21,390
representing and realizing a Squatch

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,730
routing policies for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP routing so</font>

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,050
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes back to some of the</font>

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,769
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,869
here today or yesterday that a lot of

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,000
people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing filtering and if</font>

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,100
you leave out one session then you screw

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,680
up all of your filtering and what is a

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,890
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around and doing</font>

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,950
some of these things in a right way so

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,410
let's get moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> with kind of just</font>

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,410
briefly reviewing what do I mean with a

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,769
routing policy here so in some sense if

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,269
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your a is over here then really</font>

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,930
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing policy all about</font>

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,879
well it is all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what woods should</font>

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,879
you actually accept here and you should

23
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,280
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that you don't accept</font>

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,679
routes that you shouldn't be accepting

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,220
and then you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manipulate</font>

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,220
them then they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sent out then</font>

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,200
again manipulated them and then you need

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,439
to decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> which routes you actually want</font>

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to set out and all of this the way that</font>

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,699
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> done for all of the various</font>

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,250
different bgp sessions is what your

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,840
routing policy is now the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,670
the way that routing policies are

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,070
currently handed in my view at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,090
I'll that they are unfortunately often

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,149
is specified because think about it if

37
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,640
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operating a network well do you</font>

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">have your documentation is it in all of</font>

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,360
the various different bgp statements

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,479
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outer on your reuters a</font>

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,100
div is to actually write them down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that that is one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> major</font>

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,280
problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root policy is ill</font>

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,339
specified and really the database is a

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,689
network itself and then you have some

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,820
kind of a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one of your</font>

47
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,380
customer links you go in to manipulate

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,898
it and suddenly the routing policy

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,720
changed again a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things our</font>

50
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,090
customers

51
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,700
you have to go about think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

52
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,220
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP statements to tweak in order</font>

53
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out ah this is how I do</font>

54
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,130
various different aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it now the</font>

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,660
goal of this work here is that we get

56
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,760
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the manual</font>

57
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,820
configurations here and actually go

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,850
about in being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of take</font>

59
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,070
apart the AS<font color="#CCCCCC"> Byatt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routing policy into</font>

60
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,109
various different pieces so that we on

61
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,239
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> racing abstraction level</font>

62
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,490
but on the other hand you are still able

63
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually automatically generate all</font>

64
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,080
of the different pieces of the

65
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,970
configurations for not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one word a</font>

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendor that actually multiple out the</font>

67
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,130
windows and this is what I'm going to

68
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,890
talk about today so what do I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

69
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,780
wooden policy and I have some various

70
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,149
different examples that actually

71
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,520
contribute to a routing policy what are

72
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,980
they well on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand you need to</font>

73
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,690
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you actually wanna all of</font>

74
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,299
your business<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship which means</font>

75
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to peering right then you</font>

76
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,900
probably want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that you have</font>

77
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,730
to write kind of preferences set so that

78
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,610
the customer odds are preferred over the

79
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,950
peering rods it's at her but there's

80
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,170
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a trend going on which</font>

81
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,570
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> btp policy has gotten</font>

82
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,910
quite a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more complicated and that is</font>

83
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,160
some of the peering customers transit

84
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,769
customers actually do want some amount

85
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,630
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> control about a routing and actually</font>

86
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:35,290
that's possible that's what all of this

87
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,000
community hands on is all about so that

88
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,820
you can actually give some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,440
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the traffic engineering to</font>

90
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,329
each one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers we've seen</font>

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,680
that earlier today when we were talking

92
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the ipv6 would you humming and</font>

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,610
then there are additional services and

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,530
that is maybe you want to be able to

95
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,530
actually do some black holing in order

96
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,600
to get around adidas attacked IP address

97
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,150
but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course they are promised that</font>

98
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,000
because really what you have if you have

99
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">new customers that want all of this you</font>

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to kind of see arm this is what is</font>

101
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,120
customized man maybe not just one maybe

102
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,730
this one and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

103
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,220
everybody has have so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

104
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,488
have is that the policy doesn't just

105
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,180
consists of one statement of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP sets</font>

106
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,690
but if we

107
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:26,350
is a set of policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should apply</font>

108
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:29,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">network-wide like but bogan filtering</font>

109
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,539
Martian<font color="#E5E5E5"> theaters earnings etc and then</font>

110
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,429
you have some maybe value<font color="#CCCCCC"> you added</font>

111
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,919
services or maybe services that

112
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,620
everybody is supposed to have so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,070
the routing policy is a set of policies

114
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:44,410
and services so let's take an example

115
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,370
and let's think about how some of these

116
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,710
services are actually realized so let's

117
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">look a black hole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or do you might want</font>

118
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,638
to do it whether it all comes down to

119
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,500
the point that you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

120
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,840
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of your trigger in order to</font>

121
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">say okay now I want to black hole all of</font>

122
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,099
the traffic for this specific IP address

123
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,880
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it well you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

124
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:08,500
community as a trigger then on the

125
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">rooters you actually rewrite the next</font>

126
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,030
hop so that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the traffic is</font>

127
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">dropped to the death knell interface but</font>

128
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,479
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course you don't want</font>

129
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,789
to allow everybody to do that because

130
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">otherwise you have a nice new details at</font>

131
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:23,010
hacky so you actually want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font>

132
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,360
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

133
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,669
authorization here and you also want to

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,060
deploy some other safeguard here which

135
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:33,490
is were no expert so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it realized</font>

136
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,979
what they are various different steps to

137
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,229
it you want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

138
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:40,330
ingress you actually allow this black

139
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:42,699
hole community only for the specific

140
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,710
customers that actually are supposed to

141
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,630
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you also want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

142
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,270
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> root for which it's being used</font>

143
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,820
are only the ones that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in</font>

144
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,340
the authorized set then you need to be

145
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,310
able to rewrite the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hop and you</font>

146
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,560
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you actually</font>

147
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,169
don't advertise this row to any further

148
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,570
so on egress you have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

149
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:09,400
you do featuring of all of these black

150
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:12,789
holes so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it what I mean with an</font>

151
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,520
atomic unit of a BGP policy or a service

152
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:18,550
here so willing what you want to be able

153
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,250
to do is probably say for this specific

154
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,130
set of BGP sessions that I actually want

155
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to identify in some kind of a network</font>

156
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,510
specific independent way but let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

157
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:32,630
ah those are the one sessions at

158
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:35,750
after service selected we all that have

159
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,850
or appeals all those that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font>

160
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I basically want to be able to</font>

161
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,350
select them but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to do</font>

162
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,919
this in some kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor</font>

163
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">independent cut of a boy and then once I</font>

164
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,540
have identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set I actually do</font>

165
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,330
want to apply some kind of a fair trade

166
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,480
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> future do I mean where you may want</font>

167
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,820
to say is this really the community

168
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,670
being said here or is this part of a

169
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:05,060
specific asset or is it part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

170
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:07,580
specific prefix here now if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

171
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply this video that is again vendor</font>

172
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,979
specific you can't apply for the spinner

173
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,690
independently and then you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

174
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,210
some actions let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we write</font>

175
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,640
parameters like what we just had where

176
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,280
we wanted to rewrite the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hop or add</font>

177
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and this is again</font>

178
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,400
vendor specific so one of the questions

179
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,680
that we were asking ourself is how can

180
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">we split this wing vendor-independent</font>

181
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,670
part from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor specific pieces</font>

182
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,250
down here and the way that we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

183
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:43,850
slice and dice the soil problem of BGP

184
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,920
configuration is to say let's take the

185
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,010
elements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are network specific and</font>

186
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,470
put them into an LED fog database here

187
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,300
so we have a network module which

188
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,670
contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the description of our various</font>

189
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,680
different network elements and then we

190
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,290
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help her policy and service</font>

191
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,660
module which basically takes the

192
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,640
abstract definitions of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

193
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,640
different individual routing policies

194
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,280
and services and this can be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in</font>

195
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,650
a way that is completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

196
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,320
independent and vendor-independent and

197
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:18,979
then we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have can't of course</font>

198
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">will as any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this without any specific</font>

199
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of her Brenda treatment and so we</font>

200
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,059
needed to have kind of a library<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

201
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:29,420
vendor specific code fragments that can

202
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,610
then be combined to actually realize the

203
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,729
set of policies to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for specific</font>

204
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,220
sessions and all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

205
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,440
then accomplished via a<font color="#E5E5E5"> configurator</font>

206
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,490
which takes these various different

207
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,250
databases

208
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,320
imports and then produces various

209
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,589
different pieces of configuration

210
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,950
convicted or actually produces<font color="#E5E5E5"> our psl</font>

211
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:54,709
now you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask why didn't we</font>

212
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">just use up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here cell and the main</font>

213
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:59,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason for that is that what we are</font>

214
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,500
doing here is actually adding another

215
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,410
layer of abstraction on top of the kind

216
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">of wave capabilities that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> psl has</font>

217
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:13,819
because really what we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

218
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,700
to do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of separate the</font>

219
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,220
process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP configuration into the</font>

220
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,860
various different steps that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

221
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,130
by different people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the network</font>

222
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,550
module that can be maintained by the

223
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,120
staff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually responsible for</font>

224
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:35,089
selling our and configuring the network

225
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,310
you don't need a BGP expert for that the

226
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">BTB expert should be able to kind of set</font>

227
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,890
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device different policies and</font>

228
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,410
services here and maybe help us actually

229
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,230
putting together the configured road

230
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,240
that is being stored over here but they

231
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,700
should not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in actually doing</font>

232
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,310
the day-to-day kind of maintenance of

233
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,500
the various different sessions and so

234
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,839
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why we choose this let's</font>

235
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,209
actually go in and kind of get<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from</font>

236
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,339
this high<font color="#CCCCCC"> level description into a more</font>

237
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,949
concrete description so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

238
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,410
look at the network module one by one

239
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,660
and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

240
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,360
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to capture the current state of</font>

241
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the current service</font>

242
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,120
subscriptions and so the elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

243
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are Rooter beauties</font>

244
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,240
neighbor session and services now why do

245
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,370
we have our neighbor<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercession here</font>

246
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,589
well most of the peering sessions most

247
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,350
of the customers are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized we are</font>

248
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:35,870
a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> EGP session but actually we are</font>

249
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,910
multiple ones that usually have the same

250
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of characteristics and you want to</font>

251
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to that to kind of formulate</font>

252
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,750
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the same kind of</font>

253
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:48,010
policy on every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these sessions</font>

254
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:51,610
and so that's why was the b2b neighbor

255
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,230
and set policies for all of them so how

256
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,230
does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like let's say we have a</font>

257
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:59,260
Rooter but just being<font color="#E5E5E5"> our houses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

258
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:02,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">name loopback IP address is located in a</font>

259
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,970
different city and has a certain system

260
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,719
specification for example in this case

261
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:09,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">or June OS was a specific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ions on OS</font>

262
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,890
version here now why do we need this

263
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about the location but</font>

264
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,180
because maybe you want to actually

265
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:18,220
tagged any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a word</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been</font>

266
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,620
originated from this route are busy

267
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,140
location information that it comes from

268
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the region you are almost specifically</font>

269
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Germany and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where you can get</font>

270
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,470
this kind of information for later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

271
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:37,300
now a b2b<font color="#E5E5E5"> naval is being set up over</font>

272
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:39,010
here which has certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> labor is so this</font>

273
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,130
is then being used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually generate</font>

274
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,140
the BGP statements one then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font>

275
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,750
certain Ava type that can be used to

276
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,660
finally figure out how to realize the

277
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,120
BGP peering policy and then you have a

278
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,640
set of sessions that is associated visit

279
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,160
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one and here we have</font>

280
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,220
Fletcher import and export statements

281
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,130
now these<font color="#CCCCCC"> feet are important export</font>

282
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,320
statements are being not realized by the

283
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">system itself but here we take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage</font>

284
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,170
of the fact that will see existing

285
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,720
databases and<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself we have a</font>

286
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,630
nice way of manipulating filters so we

287
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,000
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this and it also</font>

288
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives us the ability with access to the</font>

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">data bases here that if you put our</font>

290
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,770
changes you don't have to go about and

291
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the configuration here but</font>

292
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:33,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually you just as a customer can or</font>

293
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:35,800
change your element in the database and

294
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">then this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is being picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and updated</font>

295
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,339
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rooters automatically at some</font>

296
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:46,480
later point how does the session look

297
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:50,050
like well you have over here your name

298
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,750
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being referenced above</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

299
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,000
the location on which rather it is you

300
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the remote address and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,889
have a set of services over here which

302
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,869
may apply

303
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:04,249
to the session over here now you have

304
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:07,369
services that can be specified on the

305
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:09,259
neighbor or you can have it on the

306
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,540
session now if it's something is

307
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:13,790
specified on the neighbor<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is then</font>

308
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,790
it is automatically inherited by all of

309
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,519
the sessions alternatively it can be

310
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,790
overwritten and you can have the ability

311
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,009
to kind of say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's say we want to</font>

312
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,319
actually half a specific lid over here

313
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:30,019
and for those worlds for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which this</font>

314
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:32,899
video applies we want to set in net

315
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,989
value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 for a different theater a</font>

316
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,939
different Matt value and a different

317
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:42,290
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a default value if none of these</font>

318
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:44,238
filters over here actually applies now

319
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,309
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know how a network is</font>

320
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:48,889
being specified we can go about and

321
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:52,009
actually worried about our policy so

322
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,410
what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say about the task here well</font>

323
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,749
what we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have is some kind</font>

324
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,389
of an abstraction so that we can express

325
00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:01,669
the policy what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do when we say a</font>

326
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,379
policy what you usually mean with the

327
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:05,540
policy is actually that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

328
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,999
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> the session set and then we want</font>

329
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,169
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply certain vgp operations on them</font>

330
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:14,839
and so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the kind of</font>

331
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:16,069
elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have support for in</font>

332
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of a data basically</font>

333
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:21,769
description that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are proposing here</font>

334
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:24,889
so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two top level elements policy</font>

335
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:27,439
and services and here's an example of

336
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,839
how such a service could actually look

337
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:33,860
like and the service that we have here

338
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,110
is black hole so what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say when we</font>

339
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,839
were kind of looking at the service we

340
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,759
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want to have an</font>

341
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,709
authorization here and so one of the

342
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,929
things is you have a parameter here

343
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:46,969
which is a black hole set for which you

344
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:50,660
can this is the kind of data that

345
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:53,119
restricts you on to the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prefixes</font>

346
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,219
for which you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply this so</font>

347
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:57,319
this could for example and tell all of

348
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,859
the more specifics of the world said

349
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:03,069
that that Kozma may actually have or be

350
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:06,439
defined in some other kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a break</font>

351
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:08,719
then for all of the English direction

352
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,310
over here you want to be able to kind of

353
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,740
say if this

354
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,810
customer or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spear has actually</font>

355
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,790
subscribed to the service black hole

356
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,979
that's the condition that we have over

357
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you actually want to be able</font>

358
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,920
to perform a check for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the black hole</font>

359
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,170
community and if so then you actually

360
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,110
want to realize the black hole service

361
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,209
and for that we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using two different</font>

362
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,180
fragments over here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

363
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:38,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize the necessary bgp filtering and</font>

364
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,479
the necessary bgp manipulations here if

365
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,420
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service over</font>

366
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,100
here is being sent then just think that

367
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,349
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is actually figure out</font>

368
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,110
any world that might have this black

369
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,510
hole community said and this is why we

370
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this apartment over here which says</font>

371
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,400
ingress<font color="#E5E5E5"> Blackwell community deny which</font>

372
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,959
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this world will not be</font>

373
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,930
accepted now there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more thing to</font>

374
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,570
point out and that is this service black

375
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,729
hole over here was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually kind of</font>

376
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,529
conditioned on the fact that the service

377
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">black hole was actually booked by</font>

378
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,510
somebody of course you have other kind

379
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sell policies that you want to</font>

380
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,500
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

381
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,300
distinction that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> making up here</font>

382
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,810
when we are talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> end force</font>

383
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,390
policy which could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or Martian</font>

384
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,989
pooja or<font color="#CCCCCC"> bogan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> builder which will be</font>

385
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:34,370
well as automatically for all sessions

386
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,470
independent of what the subscription

387
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,810
model would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you have the</font>

388
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,930
available services which can be booked

389
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:46,969
and specified on a per session or<font color="#E5E5E5"> foyer</font>

390
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:49,430
neighbor basis now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this of course</font>

391
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,680
depends on the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a way</font>

392
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,140
to actually realize the various

393
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,209
different bgp operations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a</font>

394
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,459
task of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background model which</font>

395
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:01,910
actually calculates the vendor specific

396
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:04,188
elements and such provides kind of just

397
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:07,189
a list of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> aim fragments which</font>

398
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:09,470
can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually realize the</font>

399
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:14,270
various different services and policies

400
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:17,060
and so how do we do this well we have

401
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically another kind of a database</font>

402
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,970
which contains these and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

403
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">order to then customize</font>

404
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,429
any of the various<font color="#E5E5E5"> different statements</font>

405
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,590
you have to be able to cross-reference

406
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:30,480
goes into the policy model as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

407
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,370
into the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> model in order to</font>

408
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what are the specific values</font>

409
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,379
to be used and since this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fairly</font>

410
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,080
abstract let's look at an example again

411
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it do</font>

412
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,030
it's for cisco iOS and it actually

413
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,270
filters out the black hole community

414
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:51,210
here so what do we do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a part</font>

415
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:53,370
over here which actually sets the

416
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,280
neighbor statement over here based on

417
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,639
the remote IP address and the world map

418
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:02,580
route map in now the road map itself of

419
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,799
course has to have certain elements

420
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,559
which are being highlighted here so you

421
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to put it in some kind of a</font>

422
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship then you have to cut a</font>

423
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:15,240
filter on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> black hole set match the</font>

424
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:18,450
community set the next help IP address

425
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,770
over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then set the community no</font>

426
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:25,260
export now there are various<font color="#E5E5E5"> is specific</font>

427
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,750
elements over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here one is a road map</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">then combine the route maps into the</font>

431
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,580
fragments into the right kind of

432
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,460
priority order so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of</font>

433
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:44,100
prioritization the thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind</font>

434
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:48,030
here is that this system doesn't take

435
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,549
away the need to think about in what

436
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,620
order do we actually apply the various

437
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,900
different b2b statements but it helps

438
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,020
you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to do this once and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

439
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,940
have to redo<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for every single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PL for</font>

440
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,950
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> session that you have to</font>

441
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:07,260
set up now the continued means that this

442
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,600
is not a final decision so this wouldn't

443
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,610
be a denial or<font color="#E5E5E5"> final accept but that</font>

444
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,340
maybe you want to do some education and

445
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,469
manipulations here you of course also

446
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,320
may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some kind of theater</font>

447
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,480
here and again we are taking advantage

448
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the fact that these photos can</font>

actually be paralyzed<font color="#E5E5E5"> param planetary</font>

450
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,260
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the community</font>

451
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,420

452
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:35,030
constructed via an external database and

453
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,550
so you can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> change those values if</font>

454
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,860
you wanted to now of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've</font>

455
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,470
shown you over here was only the part

456
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,449
for the cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS but for juniors we</font>

457
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:49,130
have a similar version as well as for

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:51,850
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl and it's easily possible to</font>

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:55,940
expand this for other would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enders</font>

460
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:57,919
now once you have all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

generate the conflicted parts that can

you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP statement for this</font>

495
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,800
that cisco iOS well then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

496
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,040
have to combine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various different</font>

497
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:34,129
pieces so that what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have here well</font>

498
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,129
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first hand we have a Martian</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">swelter</font>

500
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,570
the next one over here checks what are

00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,880
the woods whether you actually have the

authorization for the black hole or not

503
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,240
if not then it may actually be rejected

504
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,950
and only if you have it then you can

505
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually set the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community and three</font>

to keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind that this is only a</font>

small<font color="#E5E5E5"> subset and example over here and</font>

509
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,320
the same kind of output can be generated

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:09,720
not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Cisco but for juniors and</font>

511
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:12,419
obviously itself too so what do I think

512
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the benefits of a system like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this are I</font>

513
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the benefits are that we can</font>

514
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,380
actually now have an explicit

515
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,320
specification of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing policy and</font>

516
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,780
it isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brew</font>

517
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">token piglets anymore but it really is</font>

518
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:30,120
independent of the network itself also

519
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,940
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you gain is you gain your</font>

520
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">separation of your routing policy into</font>

521
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,020
the various different pieces so that

522
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,180
it's clear what are the additional

523
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,830
services that you offer to enable

524
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:45,720
customers or appears of transits cuz our

525
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:48,960
customers more control over their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

526
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,740
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also allows you to introduce</font>

527
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">new services fairly quickly because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

528
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,860
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a counterfeit</font>

529
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-stage manner first you most of all</font>

530
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to actually set up some preparation</font>

531
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:07,050
meeting because for example if you want

532
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,840
to do have allow prepending to specific

533
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,760
a SS<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you first need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

534
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,100
you can sell the service you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

535
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,050
prepare<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all outgoing sessions that</font>

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,990
the service is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be supported and</font>

537
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,460
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first step and once you</font>

538
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,920
have enabled it for all the outgoing

539
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:26,760
session then you can actually enable it

540
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,470
for some incoming ones and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,480
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> take advantage of new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> water</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">features because the only pieces that</font>

543
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,880
you need to change is the back end

544
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,580
module and the necessary are fragments

545
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,980
over there you also respect to knowledge

546
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:45,740
domains because you really

547
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:48,410
that one person can now focus on the

548
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,690
various different policy they don't have

549
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,480
to worry about the specific speaks of

of course you can automatically generate

the appropriate how to config let's for

this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm curious for feedback from</font>

569
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:05,540
connections using VI or whatever editor

570
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:07,580
or graphic queefing they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and</font>

571
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,950
what what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trade-off in the</font>

572
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,330
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of routers or number of</font>

573
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:16,160
configurations that you need to maintain

574
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:19,149
I if I've got two routers is this an

575
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,650
efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of my time if I've got</font>

576
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:25,450
2,000 routers as you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where's the</font>

577
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:28,340
break point well with to Reuters I

578
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:33,050
somewhat suspect that you probably will

579
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:37,459
have so simple requirements that it

580
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:40,909
doesn't justify the learning curve on

581
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:44,890
the other hand if you are doing if you

582
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:47,809
are implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like 50</font>

583
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:50,929
policy and signaling elements in the

584
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:53,740
service that you are building across 100

585
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:56,800
Reuters and you want to have the

586
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:01,090
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add another 12 over the next</font>

587
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:06,730
quarter year well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

588
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:08,500
worthwhile to consider this thank you so

589
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,390
basically it depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the complexity</font>

590
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,520
of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're right for towards</font>

591
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,990
as it's probably not it but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

592
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stay the tour route as to a hundred</font>

593
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,520
rotors you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to think about</font>

594
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,910
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an automated system to</font>

595
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:24,040
generate the config let's photos<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um</font>

596
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:27,400
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask for a straw poll how</font>

597
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:30,399
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room configure</font>

598
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:35,559
routers themselves not having somebody

599
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,600
on their staff keep your hands up how

600
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,300
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are for the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

601
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,770
would use a tool like this keep your

602
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,940
hands up if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not wouldn't use it</font>

603
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:48,220
to like this put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hands down do you</font>

604
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:54,160
guys with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your hands up have tools like</font>

605
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:55,630
this now big hum yes hmm how many people

606
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go download this code</font>

607
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:02,710
immediately<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay get those guys right</font>

608
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:07,380
there right all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right again thank you</font>

609
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much it's break time</font>
