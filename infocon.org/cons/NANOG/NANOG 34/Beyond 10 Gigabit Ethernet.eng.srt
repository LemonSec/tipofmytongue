next for us and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:23,180
go through maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> two options and the</font>

of getting the next generation is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,899
standardized and how long it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would take</font>

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:40,230
and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go through</font>

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:44,340
today if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet it is</font>

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:48,718

that history as any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of indicator</font>

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,920
100 gig is the logical choice but also

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">ethernet has been boring out of</font>

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,600
technology from other technologies like

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:16,619
gigabit is there a possible choice I the

obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pros in con the pros of 40</font>

gigabit ethernet are we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet can</font>

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,040
borrow a lot of technology firms sonnet

24
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:29,548
it can leverage of all the way of

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:34,890
efforts in terms of spy<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 and SS fire</font>

26
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:37,799
SFI 55.0 nessa 55.2 all these different

27
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,900
interfaces for framers and max we can

28
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,720
borrow all those technologies and get

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,320
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> into 40w than that and the</font>

packet processing time per packet in 40

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,839
gigabit will be on 16 or 17 nanoseconds

32
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,850
and which is kind of achievable at 90

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,159
nanometer process technology using a

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,669
second stuff so it's a bit simpler

35

<font color="#CCCCCC">long-term</font>

implement hundred gig packet processing

76
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,209
it's like six-point sound to nano

77
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,569
seconds per packet which is very very

78
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult and it takes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back data</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">packs and very very high speed memories</font>

80
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:07,319
to do the packet processing the

81
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,659
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the package editing and look</font>

82
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,119
up and cable management was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

83
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:15,689
stuff and lot of work needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in</font>

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,560
the optic side only important conscious

85
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:20,940
is very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do 100 gig chipset</font>

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,280
for packet processing and also use it

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,490
for 10 gig and be praised price

88
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,919
competitive in 10 gig purple price so

89
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,479
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the important important cons that</font>

90
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:38,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are concerned about doing 100 gig</font>

91
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:41,280
chipsets so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through</font>

92
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:44,460
what it what is it taken i triple e to

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,830
get any interface standardized this one

94
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,049
of the standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you tonight for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

95
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,169

<font color="#CCCCCC">Gigabit Ethernet took two and a half to</font>

99
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,120
happened in 2002 the most of the work

100
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,880
will happen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the study group and in</font>

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,729
the task force for 400 gig you do take a

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,340
longer time because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lord of optical</font>

103
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:15,210
work has to be done but for 40 gig e to

104
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:16,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">be it won't be that long so the most of</font>

105
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,400
the effort will happen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the study</font>

106
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:23,229
group and in the task force

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,229
a part of the standardization process

108
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,119
excuse me

109
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,799
so I think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know whatever ethernet</font>

110
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,050
whatever standard has some nathan has

111
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,629
happened ethernet has proven to be very

112
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,229
successful in the market what we think

113
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,520
is if you choose 100 gig or 40 gig the

114
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,469
Standish is in time will be good a bit

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,080
different for 40 gig one gig maybe one

116
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,960
or two years but<font color="#CCCCCC"> two by the time it gets</font>

117
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,909
mass adoption maybe 40 gig you be six

118
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,830
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now 100 you will be eight</font>

119
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:04,080
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now so basically by the time</font>

120
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,039
it becomes very reasonably cheap to take

121
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,690
eight years to get their 100 game so

122
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:15,389
maybe 40 gig maybe get a bit shorter

123
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:18,650
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I think as users of</font>

124
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:23,699
switches and routers we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will recommend</font>

125
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:27,150
the audience to basically talking start

126
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:30,479
talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a system vendors about next</font>

127
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:33,060
generation ethernet solutions and also

128
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,800
hey we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in I Triple E so</font>

129
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,599
basically you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did it or three</font>

130
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">member can start a call for interest</font>

131
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:43,590
that would drive what will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

132
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:46,969
generation of ethernet that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

133
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,969
have any questions

134
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:07,880
look yeah Tony Lee<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco so what's the</font>

135
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:09,470
big deal here doing the hundred he's not

136
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,699
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got a lot of</font>

137
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:19,130
40 gig slots already shipping the this

138
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:22,250
is not I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a lot of</font>

139
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,199
effort to<font color="#E5E5E5"> standardize things and when</font>

140
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,520
you put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort you put down to the</font>

141
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,860
right one so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to do</font>

142
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,560
it again it again last I heard this

143
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,320
community is generally very accepting of

144
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,010
things and aren't even really

145
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,599
standardized as long as it works I think

146
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,969
it's won't be cheaper if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that</font>

147
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,430
route I think to get it cheap I you need

148
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sanitize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the this stuff isn't</font>

149
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:50,180
going to be cheaper because there's not

150
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:53,240
going to be broad acceptance of vast

151
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:56,479
numbers of 40 gig and 100 gig interfaces

152
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,780
across the enterprise market space so

153
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:05,139
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking already a fairly esoteric</font>

154
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:10,070
product I cannot hear you it's esoteric

155
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:11,840
it's a niche I so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going this is</font>

156
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:17,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to be a cheap little thingy</font>

157
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:20,989
anyhow I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think for a lot of system</font>

158
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:26,960
companies to be involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it has</font>

159
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:29,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have enough are put up acceptance by</font>

160
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,250
standards committees otherwise you know

161
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,279
you cannot have interoperable solutions

162
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,390
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing lot of people</font>

163
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,820
who buy the equipment won't be

164
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable buying from a very esoteric</font>

165
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,430
solution well yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have</font>

166
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,150
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works but that doesn't</font>

167
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:49,969
mean it has to go through i triple e i

168
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:53,480
think india not against doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

169
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,910
gig if that's what our customers demand

170
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,500
we will do that but we will also try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

171
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,560
get whatever we are doing standardized

172
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,839
so let's make use of the facility here

173
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,420
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people are interested in 40 gig</font>

174
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,550
Ethernet you asking what

175
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:15,180
and how many people here are interested

176
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:26,050
in 100 gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a market next</font>

177
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:28,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you Mike use links more of a</font>

178
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,319
comment than the question 40 gig

179
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,940
Ethernet is just a waste of time

180
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,700
absolutely waste of time you can do 40

181
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,830
gig now using trunks you use trunk 10

182
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,360
gig Ethernet the cost of fiber certainly

183
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,420
in London means I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

184
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,850
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and buy cwdm Zen packs I can just go</font>

185
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,310
rent fiber and i will do a 40 gig trunk

186
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,930
and it will work mostly as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as i</font>

187
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have load balancing issues and if</font>

188
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">i talk to nice people like your company</font>

189
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll go and make those go away by</font>

190
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,670
implementing a sensible load hashing

191
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,370
algorithm so 40 gig is a waste of time

192
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need 100 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i need it before</font>

193
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,360
2013

194
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,839
with all due respect to the previous

195
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:23,339
comment there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

196
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,520
who would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 40 gig it</font>

197
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,100
delivered in a extremely economical

198
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,400
fashion delivered over a single fiber

199
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,370
and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many ways making that</font>

200
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,610
happen to be sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to pick</font>

201
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">one</font>

202
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:49,099
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eva with Yahoo um actually if you</font>

203
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,980
guys had 100 gig that was ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip</font>

204
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">today we'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be ready to buy it today</font>

206
00:10:53,329 --> 00:11:04,160
gig that was ready to ship today would

207
