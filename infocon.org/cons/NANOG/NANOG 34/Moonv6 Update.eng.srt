1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,990
okay right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm going to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:11,519
bit today about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moon v6 project</font>

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,969
actually I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a bit about</font>

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,440
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the testing that we've done</font>

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:18,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the future stuff going on</font>

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,510
really this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to heighten the</font>

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:26,189
awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the project kind of a call</font>

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:29,279
for participation moon v6 is led by the

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,960
North American IP physics task force and

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,059
it's geared to execute deployment of

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,989
testing ipv6 technology a number of

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,370
government agencies as well as academics

13
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,800
such as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of New Hampshire</font>

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,980
in particular they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like the</font>

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,769
hub of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moon b6 really as well as service</font>

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,339
providers and vendors I'll take part in

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,379
this project a number of test items are

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,449
determined by the operational

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,430
requirements of service providers and

20
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,829
government agencies and everybody kind

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">of gets together and composes various</font>

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:10,500
test plans here's a map of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moon v6</font>

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,260
network as it is today you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it's</font>

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,030
a lot of extensive connectivity here drn

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mci may East and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mae West in</font>

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,400
particular it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a really great</font>

27
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,580
environment for us to get some

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,810
real-world kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests and going on</font>

29
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:33,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely an extensive network at this</font>

30
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:36,780
point so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit to the phase</font>

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,299
one testing some simple routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,020
tests were conducted ospf bgp for in

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:46,950
native<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual-stack modes some common</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">network apps dns HTTP FTP so on and so</font>

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,880
forth neighbor discovery stuff was

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,270
touched on as well as some of the

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition mechanisms everything seemed</font>

38
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work pretty well there there was some</font>

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,159
limited testing of security and advanced

40
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,158
routing protocol features and I should

41
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,129
mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things here in phase one the</font>

42
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,879
primary testing was conducted in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UNH</font>

43
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,910
lab and secondly all the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all</font>

44
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,130
the stuff that I'm talking

45
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,440
all the testing everything details<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

46
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,920
all that are available at<font color="#CCCCCC"> movies 6 org</font>

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,890
and i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that URL at the end in</font>

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,369
phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 then a fully operational network</font>

49
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,649
v6 network was established UNH obtained

50
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,430
a unique AAS and started<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing with</font>

51
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:39,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">18t and internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and really the</font>

52
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:43,380
testing involved phase 1 items<font color="#E5E5E5"> just more</font>

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,260
refined and lengthened in terms of the

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:50,400
testing period so some significant

55
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:55,269
commercial testing was completed with

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,950
ospf bgp and is is and some qos and

57
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:01,180
multicast proof of concept testing and

58
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:03,010
in multicast here really this was just a

59
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,380
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> network segment in this in this</font>

60
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,390
particular test so no routing involved

61
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,880
really there also some firewall

62
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:15,640
functionality tests for phase 2 in 2004

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,769
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> November some additional testing was</font>

64
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,799
conducted with routing convergence some

65
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:23,170
more firewall functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,750
testing was<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some deeper testing</font>

67
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,390
there also a couple of demonstrations

68
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:32,560
VoIP and I scuzzy were conducted in

69
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:36,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">November and then most recently the</font>

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,870
April application demonstration which is

71
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,420
where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally got more involved</font>

72
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:47,440
what we basically did was<font color="#E5E5E5"> provided some</font>

73
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:49,179
transport for for this demonstration may

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,880
was hosted some applications in

75
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,300
particular france<font color="#E5E5E5"> telecom provided an e</font>

76
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,280
presentation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> mae west coast at that</font>

77
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,989
panasonic also offered up some web

78
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,310
enabled cameras for some of the testing

79
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:07,390
as well some of the network details mci

80
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,660
provided in OC 3 2 UNH which connected

81
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:14,410
them to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> east and enabled us to get</font>

82
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:19,120
some peering going with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s 8 16 which</font>

83
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:22,089
is MCI ipv6 test network as well as a s

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,030
6066 which is a

85
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:27,820
network that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of my last and then</font>

86
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:32,229
loosen provided the DNS infrastructure

87
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,870
fall of that here are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few pages to</font>

88
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,659
take a look at regarding bits of

89
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,940
information on the testing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot</font>

90
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,380
one thing to note here is that you're

91
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:47,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to need Firefox for this</font>

92
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:49,659
particular syntax so for the e

93
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,090
presentation unicast testing was

94
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,450
completed and went fairly well the

95
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,940
multicast testing being performed right

96
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:01,840
now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't initially was build a</font>

97
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:06,490
very simple multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network spanning</font>

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,440
the country with just a single RP and

99
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,900
doing static RP basically just to

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,000
provide a conduit<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the multicast</font>

101
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,919
application testing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving forward</font>

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're going to do is get into more</font>

103
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,340
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with really test the</font>

104
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:25,570
multicast Network side in of itself in

105
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,909
more depth some additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing has</font>

106
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,270
been conducted by some other MCI

engineers ipv6 transition with GRE

108
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,400
tunnels over an MPLS core has been

<font color="#E5E5E5">about protocols there bgp eyes is Sarah</font>

112
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,729
um some scalability and convergence

113
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,900
testing was conducted as well and the

114
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:52,000
results of these tests are due out in I

115
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,780
suppose about the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the month so</font>

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,780
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite available yet</font>

117
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,170
some future test items routing again but

118
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,700
more on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> QSR measurement side of</font>

119
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,690
things coming down the pike firewall

120
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,539
looking to get into some attack

121
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,070
scenarios as well as implementing

122
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,670
formatting policies and seeing what

123
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:17,340
breaks there some emphasis on voice over

124
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,740
IP in the next round transition

125
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,429
mechanisms always going to be some

126
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,220
emphasis there as well as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre major</font>

127
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,950
emphasis that's next go around on a

128
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,740
conference scene and e-learning so again

129
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:35,880
the multicast stuff more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

130
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">depth there under movie 6 the</font>

131
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:44,210

132
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,470
some progress in ipv6 implementation um

133
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,500
but more applications are really needed

134
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,530
for testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so any idea is that any of</font>

135
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,620
you have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all please bring them out to</font>

136
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:59,130
us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can hopefully get</font>

137
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,110
something working there we do expect

138
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,840
more participation from enterprises and

139
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,520
government agencies in the next phases

140
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,700
but we definitely do need additional

141
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,140
volunteer resources so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

142
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,349
call for participation as well like I

143
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,479
said earlier if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

144
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,020
involved in the next round of testing

145
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:23,130
which is going to be conducted in August

146
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:28,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should contact moon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d6 by May 31st</font>

147
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:31,140
and to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just go to movie 6 org</font>

148
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,330
that that site will give you

149
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,719
instructions on who to contact and how

150
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:39,960
to get involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well as the detailed</font>

151
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,300
test plans and results that I refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

152
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,299
earlier and that's it

153
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:58,540
you have questions what 1 i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

154
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,010
comment here you're putting up ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs</font>

155
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:06,100
and here we are at a network forum where

156
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:10,060
are we even able to resolve and make use

157
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:13,060
of zone 6<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs yes I tested them</font>

158
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,500
yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that so this</font>

159
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something where maybe we can start</font>

160
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,400
the ball rolling as a community here and

161
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,920
start saying hey let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just talk</font>

162
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,560
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 in theoretical deployments or</font>

163
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,450
testbed scenarios but start using it in

164
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:31,600
real practical obligations like that

165
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:34,299
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you absolutely I'm sorry we're</font>

166
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:39,550
done with the questions hi Bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are</font>

167
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so I just to follow up on that since</font>

168
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:44,319
there is ipv6 native or not not native

169
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,610
connectivity here but there's ipv6

170
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,400
connectivity here it would have been

171
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,020
nice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually had stuff that</font>

172
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">would work in most of the browsers that</font>

173
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:58,600
we have such a safari and such on our

174
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:01,000
laptops the the address in the brackets

175
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay excellent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but to also show off</font>

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,750
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS that ipv6 DNS is important</font>

177
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,120
to to work around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NX domain problems</font>

178
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,070
that some people had in addition to that

179
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,550
what providers have you found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

180
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,950
doing native ipv6 on a global scale in

181
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,579
this because the goal of this project is

182
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to promote the native v6 mm-hmm correct</font>

183
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,100
so well in transition mechanisms yeah

184
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,320
yeah so so I find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

185
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,360
interesting because majority of the

186
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,120
providers have just a tunnel

187
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,250
infrastructure to do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that including</font>

188
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mci network which you're connecting</font>

189
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,360
to as well that's correct whereas

190
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,370
there's other providers out there which

191
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,000
actually do have native<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 networks</font>

192
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,970
that either span regions are globally

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,860
right yeah certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Asia pakka's has a</font>

194
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,390
few out there right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now well including</font>

195
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,800
here in the US there's at least one

196
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,529
major provider that I'm aware of that

197
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,550
has a as a native ipv6

198
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:03,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this global</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dual stack v4 or v6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

199
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:10,329
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> No yeah it's it's a very</font>

200
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:12,519
ill I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry hi I medical care from</font>

201
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:15,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">double shot security one of my major</font>

202
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,709
comments or my hope would be that moon

203
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:21,248
made six would concentrate more on ipsec

204
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:23,888
testing since ipsec seems to make ipv6

205
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:27,269
inherently more secure and I find very

206
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:34,050
limited testing of that i would suggest

207
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:36,999
contacting us and getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved so</font>

208
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,878
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a question coming in</font>

209
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:45,240
from somewhere else all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

210
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much Steve get yourself up here</font>
