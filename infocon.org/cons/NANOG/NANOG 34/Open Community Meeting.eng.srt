with nanog operations in general some

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,079
observations that they had which then

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,470
led to some additional discussions in

somebody it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always tough using</font>

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,129
somebody elses<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here so</font>

66
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,359
what I wanted to do today just briefly

67
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,190
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the assumption that</font>

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,470
if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken the time to be here and</font>

69
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,120
perhaps stayed light that that you've

70
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">already read through these materials and</font>

71
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,250
in fact a lot of you had a hand in

72
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,500
producing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog reform bylaws draft</font>

73
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,380
but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run through the major</font>

74
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,640
points very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just as a recap in</font>

75
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:42,040
case there's somebody in the room who's

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:44,350
coming to this light so we've we've

77
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,359
cribbed from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana reform proposal</font>

78
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:52,810
quite a lot we at<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit have talked</font>

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,940
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than just the folks who who</font>

80
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">are directly involved in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog we've</font>

81
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,900
talked a lot about the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

82
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">been proposed by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reform community</font>

83
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,680
over the over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past year and and find</font>

84
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:08,470
a whole lot of sense and<font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value and</font>

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so by and large we find</font>

86
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,739
ourselves in agreement with the things

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,470
have been proposed we've put together a

88
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,620
plan which we sent out a mail mail

89
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,839
message about we<font color="#E5E5E5"> intend to implement the</font>

90
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan over the summer and make this</font>

91
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,099
actually happen this isn't just talking

92
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,290
points our intention is to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

93
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,419
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to give this opportunity</font>

94
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,640
today for people to say their their

95
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,140
piece if they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not going</font>

96
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,690
far enough if you think we're going too

97
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,570
far that's what we're looking for today

98
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,450
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't talk much about this this is</font>

99
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,490
just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an amalgam of the current</font>

100
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:47,070
mission and the and some new language

101
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,070
out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new document</font>

102
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:56,409
one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things so the the</font>

103
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">NetID reform bylaws proposal was written</font>

104
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:01,389
from the point of view of nanog as a

105
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:03,128
separate organization of course nanog is

106
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:09,189
not a separate organization man out is

107
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:12,219
something that that merit does and that

108
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:14,289
at least for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment needs to stay</font>

109
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:16,149
that way and and the end that has some

110
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,399
fallout later on in the proposed charter

111
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,829
as you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen but just a</font>

112
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,249
reminder<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nana is a merit activity</font>

113
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:25,749
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that merits committed to</font>

114
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:28,209
we're enthusiastic about the changes

115
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:29,889
that that have been proposed we believe

116
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:31,689
that that it's critical for the future

117
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,699
success<font color="#CCCCCC"> of nanog and we are committed</font>

118
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,989
committed to the success of nanog we

119
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,699
wouldn't be doing this if we didn't

120
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:42,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">think these changes were really</font>

121
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:43,509
necessary and useful as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned in</font>

122
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,909
my message which probably all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

123
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,349
have seen we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had merit have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly</font>

124
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:49,319
strong opinion about the question of

125
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:52,360
membership there are a couple of issues

126
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,999
one issue is purely mechanical if we

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">establish a membership class which is</font>

128
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:58,869
separate from meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> attendances as</font>

129
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">eligibility for voting then we have to</font>

130
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:03,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">put some sort of infrastructure in place</font>

131
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:04,929
for managing membership that that's

132
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:07,269
purely a mechanical issue there would be

133
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:09,399
effort and cost involved with that and

134
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:11,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if we were going to do that we need</font>

135
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it's worth doing we also</font>

136
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:17,079
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> strong feelings perhaps</font>

137
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:19,259
rooted in the history of nanog that that

138
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,129
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something special about</font>

139
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,849
participation in the face to face

140
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:27,099
meeting and we understand that there was

141
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,378
I believe I wasn't involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

142
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:31,419
entire nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> reform discussion I wasn't</font>

143
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,309
on my mailing list but but I believe

144
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there were extensive discussions on</font>

145
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,549
the question of voting rights and

146
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:38,079
membership and we may hear some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of</font>

147
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:41,289
that today<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we're proposing that</font>

148
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,089
eligibility for voting be determined

149
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:46,688
solely by registration<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a meeting and</font>

150
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:48,839
and we use the word registration very

151
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:52,089
specifically as opposed to attendance

152
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,649
again if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we used attendance is the</font>

153
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,989
criterion we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to establish</font>

154
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:58,329
some sort of mechanism for tracking

155
00:06:55,989 --> 00:07:02,219
attendance and we already track

156
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:05,670
registration that one's easy this also

157
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,470
if you feel really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly that you</font>

158
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,360
never want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to an an odd meeting</font>

159
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,980
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sure want to vote and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then this</font>

160
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives you kind of a backdoor membership</font>

161
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,800
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of it that</font>

162
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,239
way if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to register for a</font>

163
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,980
meeting once every two years then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

164
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,200
can vote you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to show up you</font>

165
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:24,420
just have to register we we are

166
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,700
proposing that that we go with the six

167
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,200
persons<font color="#E5E5E5"> six elected member steering</font>

168
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,250
committee with a seventh member

169
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:36,289
appointed by merit steering committee

170
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:39,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">would appoint the program committee</font>

171
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:42,240
would appoint the mailing list

172
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,700
administration team would work with

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,700
merit on on the budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> and would be</font>

174
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:51,270
deeply involved in fiscal issues for

175
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,539
Nana would work with merit to provide

176
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:59,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">leo just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went if I can ask a question</font>

177
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:02,490
before the presentation sure previously

178
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,010
you said that anyone who registers for

179
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,930
Nana can participate in the vote yeah

180
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,190
and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion about</font>

181
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know in the your form</font>

182
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:14,040
conversations are you suggesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

183
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,540
people could register and then not show

184
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,060
up and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> not pay the registration</font>

185
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,700
fees and still participate are you

186
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,400
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is in fact a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a for fee</font>

187
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,800
Way of voting it will cost you a hundred

188
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,870
bucks or 25 bucks or what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model</font>

189
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you had in your mind no we're</font>

190
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,349
suggesting that that a paid registration

191
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:37,500
is your is your ticket to vote basically

192
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,570
so in effect 350 every two years 350

193
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,979
every two years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you want to</font>

194
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of that as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a membership fee than</font>

195
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,330
you can but we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly hope that</font>

196
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would show up since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

197
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:51,050
there's tremendous value in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the face to</font>

198
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,050
face yeah thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the clarification</font>

199
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,420
let's see I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on liaison so we</font>

200
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,000
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the steering committee to work</font>

201
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,900
with with merit on liaison with other

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
organizations the various other regional

203
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:11,050
registries and and operator forums and

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,480
those sorts of things and we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed</font>

205
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,310
in the the new charter to enshrine in

206
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,630
the Charter some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

207
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,319
happening informally with the program

208
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:23,080
committee that we establish criteria for

209
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,840
participation that that we have a way of

210
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,000
dealing with the occasional person who

211
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,110
might might get elected to a steering

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,580
committee or appointed to a program

213
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,870
committee and then find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't</font>

214
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,270
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of</font>

215
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,160
hang on there needs to be some standard

216
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,720
for participation in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font>

217
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,709
to sit on either the steering committee

218
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,060
or the program committee steering

219
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">committee elections would take place</font>

220
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,050
nominally at the last meeting during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

221
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,060
calendar year this first time we're

222
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,170
proposing that that we advanced that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

223
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,239
little bit so we'd have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a steering</font>

224
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">committee in place in October in Los</font>

225
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,820
Angeles so this first steering committee

226
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:01,540
would sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 13 or 14 months instead of</font>

227
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,000
12 months we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an open</font>

228
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,800
nomination process candidates would

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,490
supply BIOS to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be posted on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

230
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">so everybody can see with the</font>

231
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,290
qualifications of the people who are

232
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,290
running and they would be an election

233
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,420
mailing list moderation would be and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

234
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,180
so different<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the way it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is now we</font>

235
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,920
as you all know implemented a mailing

236
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,959
list administration team we're proposing

237
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,360
that team would be would be appointed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

238
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,860
the steering committee three members

239
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">appointed by the steering committee one</font>

240
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,880
member appointed by maurette

241
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,060
we would propose to continue with the

242
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,649
three conferences a year although this

243
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,119
is something the steering committee we

244
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,620
would expect would talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about there's</font>

245
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,290
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to</font>

246
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">to conferences a year we would expect</font>

247
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,889
that would be a steering committee topic

248
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,339
among the other sorts of strategic

249
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:55,959
topics for the steering<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee and we</font>

250
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,699
would certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> look to the steering</font>

251
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for guidance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and help in</font>

252
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,099
selecting hosts and meeting locations

253
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,949
and in fact addressing the question of

254
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,660
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts are selected and and citing</font>

255
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:09,430
for the for the meetings I understand

256
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are differing opinions about about</font>

257
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,540
moving around versus staying in one

258
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:17,620
place for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example program committee</font>

259
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:23,500
would be appointed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the steering</font>

260
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:25,449
committee we were proposing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a a</font>

261
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,310
member of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> steering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> committee serve</font>

262
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:28,779
ex officio on the program committee and

263
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,790
that the chair of the program committee

264
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:32,980
served ex officio on the steering

265

committee in both<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases without a vote</font>

266
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,959
in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide ly important liaison</font>

267
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:42,759
role between the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups so the two</font>

268
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:45,969
groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get out of sync and we're</font>

269
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:49,029
proposing a modification from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nanog</font>

270
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,110
reform draft by law proposal we believe

271
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,360
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be a way for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

272
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,699
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring forward changes a</font>

273
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,579
formal process<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bringing forward to</font>

274
00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:00,670
forward changes so we propose<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

275
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:03,069
the community can originate proposed

276
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,769
amendments to the Charter and I think

277
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:08,979
that's the end of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides so can a</font>

278
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:13,149
steering committee committee voted on

279
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:16,689
both I I believe that that the proposal

280
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,100
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that the two groups</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

281
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:20,230
separate you need to be either one or

282
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,970
the other except for the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

283
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange of prisoners that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we proposed</font>

284
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,139
both of them especially the program

285
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,610
committee but both of them if the

286
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:33,790
steering<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee is really active or</font>

287
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:36,120
likely to be big jobs and asking one

288
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,469
person to take on both could be tough

289
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus you'd be appointing yourself which</font>

290
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,800
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

291
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:50,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so Steve wanted to say a few words</font>

292
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,770
or we<font color="#CCCCCC"> strong-armed Stephen to stay</font>

293
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,530
English saying a few words from the

294
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,760
perspective of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a program committee</font>

295
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,380
member i don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> steve's and</font>

296
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,800
speaking on behalf of the program

297
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,080
committee just<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that perspective</font>

298
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,589
couldn't possibly presume to speak for

299
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:14,760
just myself well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm reasonably happy</font>

300
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:17,340
with this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing has been somewhat</font>

301
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an education</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font>

302
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,270
out what the community wants what merits

303
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,070
needs are and all that one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

304
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think has really been a good</font>

305
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that came out of this was merit</font>

306
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,750
had to stand back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

307
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,910
merits rolling in<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should be and it</font>

308
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,730
took some pressure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Merritt has done</font>

309
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,620
I think a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> job of deciding that and</font>

310
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:41,550
in making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so we can move forward now</font>

311
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,970
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm happy about</font>

312
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:48,900
with the proposal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it does ensure</font>

313
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,910
some continuity going forward so that we

314
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,650
don't end up with the case where it's a

315
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,930
whole bunch of new people starting from

316
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,410
scratch trying to replicate what's been

317
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:02,939
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past but it also requires</font>

318
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,800
some new blood to be important so others

319
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:12,510
can see what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> glamour job the program</font>

320
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:13,729
committee is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example and ya can't</font>

321
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,380
think of much else to say on the subject

322
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:19,410
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

323
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,850
the one of the best of a range of

324
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,270
possible outcomes that I saw going into

325
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,270
the process

326
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:30,210
okay thanks Steve Martin we also

327
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,490
prevailed on Martin to say a few words

328
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:35,900
again not representing but from the

329
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,130
perspective of a banana reform group

330
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,920
yeah so I'm Martin Hannigan I don't

331
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:44,010
speak for anybody but me sounds good to

332
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">me I talked to Dan Goulding and rod</font>

333
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:50,520
cistrome who weren't able think my

334
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">comments sounds good to me and I think</font>

335
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,310
that um it was good to have merit have a

336
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,080
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> pressure to take a look at the</font>

337
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,810
way things were working in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past and</font>

338
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,490
to analyze what needs to be done to go

339
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:07,739
forward I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on I think I think</font>

340
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,130
it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know you guys are</font>

341
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,840
renewing your<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and that uh you know</font>

342
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:17,939
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get a little bit of self</font>

343
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:21,030
self self rule so to speak and I think

344
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,690
that um I think it's all good that's

345
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:27,689

348
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,710
outside looking in and you know if

issues alive and making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that merit</font>

363
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:15,930
address these issues I think the every

364
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,520
organization evolves and nanog hadn't

365
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,229
evolved for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was time for</font>

366
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,280
Nana to evolve and we're enthusiastic

367
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,390
about this evolution so thank you very

368
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:30,030
much

369
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:34,230

370
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,850
that we really believe in in the changes

371
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:40,680
that we're planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make this summer</font>

372
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:42,620
this is I probably can't say anything

373
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:48,780
that will will convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you're</font>

374
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:50,040
skeptical or or worse paranoid I can't

375
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,839
say anything that would convince you

376
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that we're sincere about this but i</font>

377
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,740
will say that that we're sincere about

378
00:16:54,210 --> 00:17:00,450
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes that that we believe that</font>

379
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,770
the folks who are who are committed to

380
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,640
nanog who are members of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net on</font>

381
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:09,030
community know best what they need and

382
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,949
and that merit as merit operates<font color="#E5E5E5"> nana</font>

383
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:14,699
needs to listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the input from the</font>

384
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:17,190
community and I'm sincere in making that

385
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,709
happen we are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen this is</font>

386
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,420
not just a token effort that we're doing

387
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,339
hoping that everybody will<font color="#E5E5E5"> think oh well</font>

388
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,040
they they agreed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and now we'll</font>

389
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:28,190
worry about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else for a while</font>

390
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,350
so yeah questions and comments like to

391
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:34,170
unban<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vijay go i would like to mention</font>

392
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what what all this process</font>

393
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:40,140
has managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to generate is a lot of</font>

394
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,240
political BS and we are starting to look

395
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,190
more and more like I tu I like the way

396
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,380
the old nanog thing worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I thought</font>

397
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,960
it worked fine for many years then we

398
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,040
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who taught let's</font>

399
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,720
go and change this thing without

400
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,980
realizing the ramifications of doing

401
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,410
this stuff and realizing that it's

402
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much harder than it</font>

403
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,960
looks from setting outside it's easier

404
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,760
to wine than it is to actually do so

405
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,320
what it looks like here is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

406
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">going down the route of ITU and if</font>

407
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,300
there's ever a steering committee and

408
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">then study groups to study like changes</font>

409
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,490
going forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of nanog</font>

410
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,230
is lost the point of nanog has not been

411
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,360
presentations and meetings the point of

412
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,310
nanog has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> business done in the</font>

413
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,189
inter-cities of the meeting it's the

414
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,350
hallway conversations it's a group that

415
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,740
most of the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> i drive from nanog</font>

416
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:31,830
comes from and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think putting voting</font>

417
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,750
and memberships and that's all putting

418
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,870
bureaucracy around the experience that

419
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog useful</font>

420
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:43,300
me that's my thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi I'm Steve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gibbard</font>

421
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,390
I was the main author of the original

422
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,180
nanog reform proposal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last of</font>

423
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,490
several editors on what I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> became</font>

424
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:55,000
the nanog reform by law proposal that I

425
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,280
think you used a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of in in your</font>

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposal thank you for thank you for</font>

427
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,080
doing all the hard work yeah so did I

428
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,990
paid us a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing and so I'd just</font>

429
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to thank you for for your proposal</font>

430
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:11,679
and i think that the changes that you

431
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,480
made what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had worked on ra a positive</font>

432
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,710
thing and that it came out a lot better

433
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,070
in your version than it was in my

434
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:23,410
version oh thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

435
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,389
my name is Mitchell rose and in the

436
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:32,070
initial mission statement that you

437
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:32,070
showed right yeah go back

438
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:40,710
so you point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's for internet</font>

439
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,860
providers and the such how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

440
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:46,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">that with the blurring of like large</font>

441
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,830
enterprises I work for Microsoft and

442
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,049
I've have as large of the network if not

443
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,049
larger than many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that come here</font>

444
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:58,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from the ISP side to a large</font>

445
00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:01,619
enterprise I'm seeing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of instances</font>

446
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,539
where if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly an operator's group</font>

447
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:05,039
right there's certainly best practices

448
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,809
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font>

449
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,249
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be shared in that are</font>

450
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:11,158
shared like Vijay was saying in the

451
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:13,710
hallways you know there are common

452
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,740
problems that we have do you see

453
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:22,619
bringing more of that in or just keeping

454
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:24,090
it is p centric well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

455
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,590
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steering committee and</font>

456
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">the program committee the committee that</font>

457
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,789
may sound like a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cop-out answer</font>

458
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,919
but but I don't presume to know the

459
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,509
answer to that question I think that's

460
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,549
something for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community to discuss</font>

461
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:37,499
yeah from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program committee</font>

462
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:40,679
perspective we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

463
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:44,100

464
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:47,940
company that would really qualify under

the original<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP only a charter of nanog</font>

appear with anybody we only by transit

468
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,779
but we do share a lot of the same

469
00:20:54,629 --> 00:21:00,389
problems and I do believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is</font>

470
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:02,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of common ground</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the</font>

475
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,799

477
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,149
players those people other people who

478
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:23,539
run big networks that aren't just

479
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,539
backbones

480
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:32,150
I'm short my name is Chris milady I'm at

481
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,550
EDS I serve on the mail the

482
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,560
administration committee my question is

483
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,480
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proposed change to the mail</font>

484
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,230
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> administration committee where we</font>

485
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,720
go from three members appointed from the

486
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">steering committee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and one member right</font>

487
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,720
now we have two members from Merritt

488
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,139
that sit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a nice</font>

489
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,320
balance because there's five people so

490
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,510
you can't get into a tie per se in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

491
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,120
way that it works plus I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

492
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,280
this particular case though down the

493
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,709
road it could be revisited i think that

494
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,730
the that both employees from Merritt

495
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:10,340
have radically different experiences and

496
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:14,090
both have have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been on the list for a</font>

497
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:17,480
long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and provide a lot of help to</font>

498
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,010
the volunteers from the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> too I</font>

499
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,050
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you should look at changing</font>

500
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,070
it back to having two members from

501
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,740
Merritt on the mailing list

502
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">administration committee so just one</font>

503
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,830
from being<font color="#E5E5E5"> from being on it and seeing</font>

504
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,689
the it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy seeing seeing that I</font>

505
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,649
think that I really think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

506
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,290
sure that there's two there would

507
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,810
probably I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it remains that</font>

508
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeps the balance and still we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still get</font>

509
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,780
the the knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the marriage</font>

510
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,390
staff of historical data which is

511
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,970
invaluable for the rest of us as we go

512
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,590
forward I'd also like to say to Vijay I

513
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,540
think he's completely wrong but that's

514
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">only my opinion and I think that the</font>

515
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,409
reform proposal is fabulous thank you

516
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so Vijay is going to rebut your</font>

517
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,720
statement but can I before you before

518
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,139
you were but the he's completely wrong

519
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,210
part can can I ask what other people

520
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,190
think about the question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number</font>

521
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,990
of members and the composition in fact

522
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,550
week so that I think they're two

523
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,820
questions do we have an odd number so

524
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,139
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> never a tie and in order to get</font>

525
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,730
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd number should there be to</font>

526
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,140
merit members should there be four

527
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,790
members appointed by the steering

528
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">committee and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one appointed by merit</font>

529
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,710
what do people have an opinion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

530
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,960
yeah I suppose

531
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,040
then you can back rub and CC I'm not

532
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,490
being you going to give you a straight

533
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:44,060
answer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what you want to do</font>

534
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:49,670
in any of this is you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

535
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:52,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">carefully about what kind of functions</font>

536
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:57,430
require continuity and quote paid staff

537
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:00,470
unquote and what functions require

538
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:03,830
representative things from the community

539
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,870
or involvement of volunteers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

540
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,909
that should be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guiding principle so</font>

541
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is not this do we need two</font>

542
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,560
people for marathon<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on this</font>

543
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular mailing list committee or</font>

544
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,909
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called but how much</font>

545
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">continuity do you want there because if</font>

546
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:23,300
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> put volunteers there there's a</font>

547
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,379
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of continuity but no guarantee so</font>

548
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,290
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to think about this</font>

549
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,420
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we did it a lot a long</font>

550
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,350
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago in right where we had ripe and</font>

551
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,840
we were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff with</font>

552
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:36,949
volunteers and then we created the ripe

553
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">NCC to have a paid staff component and</font>

554
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">and quite consciously did that even</font>

555
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:44,629
before this in number registration game

556
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,280
started so think think about it what's

557
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,080
what's best done by volunteers and

558
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,149
what's best done by paid staff and then

559
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,040
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> your decisions according that's a</font>

560
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:58,730
good point my rebuttal actually is al is

561
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,820
ask the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community do things a it's the</font>

562
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:05,990
content stupid so ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> since we</font>

563
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:08,120
implemented this this mailing list

564
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,800
committee has the mailing list gotten

565
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,100
any better I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's more crap on</font>

566
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:15,470
it now than there was ever before a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bee</font>

567
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,800
it's just a stupid mailing list we don't

568
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:21,200
need five people to run a stupid mailing

569
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:25,149
list he was procmail Jesus Christ this

570
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,150
is network operators group come on

571
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,700
anybody else think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is stupid or is</font>

572
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,699
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just me</font>

573
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,250
no so there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of crap in the</font>

574
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,960
mailing list I mean you're right and it

575
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,460
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stupid mailing list no one's</font>

576
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,120
going to lose their life over the nanog

577
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,670
mailing list but you know the the the

578
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,709
subscription I think goes up every so

579
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,660
often and the messages by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trends</font>

580
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,820
that we show that the the mail<font color="#E5E5E5"> English</font>

581
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,080
that the other community meeting show

582
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,330
that there's more more things being

583
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,220
posted I mean you know I think I gave an

584
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,659
opinion that night that said the mailing

585
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,880
list is too big maybe that's something

586
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,980
that instead of trying to figure out you

587
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,500
know I'm with you on delete key and proc

588
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">no but it seems like the majority you</font>

589
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,120
people aren't for some reason and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

590
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:19,360
may not be true as well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

591
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,830
what the middle is and what merit could

592
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,649
do to make everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy or what we</font>

593
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,659
could do to make ourselves happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

594
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,660

00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:58,029
ok

602
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,340
after a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year of heated discussions I</font>

603
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:09,020
can't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have 15 minutes</font>

604
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,020
worth of questions and comments

605
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:17,280
here I say we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have we cut</font>

606
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,540
them the mailing list censorship board

607
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,389
whatever the hell they call it nowadays

608
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,899
the the the Politburo put it down to

609
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">like two people do some of this reform</font>

610
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,090
thing and I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care really I</font>

611
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,160
mean just just get a move on I've wasted

612
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,149
more time of my life doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

613
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,980
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been talking to people and</font>

614
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:38,160
actually moving on with what I really

615
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:41,390
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we should revert</font>

616
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,620
back to what your original proposal was

617
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,940
don't worry about the mailing list don't

618
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,550
worry about like percentage composition

619
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,250
of two from a merit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus one from</font>

620
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:52,710
the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee that I think</font>

621
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:57,210
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just pick three</font>

622
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:59,880
people call it down so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer</font>

623
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,640
to give my spot up on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of EJ and</font>

624
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,510
I support is to person is to present

625
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,790
proposal we should just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to one person</font>

626
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:16,770
may almost in half each I just run it

627
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:19,620
there I you know I I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

628
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,879
here in lies is it that the masses spoke

629
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,310
that they that they wanted it this way

630
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,200
and if you don't if you don't if you

631
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,270
don't if you don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then that's</font>

632
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,630
fine bj<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can't you can't just</font>

633
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,340
just can't just throw away everybody

634
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:38,150
else's opinion and say that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

635
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:43,949
is the way it is I'm sorry there you go

636
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:46,560
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want realistic point of view</font>

637
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the half the people who started off</font>

638
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,740
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big noise about we're going to</font>

639
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,090
reform now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this we're</font>

640
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,320
gonna do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that half of them aren't even</font>

641
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,790
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's because this is hard work</font>

642
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,080
and I appreciate the people who are

643
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,610
doing this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're doing a</font>

644
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,280
pretty good job running it i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

645
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">whiners need to STFU and go do some real</font>

646
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:14,820
networking<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

647
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:16,919
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've got it yeah well i</font>

648
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,480
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right way to</font>

649
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,970
say this so you know everything is

650
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,809
everything is everything is an aprox

651
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,850
nation of everything you try it you see

652
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:31,700
what works if the things that don't work

653
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,559
you fix and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

654
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,210
we're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this so we put the</font>

655
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,158
stuff in place we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the things that</font>

656
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,760
have value we keep the things that don't

657
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:42,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">have value we work on we don't build</font>

658
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,640
bureaucracy that lasts for for a million

659
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:49,100
years if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right I</font>

660
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,260
mean just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reiterate what I said the</font>

661
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,570
other night I think the mailing list

662
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:57,650
experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> moderation experiment has</font>

663
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:59,450
worked I mean the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who complained</font>

664
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,190
about mailing this moderation are now

665
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:05,120
not complaining about mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

666
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:07,190
moderation so to the extent that you

667
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,549
know more experimentation is not really

668
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,990
necessary i'm not sure you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

669
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,090
this should be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard problem</font>

670
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,010
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list moderation should be</font>

671
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,980
something that has a really light touch

672
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and by at large people shouldn't be</font>

673
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it exists at all yes the</font>

674
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,549
signal-to-noise ratio of the nanog list

675
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,159
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> high that's a property of the</font>

676
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:36,460
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people on it low excuse me the</font>

677
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:40,070
noise to<font color="#CCCCCC"> signal ratio is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high yeah</font>

678
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,870
and so for you no formal values some

679
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,428
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of formal evaluation mechanism like</font>

680
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,600
like the surveys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do at the</font>

681
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:46,250
meetings there needs to be some

682
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,750
evaluation mechanism for deciding

683
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,750
whether moderation is working I think

684
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:07,950
yeah so for anybody is listening

685
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineer that the the plan is to do a</font>

686
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,759
survey on mailing list on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing</font>

687
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,529
list after the current program committee

688
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:17,399
surveys completed so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm being</font>

689
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:21,649
multiplied surveyed at once my<font color="#CCCCCC"> cues got</font>

690
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:23,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">dumb limey going home on Thursday so um</font>

691
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:25,199
several large mailing list and not

692
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:26,939
suggesting to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the random</font>

693
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,259
debate this again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again but several</font>

694
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,929
large mailing this have more than one

695
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:32,909
moderator that is normal that is that is

696
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,320
pretty standard at least one of them

697
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:42,090
though has to be the person with<font color="#CCCCCC"> god on</font>

698
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:43,559
the box so you know I think everybody

699
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,629
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's on topic and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

700
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,460
survey idea was a good one only to be

701
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:50,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to go anybody who doesn't</font>

702
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,559
understand what is on topic like go look

703
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,720
at the survey but I mean you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

704
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,480
reality is there are a lot of other

705
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,669
lists out there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sells with like a</font>

706
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,039
you know one guy with<font color="#CCCCCC"> God on the box and</font>

707
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:05,639
they just make things happen now you

708
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,649
know why does a banana glist not not

709
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:11,189
able to do that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as far</font>

710
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:12,238
as like the people who so that I I just

711
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,840
heard someone make this comment I'm

712
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:17,999
sorry I don't remember your name but the

713
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,759
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who were whining about moderation</font>

714
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:24,539
while they're not doing it on the public

715
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:27,409
list anymore they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it to myself</font>

716
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:29,850
Chris and possibly Steve in our ear and

717
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:31,669
when we've asked for feedback from

718
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:34,529
people like what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want us to do</font>

719
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:35,940
there's only been a few cases of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

720
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:38,639
willing to actually give the feedback

721
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,590
now I'm glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're having all this</font>

722
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:43,080
feedback here but where are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> during</font>

723
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,488
like when these things are happening you

724
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of feedback on one</font>

725
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:48,720
issue which I think we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

726
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,600
that is and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we don't really</font>

727
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to debate that but you know so I</font>

728
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,340
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily disagree with Vijay I</font>

729
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:59,850
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily disagree with Joel I</font>

730
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:03,509
think but you know when there are more

731
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,709
people that can't do it then can we you

732
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:07,169
know when you run your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got</font>

733
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,129
to cut your<font color="#E5E5E5"> losses and segregate it's</font>

734
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:10,129
kind of what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do here</font>

735
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:18,840
as an outside observer I have this

736
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">question no you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not an outside</font>

737
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,010
observer you have voting privileges you

738
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:28,140
came to an enemy<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah sure I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

739
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:29,670

742
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:42,750

entertains a motion to adjourn I'm all

744

745
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,610
all afternoon on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a beautiful afternoon</font>

746
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,189
and debate something that's been debated

747
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,580
today I don't know any bad jokes I'm

748
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,630
sorry Mike they're all good jokes

749
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,100
there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I did notice that</font>

750
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,640
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up out of this whole reform thing</font>

751
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,070
and it actually goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a point case he</font>

752
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,130
made a long time ago well we've having

753
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:08,279
these discussions and that is why do

754
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:10,380
things have to get to such a head that

755
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,960
this whole reform movement started in

756
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,460
the first place is there something that

757
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,639
oughta be happening is part of this

758
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,080
whole nanog event that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

759
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,000
that we ought to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so that little</font>

760
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,080
problems don't turn into these big

761
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,449
monster things that may require this<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

762
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,009
organizational shift yeah now<font color="#CCCCCC"> my fingers</font>

763
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:31,230
I have survey forms it has to be a

764
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,899
forest for a long time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we</font>

765
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:36,870
heard earlier that what<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80-some got</font>

766
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:38,429
filled out of life for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a meeting of 400</font>

767
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,199
people yeah that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bad</font>

768
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,668
return rate if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to somebody does</font>

769
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:46,678
surveys for a living that's not a bad

770
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:50,219
return rate i think i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer bills</font>

771
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,530
question by saying that yeah at least

772
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,330
among those of us who you know started

773
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,270
discussing the several months ago the<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

774
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,710
think the feeling on that was that what

775
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:01,259
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that difference was a lot</font>

776
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">more open communication and I think</font>

777
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,420
we've we've gotten to that point now

778
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,710
yeah so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Danielle suggests you know I</font>

779
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,070
think I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go declare victory</font>

780
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:14,760
and have a nice afternoon here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

781
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:17,310
noticing in response to Mitchell's

782
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,720
comment while back about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word</font>

783
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,270
internet providers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mission</font>

784
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,980
statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where that leaves big</font>

785
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,280
networks that are not selling internet

786
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">service</font>

787
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,770
but our operating big complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

788
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,990
networks I'd suggest changing that to

789
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:34,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">two network operators instead of</font>

790
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,189
internet providers

791
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,870
second paragraph on the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

792
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,870
middle on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen</font>

793
00:35:50,450 --> 00:36:08,430
call it network operators yeah

794
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:13,029
okay yeah I think you're right i think

795
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:15,339
closing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the loop i will help i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

796
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,690
being deliberate about communicating

797
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,520
about these issues you know having

798
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,690
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meta conversation not just</font>

799
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,680
having the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the the</font>

800
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,350
topics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talks that we're having</font>

801
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:30,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">this week but having the conversation</font>

802
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">about men on which which you need to be</font>

803
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,340
deliberate about you need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

804
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,370
to have that conversation you perhaps

805
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,200
don't have to set aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> a total of seven</font>

806
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,970
hours at each nanog meeting to do this

807
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,970
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of an unusual</font>

808
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,620
transition circumstance but doing the

809
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,020
surveys and then feeding the results of

810
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,029
the surveys back talking about the

811
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,200
finances like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did on Sunday night</font>

812
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,730
which was the first time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

813
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,770
happened providing an opportunity maybe

814
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,690
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short opportunity at each at each</font>

815
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,860
net I'm meeting for people to stand up

816
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what they think about the way</font>

817
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:05,200
things are going I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think all of these</font>

818
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:08,890
things and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> making that discussion</font>

819
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,779
about nanog itself deliberate paying

820
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,790
some attention to it will keep us from

821
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:18,220
getting to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place where you</font>

822
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:20,050
need a revolution although sometimes you

823
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:22,750
just need a revolution right I'm going

824
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to relay some stuff from run from an IRC</font>

825
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:27,910
so there's she had a couple of feedback

826
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,710
items that she wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in in terms</font>

827
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the content of the meeting she said</font>

828
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be appearing buff each</font>

829
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,820
meeting that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the middle of the</font>

830
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:38,109
night and IX panel each meeting the

831
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,340
surveys have always had feedback about

832
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,210
not putting the peering buff in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

833
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:47,100
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the night and it still happens</font>

834
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:50,710
see it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> balam the scheduling</font>

835
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,730
people have Claire joe said to not

836
00:37:50,710 --> 00:38:00,520
scheduled the meeting during

837
00:37:51,730 --> 00:38:03,310
non-business hours change the surveys to

838
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,509
have different questions I think that's

839
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:11,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it</font>

840
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:14,029
I don't know so you can do you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

841
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:18,409
don't know how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so i</font>

842
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:21,339
can only relay the question ran what

843
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:21,339
questions do you want

844
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:32,379
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was both I think not</font>

845
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,480
only was it when we should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but</font>

846
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,740
if should we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and I</font>

847
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,539
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that her point is we should have</font>

848
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,109
them each meeting and they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font>

849
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:44,430
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of the night I can comment</font>

850
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:48,190
on a couple of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things yes we know</font>

851
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:49,509
we tried to arrange the schedule so we

852
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,869
wouldn't have to have late<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluffs this</font>

853
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:55,029
time because of constraints who weren't

854
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:58,329
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that one of the constraints</font>

855
00:38:55,029 --> 00:39:00,369
of course being this meeting here what

856
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:02,019
we did do this time around was switched

857
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,299
the peering bluff and the security blah

858
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:07,000
so the period<font color="#E5E5E5"> buff was earlier in the</font>

859
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:08,380
security one was later but yeah we would

860
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,119
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a point where we can</font>

861
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the buffs and late in the afternoon</font>

862
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:14,319
or something like that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

863
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,118
going to happen it didn't happen here it

864
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:20,349
may or may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in la</font>

865
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:23,230
will find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> but certainly we haven't</font>

866
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:24,940
forgotten that that's a priority for

867
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:29,500
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we want to work towards</font>

868
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:31,450
that in terms of survey questions if

869
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,009
somebody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design the survey</font>

870
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:36,939
we would be more than happy to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

871
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:40,720
input or even let let you decide it all

872
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:43,150
together we go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> each time debating</font>

873
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,839
which questions to ask and never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

874
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:49,059
come get good answers see there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

875
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,869
another point which I forgotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so</font>

876
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:55,119
I won't bother talking about it hi my

877

name is david cook i'm at EDS I i want

878
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,130
to clarify something around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering</font>

879
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,959
boss there's a larger discussion about

880
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,670
network operations and what network

881
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,410
operations means and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

882
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,410
underlying points there is some of that

883
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:11,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">has shifted over time and I think one</font>

884
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:13,180
subtext is request to somehow feedback

885
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,890
in program committee that which is

886
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,379
shifting and that which is important for

887
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:19,000
the for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network operators this</font>

888
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,670
example was peering there may be other

889
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,690
exam

890
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,940
rotana I think we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be paying</font>

891
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,960
attention to and that was just some work

892
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,960
context around that

893
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,390
just on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box scheduling thing it</font>

894
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,770
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everyone that I talked to and</font>

895
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,480
we've heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on surveys and other</font>

896
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,890
things comes here as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much for</font>

897
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,450
face-to-face time with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and</font>

898
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,069
talking as they do to actually see the

899
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,810
presentations and I've never been able

900
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out why the buffs and other</font>

901
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,980
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> semi-structured forums for</font>

902
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,839
people to do that aren't interleaved in

903
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,790
with the technical program in the day as

904
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:52,020
a part of the focus of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> event since</font>

905
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,020

907
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:09,500
for declaring victory and enjoying the

908
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">day is that the sense of the group well</font>
