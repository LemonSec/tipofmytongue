1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,120
bill hurd from hackaday

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,680
let's do our own surface mount assembly

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,120
okay i'm going to walk you through

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,960
everything today that i know about

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,799
for surface mount assembly we're going

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,160
to go through all the steps

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
including putting the paste down cooking

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,440
it in an oven

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,160
uh inspecting it between those steps big

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,119
thing for me

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,279
so first let's talk about the difference

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,480
there is through hole

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
it is what it says the pins go through

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,880
there this is the older technology

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,720
it's easier to do at home a lot of times

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,399
you can do this with just a soldering

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,120
iron

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,680
then there's surface mount obviously the

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
stuff's on the surface why do that

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,040
less room right it's harder to

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,800
manufacture but it's less

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
room now that can run into problems too

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,399
where you have the ability to create

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:46,960
heat

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
more concentrated but that's an

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,079
engineer's problem we're going to skip

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,280
that for today

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,520
so in the old days we used auto

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
insertion machines these things had

30
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
heads they'd clamp the pins

31
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,320
squeeze them enough they drop straight

32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,879
in the holes and release

33
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,559
we call the things for these pick and

34
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,479
place because they gently pick it up and

35
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,320
place it into solder paste

36
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
before we activate the solder paste the

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
pick and place machines usually a visual

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
visual alignment of the head i mean it's

39
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,400
very precision work

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,799
to do this we can do this at home i'm

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,799
going to show you how

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,360
couple simple things i do like to have

43
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,000
i'm old

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,320
right so i like to have tweezers for my

45
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
shaky hands i like to have a microscope

46
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,960
for my

47
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,600
fading eyes and i usually use a helper

48
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,400
who's young

49
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,119
okay so that's how i do it so let's talk

50
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,920
about these things

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
so let's start with the solder you're

52
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,759
probably familiar with solder in rolls

53
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,360
like we have these come in couple

54
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,640
different flavors

55
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
but they tend to be leaded and

56
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,799
non-leaded non-leaded tends to be silver

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,759
there's flux

58
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,439
in the core of these we'll talk more

59
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,680
about flux but it's the chemical that

60
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,479
keeps the

61
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,960
joint activated correctly during the

62
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,399
heat cycle so that it doesn't oxidize

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,479
here's what the paste comes in that's a

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,719
that's a hypodermic type needle

65
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,799
with a plunger and various needles i can

66
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,600
fit to here

67
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,840
but the paste is in there it is a paste

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,800
just like we're saying

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,520
with the flux moved in now there's a

70
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
couple different kinds of fluxes

71
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
and i'm not even talking about leaded

72
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
versus non-leaded for a second

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
uh but for both leaded and non-leaded we

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,560
have

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,560
uh the the regular standard rosin flux

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
we have water soluble fluxes which means

77
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,879
you can wash them in a washing machine

78
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,800
with the right kind of deionized water

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
and that gets used in production

80
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
i use something called no clean which

81
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,440
tends to be an alcohol-based solvent

82
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
uh with some other chemicals thrown in

83
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,920
uh what i call the magic juju to make

84
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,959
that work

85
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,080
so um very right off the bat pick a

86
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
technology i use the no clean

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
technology i use it both in my fluxes

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
these days fluxes i use on my bench

89
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
the paste i use when i do my own surface

90
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,920
mount here's a close-up of the

91
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,159
syringes that the paste come in there's

92
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,400
three different brands here and

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
you'll need the the plunger to go along

94
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,879
with it

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,959
and the needle to go along with it so

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
let me show you how i

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
uh store my plungers here's one of my

98
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,840
containers that i keep an assortment of

99
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
things to help me with my solder paste

100
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
i have a selection of needle sizes and

101
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
these are

102
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,799
sorted by size written on the inside of

103
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,599
the container here

104
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,560
i also have different fluxes lots of

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
different fluxes different ways of

106
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,200
scooping and

107
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,560
and slobbering uh solder paste around

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,959
and then i also keep in here the little

109
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,599
smaller

110
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,920
uh picker uppers you can see the little

111
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,239
suction real tiny suction head here's a

112
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,599
bigger suction head

113
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,839
so i keep those in this container

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
in this container i keep a selection of

115
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,239
the syringes themselves the caps that go

116
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,599
on the ends

117
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
uh this is actually a hose this plugs

118
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,640
into the back of a syringe and applies

119
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
pressure this is for

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,959
a solder dispenser that i'll talk about

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,560
more but i don't use

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,200
i prefer solder paste masks you're going

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,798
to hear me say solder mask

124
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,599
paste masks

125
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,040
so real quick but a thing about solder

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
paste storage

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,479
is this solder paste is volatile the

128
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,240
fluxes leave it

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,440
quickly if you can't store this for a

130
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
week you really can't i use a

131
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,639
refrigerator store mine

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
but i use a paste called zephyr paste

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,080
which the guy

134
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,440
david zee formulated this to have a

135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,479
better shelf life

136
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
no i don't work for them but i use this

137
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
product otherwise if you get your solder

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,000
paste

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880
from places uh sr solder i get it from

140
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
various places

141
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
if you can't remember when you bought

142
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,240
your solder throw it away it's too old

143
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
if you bought it last week it might be

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
too old if it's got a scum

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,199
on the top it's too old the consistency

146
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,880
of the solder paste in production is

147
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,320
paramount they warm it to the right

148
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,199
temperature

149
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,880
they they make sure it's the right date

150
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
they keep it sealed

151
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,280
i keep it sealed in the syringes and

152
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,120
there's actually a hanger for this in my

153
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,600
uh

154
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
in my little refrigerator these cheap

155
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
little things don't put this in your

156
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,440
break room refrigerator is lead in it

157
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,199
there's other chemicals

158
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
you store it like this so that there's

159
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
not a chance for a skin

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
skin to form so the plunger is in here

161
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
and we pull the paste out of the bottom

162
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,160
and so

163
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
these this just the worst paste part

164
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,199
about the paste

165
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,280
you almost got to buy it before you use

166
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
it or get a longer lasting paste

167
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,240
and then store it in a refrigerated

168
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
environment and preferably

169
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
non-condensing these things condensed

170
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,080
psyche

171
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,400
i have to open it and wipe the water out

172
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
of it every now and then

173
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
here i threw some of the solder paste

174
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,600
under my microscope here

175
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
and you can see the tiny little uh

176
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,759
granules of the metal and they're being

177
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,400
held

178
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
in place by flux and and you can see the

179
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,960
surface tension here

180
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,039
as this is drying out and believe me

181
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,520
it's drying out even as it sits here

182
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,759
so this is what it looks like beforehand

183
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,120
if you have a bad

184
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
solder uh what you'll find is these

185
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
granules clump together and they become

186
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,240
more grapey

187
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
looking no they're not grape size but

188
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,000
they look grapey when you look at them

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
under uh magnification

190
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,199
so but this is pre-soldered solder

191
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,280
so let's talk about surface mount

192
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
technologies for a second because

193
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,520
what i'm showing here is a very small

194
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
one that's not the right one

195
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
i'm showing a very small one on oh 50

196
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
centers

197
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,160
and and the reason this is so small is

198
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
i'm trying to insert

199
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
a board between literally this board

200
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,199
which is complex

201
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,639
itself between here and here i'm

202
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,240
sticking a whole level of trait level

203
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,759
translators actually

204
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,280
i like to be able to convert from 3

205
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
volts to 1.8 to 5 volts and so i built

206
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,800
this little board

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,479
that fits right in between those two

208
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,319
things to do that

209
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,840
so um i would i cannot hand solder

210
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
something that small but let's talk

211
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
about hand soldering

212
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
you can hand solder this i've done many

213
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,000
many of

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
some smt point one inch centers sot

215
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,919
devices

216
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,039
soic i'm not going to show you here but

217
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,520
you can hand solder those

218
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,080
on the topic of hand soldering or even

219
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
soldering like we're going to show here

220
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,880
today let's talk about

221
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
sizes when i say oh 50 centers those are

222
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
those little tiny dinky things point one

223
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,039
is the one you're used to seeing about

224
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:31,919
in dips

225
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,199
there's a sizing out there 0603 0805

226
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
1206 those represent the families of

227
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,280
sizes

228
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,759
generally just think of it that way i

229
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,400
don't go smaller than o603 for what

230
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,919
i do here in the bench i can go 0402 i

231
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,840
just don't need the aggravation

232
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,400
and 0805 i just it's a little too big

233
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
for me i might do leds in that size

234
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
then ceramic i'm sorry electrolytic caps

235
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,479
those those have their own sizing things

236
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,639
a b c d other other footprint oddities

237
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,919
so um so i tend to do 0.603 and with

238
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,960
that i can

239
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
almost hand solder them but again i use

240
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
a technique for laying the paste down in

241
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,479
an orderly fashion

242
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,639
here's a ruler from adafruit actually

243
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,520
that shows

244
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
uh some of the different smt sizes a lot

245
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
of people make these rulers this one

246
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
happens to be adafruits

247
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,919
and i'm going to show you a close-up i

248
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,680
wanted you to see the size of the ruler

249
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,720
so that you get a sense of scale here

250
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
so here's the point five inch

251
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,039
0.05 that i'm talking about being able

252
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,200
to do there's even smaller 0.04

253
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,839
i probably doom i haven't done them

254
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,839
using my own techniques before

255
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
and then you get to size like this and

256
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,640
they're just positively doable

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
using the techniques here i'm showing

258
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
today here's different sizes

259
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,600
of smt parts and so you can see the

260
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,959
0.603

261
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
is down around this size here that i use

262
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
you can see with my tweezers that's very

263
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
grabbable

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
here's the different size capacitors i

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,680
was talking about whoops is that them

266
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,560
there's a b

267
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
c these are oddball shapes

268
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,000
but when i say o603 i'm talking about

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
devices typically this size you see the

270
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,959
next step down is

271
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,680
is i'm sorry right there so 603. next

272
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,000
step down is getting pretty hard to grab

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
and then you get to 201 you actually

274
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,279
have to watch that you don't

275
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,000
accidentally

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
inhale them now

277
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,839
one way to do solder paste would be to

278
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
actually

279
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,120
leave a trail of paste using a syringe

280
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,959
down the line where it's thin enough

281
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,360
that when the solder melts it pulls away

282
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
and just collapses around the pins due

283
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
to surface tension

284
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,120
another way is a

285
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,920
solder dispenser i do not use this i try

286
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,760
to use this i don't like it

287
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,160
has a foot switch it has an air source

288
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,399
step on the foot switch

289
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,560
and it puts pressure on your syringe

290
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,040
what it is is the pipe

291
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,279
you get some tubing tubing leads to the

292
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,560
back of this wrench

293
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
this thing runs when you step on the

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,079
foot switch and it forces paste out of

295
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,279
the syringe

296
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,920
um problem i have is when you go to put

297
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,399
that

298
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
on the board right where you want it it

299
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,720
doesn't always wet

300
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,640
and stick to the board sometimes it

301
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
comes up on the needle and now i've got

302
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
a double load for the next pad

303
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
cleaning the board is essential to all

304
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
of this anyways and my board was clean

305
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
when i used to try that

306
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,760
but i've skipped that step that said

307
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
before we put solder paste down we clean

308
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,040
it i use 100

309
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
alcohol i use some other critters too

310
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,079
around here

311
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,560
um but again i couldn't get this to

312
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,399
stick let me show you what i do

313
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,760
use this is a stencil you can get these

314
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,279
at the same time

315
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
3d house of stencil you can get these

316
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
made at the same time

317
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,440
as you get your pc boards fab it's from

318
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
the same files they add they do add a

319
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
paste file

320
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
you can figure these out without them

321
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
you can figure them out from just an

322
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,120
eagle board for example

323
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,680
but this is a solder mask without a

324
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,480
frame

325
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,880
and you can actually apply lay this on

326
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,839
top of a board

327
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,600
right and you squeegee solder paste

328
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,560
through it

329
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
all right you take something like this

330
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,079
hey here's the nosh stencil

331
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,360
uh solder paste spreader credit card

332
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
size thing and what you do is you'll

333
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
squeegee the paste through

334
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
so that wherever these holes align the

335
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
paste will go through and land up on

336
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
your board

337
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,079
i don't use these might my hand shake

338
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,079
too much i usually tend to work on in

339
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
ways that i'm used to from production

340
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
i don't use them without frames let me

341
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,839
show you what i mean by a solder

342
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,760
paste screen paste screen with a frame

343
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,639
and a frame holder so i've decided to

344
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,200
show you

345
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
the actual stencil paste

346
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
process here here's the frame holding or

347
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,240
being held in the

348
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
stencil frame and the pc board is

349
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,839
underneath here

350
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,839
and the idea here is that we're probably

351
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,920
going to do off camera is we use

352
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
pc boards to shove it into place or we

353
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,440
can either

354
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
unscrew the the clamps that hold this

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and move the stencil into place

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
here is a stencil

357
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
tie is a drum they stretch these this is

358
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,720
a stencil in a frame

359
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,360
these come in somewhat standard sizes

360
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,040
and they fit my stencil holder i'm going

361
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,279
to show you in a second but basically

362
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,279
uh it's the little core here is the

363
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,720
holes in it and you can get this

364
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,519
panelized

365
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,680
so let's say instead of doing one of

366
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
these where you do the solder paste per

367
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,160
per board you can do it to the whole

368
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
board to a whole panel and do 20 or 30

369
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,760
boards at once

370
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
but for here in my lab i just generally

371
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,519
shoot one right in the center

372
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,519
this is a frame stencil sells frameless

373
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,800
frames something like that

374
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,760
um i get my spraying stencils again from

375
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
the same place i get my pc boards from

376
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,959
overseas

377
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,560
uh actually just costs a little more to

378
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
ship them than the boards but uh

379
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,079
they're these are inexpensive as well

380
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
here is a stencil machine you can see

381
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,880
it's counter levered

382
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,079
and what we do put that down

383
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,720
is we put the board we want a solder

384
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
paste under here

385
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
and then we'll squeegee remember credit

386
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,760
card

387
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,680
we'll put a line of solder paste here

388
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,639
and then squeegee it across those holes

389
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
and it'll it's like silk screening it'll

390
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
put the paste into the pattern

391
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,320
on the pc board now

392
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
i use something a little better this

393
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,440
actually came

394
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,480
with my solder frame

395
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,560
um this looks like just a piece of hard

396
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
plastic

397
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,160
kind of two pieces this actually bends a

398
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,959
little bit

399
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,920
and when i squeegee using this it gives

400
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,880
just enough

401
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
that the solder paste gets pushed

402
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,639
through the holes without smearing

403
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,360
and getting under it if you press down

404
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
real hard

405
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,720
while you're doing this it'll push too

406
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
much paste through and then when

407
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,240
you lift this up the board will stick to

408
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
the bottom if the board sticks to the

409
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,720
bottom of your frame

410
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,839
of your stencil wipe it off do it again

411
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,040
let me be real clear cleanliness

412
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,519
i said wipe it off i start by wiping

413
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,279
this thing down i actually have

414
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,279
stencil cleaner which is like you don't

415
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,040
want to drink that stuff

416
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,920
and then i'll clean the board and then

417
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
before things get dirty again i'll go

418
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
ahead and squeegee my solder paste

419
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,399
across

420
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,959
so again this takes a certain feel to it

421
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,480
as we do it

422
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
now one of the things you can do to line

423
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
up your boards is use other boards on

424
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
the sides

425
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,160
so that it when it's leveled the

426
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,920
the boards act as a holder with the

427
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
board you want in the middle so you can

428
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,320
do that

429
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
um for whether you use the frame or

430
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
non-frame a lot of people will build a

431
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,760
little barrier boards around it put the

432
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,199
board they're doing in the center that

433
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,839
way everything's level

434
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
okay very first thing i did then after

435
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,800
we did this is i cleaned my

436
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,360
solder paste screen uh all those tiny

437
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,440
holes you let solder paste form in there

438
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,160
and dry

439
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,800
uh it's a mess to clean up this is now

440
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
going under the microscope to

441
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,040
check my registration and i'm looking

442
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
for solder bridges if there's

443
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,120
already a solder bridge here you're

444
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,320
going to have a solder bridge in the

445
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,120
final product

446
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
so it's the way surface tension works um

447
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
it can be misregistered a bit

448
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
that's fine but again i'm looking for

449
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,920
even a hair or something that's got

450
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,480
solder

451
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,199
paste following it across the shorts

452
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,160
across the

453
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,839
different pads here okay so

454
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
placing parts onto this board is

455
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
critical if you look at those little

456
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,000
guys they're small right

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
well how do you pick them up

458
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,160
how do you pick them up uh and place

459
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,880
them well

460
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
tweezers tweezers first one tweezers

461
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,120
work for small parts by the way

462
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,800
if you drop a part throw it away that's

463
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
what i do because i no longer know what

464
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,240
the part is

465
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,360
uh when i i keep my parts on reels

466
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
or cut tape cut tape is simply where

467
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
you'll cut part of this off and this

468
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
will be what you buy from

469
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,360
the parts are in here and they're

470
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
contained by this tape on top

471
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,600
and this feeds through a machine well

472
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
that's good for me too

473
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
i can store a bunch of these in my reel

474
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,040
holder up here or when i buy the parts i

475
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,000
buy them on cut

476
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,720
tape i don't open them ahead of time or

477
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,160
anything i'm taking them right out of

478
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,079
the tape and putting them on the board

479
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,160
that's the only way i know the the value

480
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,120
of them

481
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,000
i saw seed studio had one of those lcr

482
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,839
tweezers where you can put it on a part

483
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,040
it'll tell you the capacitance

484
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,639
resistance inductance

485
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
and help you identify the part that's

486
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,079
that's kind of cool i wish i uh

487
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,759
uh had a pair of those around here i

488
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,199
might try them so

489
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
but here's a way to put the parts down

490
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,480
first off the manual way see that's a

491
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
little sucker

492
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,679
that actually if i were to attach that

493
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,640
to a part

494
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
you can lift the part and put it down

495
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
that's a big sucker head but they make

496
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,520
small ones

497
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,880
and it's operated right here there's a

498
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,160
automatic version this is actually

499
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,319
a suction pin oh this one's made to be a

500
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,359
suction pin you hook

501
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,799
suction to to your um to these that are

502
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,000
made for this

503
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
and you use the suction of the device to

504
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,760
to goes all the way to the little

505
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
suction head and you can pick the part

506
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
up and you usually cover all with a hole

507
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,240
in your finger

508
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,160
you'll lift it to drop the part you'll

509
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,080
place it to pick up the part

510
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,840
this didn't work so well for me i have

511
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,440
two of these um

512
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
i kind of i'm i tend to be a tweezers

513
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
kind of guy

514
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,559
or a manual solder sucker now

515
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,240
tweezers let's talk about them if you

516
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
get big flat packages

517
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,600
it's imperative that packages be flat on

518
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
the pc board

519
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,200
if you drop it pinned down first that

520
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,039
pendle pin will bend up and you end up

521
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,440
with

522
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
a bad corner of the chip so that's the

523
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,000
problem with tweezers if you pick them

524
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
up and one end goes low while you're

525
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
putting it down you can bend the leads

526
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
so you got to pick that part up flat and

527
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,080
you've got to lay it down flat

528
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,640
so now some people use these there's

529
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,559
some hackaday articles on how to convert

530
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:18,960
these

531
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
uh like i said i actually got pretty

532
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,880
good results from a

533
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,720
uh from an aquarium pump

534
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
all right it's hammer time time to put

535
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,919
this in the oven

536
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
uh again this is a converted black and

537
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,520
decker oven with

538
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,320
dei insulation all over it an additional

539
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,039
heater

540
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,559
and a control leo 3 module that runs it

541
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,760
this module learns this oven

542
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
um and i've got different configurations

543
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,679
whether i have a split plate or not in

544
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,400
here

545
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
and mainly what i'll do is i'll

546
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
recalibrate takes an hour to calibrate

547
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
this oven it means it's good right

548
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,440
um if i'm doing single runs i'm

549
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
calibrated right now for very small

550
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
quantities if i wanted to load this up

551
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
with 10

552
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,880
uh 10 pc boards i would probably stop

553
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,039
and calibrate it for 10 pc boards i'd

554
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,799
actually throw them in there

555
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,960
not with pace but just to represent the

556
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
thermal mass

557
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,760
so we insert our board into here

558
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,919
the profiles chosen for lead in this

559
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,559
case and i'm going to run the profile

560
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,120
so we actually get a little profile here

561
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,000
on the screen

562
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
and i'll show you in the article uh in

563
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,360
the post

564
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,840
uh what that the different phases of

565
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
that profile are

566
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
all right here's the view through my uh

567
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
the stereo microscope i showed you

568
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,919
and we're looking pretty good if you

569
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,919
look at that row of pads there on the

570
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,559
right

571
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
i'm not seeing any solder bridges i can

572
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
see more than the camera shows

573
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,520
it looks pretty clean but i'll inspect

574
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,799
this whole thing make sure there's no

575
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,799
solder bridges if there are solder

576
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,320
bridges i will

577
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
attempt to remove them with manual

578
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,679
desoldering process

579
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
which i have a video out here at

580
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,280
hackaday about all the different ways

581
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,240
you can desolder

582
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,799
smt so hopefully i'll try and remember

583
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,640
to link it in on the post

584
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,440
all right my last step is especially if

585
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
i'm making the board for somebody else

586
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
i clean the board i have an ultrasonic

587
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,360
cleaner i have two the other one's over

588
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
there somewhere

589
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and this will heat the fluid that's in

590
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
it and ultrasonically clean it do you

591
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,200
need to

592
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
usually not unless you're doing

593
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,039
something really high frequency or real

594
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,080
low leakage

595
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,159
and it's usually not the flux it's the

596
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,320
problem it's what gets

597
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,919
attracted to the flux we used to have a

598
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,400
problem with greasy fuzzy stuff getting

599
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,640
into our flux in the old days on analog

600
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,520
circuits

601
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,799
i do tend to clean it i use

602
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,159
number 35. i forget i researched this

603
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,000
real heavily what what i could

604
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
get for here in sizes i don't need 55

605
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
gallon drums

606
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,120
so i get mine from sra if you google

607
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
that you'll find they make soldering

608
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,600
supplies

609
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,640
so after the uh the board

610
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,679
gets soldered i'll do an inspection and

611
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,280
clean it or i do it clean it

612
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,120
cleaning and then inspect it o50 centers

613
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,240
real micro small

614
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
stuff and it worked just fine so you can

615
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,120
do

616
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,000
your own surface mount assembly at home

617
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,159
uh it starts with cleanliness

618
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,720
uh a good solder good solder paste a

619
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,600
good fresh

620
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
solder paste you also mix it up real

621
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,799
good you don't

622
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,799
you don't put to let the skin get into

623
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,400
it like i said if you got a skin on it

624
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
it's probably no good anyways

625
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
you stick it through a mask of sort you

626
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
either put it down with a solder

627
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
dispenser

628
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,520
or make it be your own solder dispenser

629
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,720
with a syringe

630
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,200
my son's real good at that or you use a

631
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,799
solder mask

632
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,520
paste mask and you squeegee across it

633
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,440
and that puts the solder right onto the

634
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,159
board

635
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,960
we then get it in we then inspect it

636
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,559
make sure there's no if there's a little

637
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,280
sloppy

638
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,400
solder trail wipe it off start again and

639
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,360
that usually

640
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,039
you'll see it you'll you'll see the

641
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,640
issues that would have been problems if

642
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,960
you inspect it between those two steps

643
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
then uh we get it into the oven i don't

644
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,159
know if i said that and then in the

645
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,120
cleaning

646
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
so uh hopefully this showed all the

647
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,120
steps you would need to do this yourself

648
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,080
again i

649
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,799
use 0.603 because size components just

650
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,520
fine

651
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
i make sure my components are on cut

652
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
tape i like to have reels of the common

653
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
components

654
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
and boy we can turn out our own boards

655
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,799
that we could only have dreamed of in

656
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,919
the old days you can do

657
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,080
from home with just a few pieces of

658
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,960
equipment

659
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,280
so bill heard from hackaday hopefully

660
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,159
this helped you

661
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,919
get over the fear of doing your own

662
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,240
surface mount assembly if nothing else

663
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,480
uh you know i know i went too fast to

664
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
actually see it but know those steps

665
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,640
know that inspection helps know that

666
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,320
your paste is like

667
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,120
it all important and right behind that

668
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,200
is a good decent oven and again this is

669
