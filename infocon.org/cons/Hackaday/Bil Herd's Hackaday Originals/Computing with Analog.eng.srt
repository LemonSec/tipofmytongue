1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,480
they'll heard from hackaday today we're

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,390
going to be doing analog computing this

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,200
is not the math to do analog it is using

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,860
analog to do the math so I'm going to

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,529
use my little breadboard here to do some

6
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,720
addition some division maybe some square

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,449
roots maybe some multiplication and if

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,189
we have time we'll show an application

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,160
maybe we'll get involved with a balanced

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,660
ring modulators and things like that

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,029
which are multiplication of a audio

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,460
signal so but first let's get started

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,860
let's look at just adding some numbers

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,870
together and summing and we all know

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,210
about op amps and that's what they do so

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,190
we're going to flip right on through

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,190
that part here's my little analog

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,800
breadboard set up and I make a little

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,930
small PC boards when I want to do analog

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,840
or even some digital I'm instead of

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,420
trying to do the solderless breadboards

22
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,190
parsley for layout purposes but also

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,260
then that gives me the opportunity I can

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,050
put the formulas right on there and the

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,280
picture of what it looks like and

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,989
hopefully get a better intuitive feel of

27
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,090
what's going on so in this case we're

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,890
looking at an inverting summing

29
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,380
amplifier summing that you know addition

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,320
so that's our block diagram for the

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,299
invert invert summing amplifier and

32
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,229
again I'm not going to go through the

33
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,630
math of it but what you're doing is

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,390
you're looking for ratios so in this

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,310
case you've got the ratio of the inputs

36
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,100
to the output if you look on the on the

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,070
drawing there you'll see those and the

38
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,829
answer will be a negative number so if I

39
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,320
want to do addition using this I would

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,119
dial in 3 volts there's an adjustment

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,220
here and for the second one for example

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,430
I would dial in point 5 and then I would

43
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,409
get my answer so right now it's a 3.0 1

44
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,049
plus 0.5 and the answer is 3 point 5 1 I

45
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,680
can also use it to solve subtraction if

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,229
I take this value here and I change this

47
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,180
number here I'll read the answer on the

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,149
one below it so and and so I'm just

49
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,860
using the volt meters as a digital

50
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,110
display of the voltage we actually

51
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,479
cannot do this without displays if we

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,520
use calibrated vernier knobs like this

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,800
one and this is a 10 turn pot with a

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,080
vernier knob on it

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,450
so and or or you could use regular knob

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,060
and just have a big graph around almost

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,070
like the old RF generator is how they

58
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,250
had all the scales around it so now this

59
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,140
does addition as you might think doing

60
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,320
this and while I'm adjusting this you'll

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,060
notice there's not a lot of crosstalk

62
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,180
the 0.5 is staying pretty stable and if

63
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,910
we bring up the block diagram for this

64
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,000
we see that this is an inverting summing

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,950
and right here is a virtual ground and

66
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,430
what that means is that the 3 inputs

67
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,320
have a very little crosstalk because

68
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,970
they're isolated they have to go through

69
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,740
ground to get to the other one and so

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,720
this is a good way to do a summing

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,530
amplifier to to reduce crosstalk and you

72
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,060
would use this for audio and the like

73
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,100
well what do we mean by a virtual ground

74
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,940
well this pin the input pin is at a

75
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,830
ground reference but there's no current

76
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,780
flowing into the pin if you can dig it

77
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,870
the the theory is that the amount of

78
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,350
current entering the pin and entering

79
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,020
the node and exiting are equal so

80
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,959
there's a sum of 0 and that's a virtual

81
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,690
ground huh what's that mean well picture

82
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,170
two people about to kick a soccer ball

83
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,000
and they kick it right at the exact same

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,880
time right from two different sites and

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,100
they boom they kick it and it doesn't

86
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,140
move because they had equal and opposite

87
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,390
current flows or the amount of energy

88
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,820
that their leg imparted to it and if you

89
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,620
were an observer it looked to you like

90
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,750
the soccer ball was rooted in the ground

91
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,430
like stuck to the ground because both

92
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,080
guys kicked it and didn't getting where

93
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,880
well it's the same thing here it looks

94
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,010
like ground it acts like ground but

95
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,380
there's no current flow to ground and I

96
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,730
believe this was also called

97
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,940
superposition in the in the math part of

98
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,150
it but this is a good a good way to do

99
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,580
your summing amplifier let's look at the

100
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,950
alternative of a non-inverting summing

101
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,459
amplifier

102
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,800
I've talked out the inverting some

103
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,910
summing amplifier and put in its place a

104
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,760
non-inverting summing amplifier and it

105
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,149
looks like this it the the inputs are

106
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,250
now going into the non-inverting input

107
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,720
as you can see here it would looks up

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,290
like this

109
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,660
and the first thing you will notice as I

110
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,790
go to adjustable teach now in this is

111
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,920
that there's crosstalk going on the

112
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,080
voltages are interacting with each other

113
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,770
and that's that's uh because of the the

114
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,930
way the summing amplifier works in this

115
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,620
case the there is no virtual ground this

116
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,600
is a high input impedance into the

117
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,230
op-amp and so this signal can see this

118
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,560
signal in this case to KL a 2000 ohms

119
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,870
away and it didn't stop at ground first

120
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,450
so I didn't need my little inverting

121
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,490
amplifier on the follow up here to make

122
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,710
the display work correctly before when

123
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,060
it was inverting it would have been a

124
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,410
negative number so I put it through

125
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,970
another inverting just to bring it back

126
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,670
for the digital so we just showed how to

127
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,820
add and we can also do something else

128
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,680
I'm just going to tell you about it but

129
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,440
we can also determine average as you saw

130
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,060
in those amplifiers there's a certain

131
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,010
amount of gain well if we change the

132
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,750
gain if we say oh there's three inputs

133
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,420
divide the total by three now I've got

134
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,180
an averaging circuit so with just an

135
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,180
op-amp and some inputs now I can do

136
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,360
addition and averaging well you can also

137
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,220
multiply if you really want to know and

138
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,170
that is the way we used to multiply with

139
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,770
logarithms with slide rule and basically

140
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,750
what it is is the addition of two

141
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,900
logarithms is the same as multiplying in

142
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,930
in normal decimal format so we could

143
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,120
have if we were using the knobs we could

144
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,850
have the knobs be calibrated in

145
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,290
logarithms you could photocopy the slide

146
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,550
rule and Photoshop it into a curve and

147
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,070
then it could be the the legend around a

148
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,980
knob for example so let's move on and

149
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,320
talk about some other things we can do

150
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,930
with analog computation I just plugged

151
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,200
in my multiplier the ad 6:33 and it

152
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,730
actually came right up let me show you

153
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,010
what we're looking at here so I've added

154
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,820
this stage up here and this is the 633

155
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,070
it's a four quadrant multiplier but we

156
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,770
only use two of the inputs for it and it

157
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,990
took two volts and two volts now you

158
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,160
know they're flickering around a little

159
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,690
bit and came up with four volts I

160
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,289
actually came up with point four ball

161
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,599
cults so I routed it through this change

162
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,849
one resistor to make a gain of ten and

163
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,949
now I can read it as four volts so it's

164
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,869
been normalized back to or scaled back

165
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:51,619
to you know this unitless value whatever

166
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,740
we're working with here as I mentioned

167
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,360
before the device we're using as an

168
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,539
analog device is 633 and it's a cool

169
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,629
little chip it takes care of all the

170
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,689
trimming trimming of the logarithm

171
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:07,039
getting into the dynamic range of the

172
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,979
logarithmic part of the nonlinear parts

173
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,589
so that we can use it you know I've had

174
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,180
this thing up to nine volts it actually

175
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,759
got a little uh got a little off and

176
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,740
doing so considering the wires are

177
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,189
laying all over that one bad so easy to

178
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,869
use part if we look in the center

179
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:26,330
there's a multiplication going on in the

180
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,939
center and two amps feeding it which

181
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:32,089
right now I've got the negative inputs

182
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:34,639
tied to ground I actually an artificial

183
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,520
ground in between the two power rails

184
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,409
but you could use as a differential into

185
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:40,580
it and you see it's got a buffered

186
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,039
output and then the Z output which is so

187
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,839
you can sum in an offset so let's say oh

188
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,430
that's great but I want the answer to be

189
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,709
a minimum of two volts you would give it

190
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,289
an offset of two volts on its z pin so

191
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:53,509
well this was a DC test direct current

192
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,349
test uh the what I'd like to do is show

193
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,839
you some AC applications of this so you

194
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,729
know let's see what we can do with a

195
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,919
little bit of frequency so let me turn

196
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,189
down again and show you that here we are

197
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,860
with the final circuit for this week's

198
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,369
video we've now crossed from doing

199
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,680
things with DC direct current into

200
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,229
things with AC alternating current or in

201
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,719
this case an audio tone and so what I

202
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:23,959
have is I've got my little inner silt

203
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,849
that's obsolete now you have to give

204
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,740
them off eBay eight zero three eight

205
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,800
it's a function generator it does a sine

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,750
triangle and square wave all in one

207
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,500
package it's very cool and and also then

208
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,009
I built a little keyboard PCB for it so

209
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,990
that you can have like a little organ

210
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,649
here and so here's the ad 6:33 here's

211
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,680
the tone generator here's the keyboard

212
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,670
for it

213
00:08:52,670 --> 00:09:02,780
and so now let's show you and and that's

214
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,250
the way form what it looks like what

215
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,290
you're seeing there is just just the

216
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,630
something mimicking the attack sustain

217
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,620
decay delay release of say a synthesizer

218
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,380
but if we give it a tone you'll see that

219
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,490
it actually starts to now modulate that

220
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,100
so we're amplitude modulating this or in

221
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,730
other words where we are creating a

222
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,520
voltage controlled gain block or we can

223
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,850
do things like automatic gain control

224
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,710
using the multiplier so we're now we're

225
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,280
starting to branch out in applications

226
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,410
more than just you know doing some on

227
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,580
the bench computation for fun I'm going

228
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,830
to stop there for this video and I'm

229
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,410
going to go into a the AC fundamentals

230
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,250
of the multiplier on next time so with

231
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,070
an analog multiplier I can do things

232
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,040
like amplitude modulate a signal radio

233
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,790
signal I can do the volume modulation I

234
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,560
can do a voltage controlled amplifier

235
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,160
and with my little keypad here my little

236
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,500
oscillator got the beginnings of an

237
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,220
analog synthesizer here so and it also

238
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,170
does one other thing and I was nuts

239
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,690
about this in the seventies the whoops

240
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,400
knows the ring oscillator a balance

241
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,640
modulator was one of the few nonlinear

242
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
components we had remember everything is

243
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,320
monotonic we just had one tone if you

244
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,640
heard more than one tone back then it

245
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,170
was either guys playing multiple

246
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,720
keyboards like keith emerson or he was

247
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,280
playing an organ again like keith

248
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,830
emerson but one of the things we could

249
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,750
do was we can multiply a couple signals

250
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,640
together and we get like a Gong sound or

251
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,680
if you did it just right it sounded kind

252
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,140
of like a honky-tonk piano or something

253
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,580
so we'll get into the AC fundamentals of

254
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,630
of F multipliers next time so I hope you

255
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,320
caught on while I was talking about with

256
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,430
analog computation computing with analog

257
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,100
like I said it came first

258
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,380
long before the

259
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,260
digital calculators so bill heard on

260
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,530
behalf of hackaday see you around
