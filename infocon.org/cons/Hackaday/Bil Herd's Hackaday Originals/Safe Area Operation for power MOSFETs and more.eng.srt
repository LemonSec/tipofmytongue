1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
hi bill heard from hackaday here today

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,149
we're going to learn what

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,549
radio-controlled tanks power transistors

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:07,919
power MOSFETs and helicopters have in

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,639
common

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,590
why helicopters you might ask well

7
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,509
they're in my blood I got around him in

8
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,250
a cavalry unit in the service and then I

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,630
was in a medical battalion in the

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,670
service and then later on in life I

11
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,380
worked at trauma center and were

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,029
unloading all the helicopters in South

13
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,160
Jersey so you think it gets in your

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,140
blood but one of the things I learned

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,470
while I was learning the fly was what we

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,720
call the height philosophy diagram R or

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,520
as commonly know the dead man's curve

18
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,219
and what that says is you can't just fly

19
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,230
at any height at any speed unless you're

20
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,050
being shot at to have a safe area of

21
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,420
operation you need to be high up if

22
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,100
you're going slow that way if the engine

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,450
gives out you can convert that energy

24
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,030
into the blades called Auto rotation or

25
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,160
if you're low then you need to be going

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,780
fast so again you'll go and convert the

27
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,820
forward speed into auto rotation and

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,160
land so this area where we're allowed to

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,199
fly is called the safe area operation

30
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,420
guess what today's video is about we're

31
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,859
going to talk about safe area operation

32
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,930
and transistors and MOSFETs and other

33
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,010
links so okay so let's talk about a

34
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,110
power transistor for a second we might

35
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,110
be familiar with them let's think of it

36
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,570
as a switch if we've got it turned off

37
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,820
there's no power consumption because

38
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,340
zero current times whatever voltage 12

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,220
volts let's say there's no power concern

40
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,979
so a switch off great let's think of it

41
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,350
as a switch turned on still we're very

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,020
good it's inside a safe area operation

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,820
if you want to think about it but we get

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,470
into trouble if we get into the middle

45
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,229
somewhere between on and off we get

46
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,869
we're in the linear region and we may

47
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,880
have left the safe area operation why

48
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,350
would you have a transistor in the

49
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,090
linear area well a linear voltage

50
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,939
regulator like an L do that's an example

51
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,970
or an audio amplifier audio amplifiers

52
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,340
don't cut on and off at least there's

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,640
some but let's not talk about those they

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,890
have to work in the linear region so

55
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,229
that's our safe area operation is

56
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,030
understanding the Deadman's curve of

57
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,590
transistors if you want to think about

58
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,780
it how to keep it from melting down and

59
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,910
heating okay here's a safe area

60
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,280
operation of both the transistor and a

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,040
power MOSFET what you see here is a

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,870
a lot alike they both share the same

63
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,120
parameters for the same characteristics

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,459
for off to the left is a little bit of

65
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,290
voltage lots of current off to the right

66
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,480
is a little bit of current but lots of

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,060
voltage and we're okay at those two

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,739
extremes but it's in the middle that we

69
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,269
have to watch out for our safe area

70
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,250
operation and again there's two kinds of

71
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,439
safe area operation there's temperature

72
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,879
or thermal which we talked a little bit

73
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,920
about already and there's the power

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,420
based one which is what we're talking

75
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,180
here now you look at the transistor it's

76
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,549
got one additional failure mode it's got

77
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:47,129
the secondary breakdown and what that is

78
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,349
is that's actually the the physics of

79
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,840
the bond wire and the base connection in

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,879
the collector connection where they get

81
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,980
too hot it's a point heat or a pin point

82
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,139
heat and actually will break the dye and

83
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,060
stress the dye and it's a lot like if

84
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,819
you put a roll car into a put a roll

85
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,730
cage into a car and you go to use it

86
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,439
also it does is punch holes in the

87
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,480
chassis that's kind of what's going on

88
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,900
though

89
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,260
okay real quick I just wanted to show

90
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,959
this so that you knew that there are

91
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,459
time trade-offs a lot of times you'll

92
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,769
see this on the graphs and here you'll

93
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,769
see the from DC steady on in red all the

94
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,720
way up to the corner where if you post

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,030
it at 100 microseconds you know now you

96
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,590
know you're up around a hundred amps

97
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,760
instead of down around two so I know you

98
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,400
got to be asking about out so what's

99
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,840
this have to do with radio-controlled

100
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,549
tanks other than Bill's kind of

101
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,729
infatuated with remote-control tanks and

102
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,769
it's true I used to crew a tank back in

103
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,739
the 1970s called an m60 a one they get

104
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,680
you're getting your blood stream too but

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,949
I bought this tank in about 30 years ago

106
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,349
in Tokyo while there for Commodore

107
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:57,479
Business Machines and back then we

108
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,760
didn't have switching MOSFETs and so you

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,159
know I will talk about hex vets and and

110
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,959
how MOSFET suddenly could handle power

111
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,030
but back then we just didn't have them

112
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,519
so the way the motor speed is controlled

113
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,680
is by this low wiper on what is

114
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,370
essentially a power resistor with the

115
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,279
insulation torn off on one side so this

116
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,728
will swing back and forth choosing areas

117
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,610
of speed now it's got a safe ferry

118
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,169
operation you can get this in the right

119
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,840
spot where maybe the motor stall and

120
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,550
you got too much voltage too much

121
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,830
current and the power being dissipated

122
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,630
by this is high and it's a trade-off

123
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,669
they why would they do that well it

124
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,440
works most of the plate positions just

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,190
not all and so if we look here there's

126
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,560
the hole it melted jeez 15 20 years ago

127
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,930
before I put the switcher in the herbs

128
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,520
before I put the modern device in there

129
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,490
now I was going to actually power up the

130
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,820
the power resistor here and show you the

131
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,410
heating cycle I thought that stupid just

132
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,169
take my word for it so you know here's

133
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,090
how I would have measured it like I've

134
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,419
got a fluke adapter and then a

135
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,919
thermocouple it's probably a too

136
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,070
dissimilar metal thermocouple and then

137
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,490
you all have seen these I'm sure this is

138
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,340
just one of those little infrared things

139
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,900
where it sends a lot of light to

140
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,300
whatever you're measuring and we all

141
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,030
know that's that light's not doing the

142
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,380
measuring that's just a pointing device

143
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,660
to tell you right so it's not modulating

144
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,220
the return light I thought that at one

145
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,260
time all right I want to go over just a

146
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,700
little bit of math and then we're out of

147
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,550
here quite quite simply what I have is

148
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,710
the safe area operating grant and I'm

149
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,450
just showing that if you have 10 amps at

150
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,520
one point 1 volt way up here in the

151
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,349
corner where it's you know turned on and

152
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,750
running that's only about a watt and

153
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,550
down here same thing if I take the

154
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,669
opposite of it the reciprocal 0.1 amp 10

155
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,210
volts 1 a.m. so or 1 watt I'm sorry so

156
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,849
this shows the on and off are easy to do

157
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:59,789
low power dissipation here in the middle

158
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,729
harder to do higher power dissipation 5

159
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,240
volts times 5 amps equals 25 watts

160
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,960
matter of fact I'll show you how to

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,700
someday how to combine a switching

162
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,190
supply in a linear supply to reduce the

163
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,430
load for everybody we also have one more

164
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,440
devil in the details so I just wanted to

165
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,970
bring that one out make sure we're all

166
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,370
aware of it that is if we do Ohm's law

167
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,849
and we end up with P equals I squared R

168
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,380
what that saying is the current squared

169
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,970
times the resistance is the power

170
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,610
dissipated in a resistive load and if I

171
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,610
take a common MOSFET the RL 540 which is

172
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,280
a logic level gate I love that one it's

173
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,740
got an on resistance when it's turned on

174
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,710
it becomes all the way down to point O 8

175
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,610
ohms what

176
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,770
it's okay it's not great but it's it's

177
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,780
okay well let's look out well it does

178
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,470
mm-hmm so if we give it one amp punch

179
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,509
play no 8 ohms where it's still at point

180
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,759
o 8 Watts because 1 times 1 times 0.08

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,979
so as we do that multiplication we see

182
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,780
at 5 amps 2 Watts now that little

183
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,280
heatsink we were talking about last

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,379
video makes sense hey I can do 5 amps

185
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,990
and then 8 amps and tinium but what

186
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,659
happens if we make it be 1 ohm silly

187
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,610
little own the difference' no makes and

188
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,759
the RDS on the resistance drain source

189
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,000
on if we do the math again we'll see we

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,879
have 1 watt and then 25 watts for the 5

191
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,039
amps and then 64 and a hundred so

192
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,729
instead of 8 it's 100 instead of 5 at 64

193
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,860
Watts so we find that a little bit of

194
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,199
resistance gets really hammered because

195
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,840
of the I square part of it that's why

196
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,539
your high power lines are high voltage

197
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:34,979
and low current instead of the other way

198
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,500
around and it's also why your dryer at

199
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,289
home runs off to 20 most of the time

200
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,759
and while I've got you thinking about

201
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,430
the are on versus linear I want to show

202
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,050
you just one last little thing here and

203
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,509
that is I've drawn a CMOS gate I didn't

204
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,129
try and show the P channel in town I'm

205
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,379
just showing it logically this is an

206
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,960
inverter where there's a bubble here not

207
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,150
here so ad will turn on one of these

208
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,550
devices the logic level at D will turn

209
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,199
on one of these devices turn off the

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,089
other one and then when it flips to the

211
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,520
other state they trade places the

212
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,490
thinking there is that well two of these

213
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,099
are not on at the same time one is on or

214
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,509
the other ones on and so there's very

215
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,029
low leakage current so sitting still

216
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,860
there's very little power draw

217
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,199
especially CMOS it's it's this gates

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,599
really insulated not a lot of current

219
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,270
going on the problem starts when you

220
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,900
start I oscillating this or making it go

221
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,060
high and low the faster you do that the

222
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,860
more time it spends crossing each other

223
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,539
in the linear zone especially you get

224
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,969
some capacitance out here and that

225
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,860
capacitance can be felt on the gate in

226
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,440
here and that quite simply is why the

227
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,399
CPU in your computer the faster you run

228
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
at the hotter it gets because this you

229
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,880
know now you're doing a gigahertz

230
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,500
they're criss crossing all the time

231
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,720
whereas if you stopped it dead it would

232
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,730
pull very little current so you might be

233
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,090
wondering about now

234
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,340
well why it's a ferry operation what's

235
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,050
that mean why are we talking about it

236
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,090
well we're going to slide our way into

237
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,970
talking about power supplies here in the

238
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,400
future a linear supply versus a switch

239
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,500
supply and the linear something the size

240
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,330
can do a one or two amps one or two

241
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,850
watts or we can do a switching supply

242
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,860
and probably get six amps out of the

243
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,110
same footprint here now it's it's got

244
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,880
you know there's differences there's an

245
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,529
inductor we have to store their energy

246
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,529
in and things like that but that's

247
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,210
pretty cool that's we didn't have these

248
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,830
when I was coming up the switcher

249
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,110
supplies so with that said Bill heard

250
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,970
from hackaday and keep hacking
