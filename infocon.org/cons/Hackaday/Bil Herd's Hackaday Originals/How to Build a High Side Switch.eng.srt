1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,609
bill heard from hackaday today we're

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,080
going to take some of what I've been

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,820
talking about I want to show you a small

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,340
circuit called a high side switch now

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,200
this the circuits like one of the tools

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,670
you want to put in your toolbox as a

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,190
designer it's got a time in a place when

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,779
it's useful it's got time in a place

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,340
when it's not and we'll talk about those

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,220
differences so high side switches we're

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,590
going to do it simple all right let me

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,449
start by tone you first what a high side

13
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,529
switch is it switches the VCC the the

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,250
voltage that is highest in digital

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,800
electronics and some analog we're real

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,450
comfortable switching the bottom if you

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,090
ever see it open collector outputs we

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,340
pull the ground ground is a known entity

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,710
it's usually low impedance usually low

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,010
noise and so we do a lot of connecting

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,449
the ground to something to turn it on

22
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,610
there's times when you want to actually

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,469
turn the power on to something what

24
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,329
might be some of those times well on

25
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,820
let's say that you have a low current

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,399
assembly that battery-powered and you

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,319
want it to stay running but meanwhile

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,180
that maybe there's a sensor or something

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,380
I know right

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,439
that uses too much power to lead turned

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,450
on well I want to be able using an i/o

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,909
pin to enable the power to that or

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,090
disable the power to that to do that I

34
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,460
want to make sure I give it a good

35
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,560
supply usually sometimes you don't need

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,360
to but I'm going to want to give it a

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,090
voltage may be very very similar to the

38
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,500
voltage that I have to work with what if

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,030
I want to give 5 volts and I've only got

40
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,490
5 volts so I don't have 12 to 5 or 5 to

41
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,189
3 what if I I may need to keep it low

42
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,869
impedance we don't need the voltage on

43
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,900
the sensor changing its output based on

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,750
how much current it draws ok you'll get

45
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,360
erroneous results so we need something

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,570
that allows us to kick in a high voltage

47
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,070
cleanly with low impedance and a known

48
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,899
voltage and that typically is a high

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,479
side switch so let me show you oh by the

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
way well if you want to turn on

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,950
something like this I don't see a lot of

52
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,719
battery Manuel battery management but I

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,640
don't see a you know how to turn these

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,229
on and off real easy this being on our

55
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,500
Asbury Park um well we can turn it on

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,020
easily from a high site switch turning

57
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,940
it off in a way that doesn't crash the

58
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,190
memories a little more

59
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,130
maduk you know we'll discuss that so let

60
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,510
me show you some of the options that I

61
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,880
looked at to make a high side switch and

62
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,300
then why I pick the option I did here's

63
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,370
a couple different technologies that I

64
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,460
kind of glanced at mentally as I think

65
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,930
of things like you know how do I make a

66
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,970
good clean switch and in the old days

67
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,890
you know we did use a lot of mercury

68
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,800
wetted reed relays problem is they do

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
have some issues and there's an inductor

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
involved and there's some current

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,620
flowing bolt bipolar transistors we

72
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,300
learn bipolar means that there's always

73
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,190
a voltage drop because there's always a

74
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,400
PN Junction hence the by part and so if

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,220
I were to try and use either an NPN or a

76
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,050
PNP transistor I'm going to lose at a

77
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,910
minimum point three volts drop using

78
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,610
standard parts which means if I start

79
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,980
with five on down to of four point seven

80
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,770
which is below my VCC for logic right

81
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,860
and then we've been talking a lot about

82
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,860
Fe T's field effect transistors now I

83
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,420
happen to know that one of the

84
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,610
properties I can select for on an Fe T

85
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,670
is low on resistance they'll actually

86
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,650
tell you RDS it used it's

87
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,630
transconductance actually but we take

88
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,030
the reciprocal of that and they just go

89
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,530
ahead and print as a resistor for you

90
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,940
them does make thinking about it a lot

91
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,100
easier so we're going to look at using

92
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,110
either an n-channel FET or a p-channel

93
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,440
FET fvt MOSFET in will show the

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
different modes here of our three basic

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,360
MOSFETs there's the junction fet kind

96
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,770
the older one where there's actually a

97
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,830
base just touches right if you remember

98
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,870
it's not insulated it's not an egg FET

99
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,090
and slate to get the insulated gate

100
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,660
metal oxide semiconductor uh so let's

101
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,670
throw that out depletion mode well

102
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,410
that's always on unless I turn it off

103
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,600
well that's kind of not what I want I

104
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,980
want something I actually turn on I

105
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,570
don't want this thing defaulting to

106
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,030
turning turning on I want to halt

107
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,000
default to turning off so enhancement

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,370
mode of the enhancement mode we have in

109
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,709
channel and P channel now if you

110
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,600
remember I said that you can remember

111
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,110
which way turns these on by the virtue

112
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,418
that if this arrow is not pointing in it

113
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,100
won't pop the bubble so I can write a

114
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,870
bubble here meaning that this is low to

115
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,350
turn on low from gate to source this is

116
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,270
the gate this is the source

117
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,180
n channel is a high to turn on that

118
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,889
means this voltage has to be higher than

119
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:33,440
this well that's a problem if I want to

120
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,690
switch 5 volts I'm going to need a

121
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,789
voltage higher than 5 volts to switch it

122
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,470
now there's ways that we can do that I

123
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,330
may show you one before we get out of

124
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,229
here

125
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:44,389
but already I'm starting to go well a

126
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,909
p-channel sounds pretty simple if I just

127
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,550
have to like make its gate lower than

128
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,159
the input voltage to turn it on all

129
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,849
right here's a high side switch using a

130
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:58,460
in this case a P channel MOSFET I told

131
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,770
you it was going to be simple if we

132
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,500
remember the logic of a p-channel

133
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,930
if the voltage on the gate is lower than

134
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,729
the source and that value is called the

135
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,530
voltage gate source threshold if it's

136
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,210
lower by more than a certain amount I'm

137
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,349
going to show you the spec sheet in a

138
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:14,900
second if this will turn on actually in

139
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,610
in between it will be turn on in between

140
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,009
but we're interested in turning this on

141
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,840
all the way to get the properties we

142
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,379
want so for a p-channel it's low we'll

143
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,539
turn this on and if we release it this

144
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,250
resistor will pull it back high so that

145
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,349
VN is equals off so when the voltage

146
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:31,969
input is the same on the gate and the

147
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:34,219
source it's definitely off when we

148
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:36,289
exceed the voltage gate source threshold

149
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,199
it turns on now had this been an in

150
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,210
channel again this voltage would have

151
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,440
had to be up here somewhere it would

152
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,449
have had to go higher than this would

153
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,719
have been the source and if the voltage

154
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,909
gate source threshold is a volt that we

155
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,620
would have needed to volt above v n'j to

156
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,419
turn this on and they actually do that

157
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,949
they'll make a little charge pump to do

158
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,110
that because honestly using n channel

159
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,520
devices a little better they're a little

160
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,889
cheaper they're easier to make and the

161
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,779
reason simply is their geometries are

162
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,180
simpler on the inside because they use

163
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,759
electrons for carriers this is using

164
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,770
hole flow if you think of little pluses

165
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,659
coming out of a battery which is kind of

166
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,669
common way to think about this those

167
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,219
really are holes and their mobility is

168
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:19,099
less than our one electron with so with

169
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,990
that said I'd think hard before I put

170
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,759
just grab a p-channel because the in

171
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,900
channel really is the bread and butter

172
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,240
but for a nice simple little circuit

173
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,340
like this I'm grabbing a p-channel a

174
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,800
resistor and I'm all but done so let me

175
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,229
show you this actually working and then

176
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,870
we'll show why this is almost magic and

177
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,960
I say that because the resistance inside

178
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,020
this thing is so

179
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,449
small that if I put five volts in I'm

180
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,660
going to get almost five volts out

181
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,699
here's a selection of p-channel FETs I

182
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,539
used digitize parametric search to just

183
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,310
come up with a selection tight so I can

184
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,750
show the different properties that was

185
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,419
nice and simple we did I did end up

186
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,129
using the one here on the top no big

187
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,949
surprise I put it on the top and when we

188
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,509
look at it we find that when we go to

189
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,069
use it it's going to have point zero

190
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,830
eight ohms when it's turned on and that

191
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,330
it only takes a volt to turn it on

192
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,740
that's great because that means I could

193
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,590
still turn on a 2.5 volt source because

194
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,530
I've got greater than a bowl look I get

195
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,960
20 amps out of it the downside is I got

196
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,840
to spend a buck and a half and a to-220

197
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,110
case if I go to tio 92 cases the

198
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,030
resistance jumps up so there's to some

199
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,639
time when that will be helpful and

200
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,099
that's because the geometry inside the

201
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,039
to-220 big wide flat die allows you to

202
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,780
lower the resistance lots of stuff in

203
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,870
parallel so here's just kind of the

204
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,490
trade-offs you can see our resistances

205
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,710
our amperages and even the cost this

206
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,169
one's a real low RDS but you pay for it

207
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,009
so we're picking the 60 20 and it's got

208
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,750
point oh eight ohms when it's turned on

209
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,250
and let's see what that looks like in

210
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,960
real life here's our simple little

211
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
circuit comprising of just the p-channel

212
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,210
Fe T the bias resistors right there

213
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,219
right here is our input voltage about 5

214
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:05,250
volts here's our output voltage this is

215
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,729
a 5 ohm power resistor so we've got a 5

216
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,460
ohm load on 5 volts which should give us

217
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,310
an amp if you remember that power equals

218
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,949
I squared R 1 amp squared is still 1

219
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,949
times R is 5 so that means this is

220
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,349
dissipating 5 watts

221
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:24,779
since this resistance is way less than 5

222
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,449
ohms it's not hardly dissipating

223
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,860
anything but this thing's getting a

224
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,529
little warm so all we have to do to turn

225
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,450
this on is I've got my gait terminals

226
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,979
here I'm going to short them together

227
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,679
when the blue LED turns tells us it's on

228
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,958
and if we look at the output voltage

229
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,380
I've got 4.96 with a 10 ohm resistor

230
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,160
load and the input or the voltage drop

231
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,170
across this part there's my missing

232
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,880
voltage if I add all that up it's very

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,670
close to 5 so I am losing

234
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:59,459
in this case the RDS on must be 0.057

235
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,089
homes so a little less than the point oh

236
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,740
eight in the spec which was an absolute

237
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,800
max but how about that I can I got my

238
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,860
nice five volts output from one simple

239
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,899
little part and just grounding the gate

240
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,269
since the FE T itself is high impedance

241
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,670
uh the gate on that I can actually

242
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,070
control with an IO line so that means I

243
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,290
can switch on and off this 10 ohm load

244
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm sorry 5 ohm load that equals 1 amp 5

245
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
watts of power and I can do it with an

246
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,529
i/o port one last little idea that we

247
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,420
can do with this circuit is to make it

248
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,350
latching like a push button on so here

249
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,089
I've added a transistor an NPN in this

250
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,480
case a 2 + 3 904 and I'm biasing it from

251
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,630
the output so that once this is on this

252
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,910
read this current flow through the

253
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,649
resistor voltage through the resistor

254
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,260
equals current will bias this on and

255
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,779
pull this to ground so we ground this to

256
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,730
turn it on and then once the voltage

257
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,839
arrives it will hold it on so a push on

258
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,940
we could also short from here to here if

259
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,070
you wanted to if this in a big load and

260
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,350
just get again the voltage over there in

261
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,209
the same way and and and it will turn

262
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:15,000
this on to turn it off then we need to

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,100
steal that current away from this NPN

264
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,199
transistor by grounding this and by

265
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:20,519
ground I mean you got to get it under

266
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,620
the 0.6 volts point 5 or whatever it

267
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,470
takes to turn this on to ground it out

268
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,500
so we've got push here on push here off

269
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,410
now let me say though this doesn't mean

270
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,149
this is a production-ready circuit if I

271
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,500
were doing this for real I put a

272
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,149
protection diode here in case there was

273
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,130
some capacitance out here and this

274
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,750
voltage for a second was higher than

275
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,910
this it'd flow around the FE T instead

276
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,269
of damaging and I might use an Fe T here

277
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,130
instead of a transistor and then I have

278
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,410
more ways I can I have less current flow

279
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,720
and I couldn't have a higher threshold

280
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,180
voltage instead of trying to ground out

281
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,640
the base emitter Junction this is to

282
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,100
show an example so with that said let me

283
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,899
show you this working in real life

284
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,880
here's the circuit where I've added the

285
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,140
2 n 3 904 right here and the resistor up

286
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,529
to the

287
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,319
put the BIOS on resistor and so by

288
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:15,449
shorting out the gate it turns on you

289
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:19,220
can see the LED here we can turn it off

290
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,620
on/off and then something interesting

291
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,870
using my good ol finger I can actually

292
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,769
turn it on to you seems astray so uh but

293
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:31,139
let me show you this actually powering a

294
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,959
circuit so I've chosen a Raspberry Pi to

295
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,839
demonstrate a push to turn on and and

296
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,269
I'm going to say the hard part is

297
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,189
actually knowing when to safely turn it

298
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:42,839
off I'll leave that to you guys you

299
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,399
could put a timer on the output that you

300
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,100
toggle a toggle a one-minute timer at

301
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,680
time out on a 555 and then start your

302
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,309
shutdown sequence or whatnot or some

303
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,620
devices don't can have power remove just

304
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,149
jerked out from under depending on what

305
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,920
it could be so let's give this a shot

306
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,999
alright and let's go to you can see it

307
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,629
booting right there

308
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,079
as a designer I have a bag of tools so

309
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,350
maybe I have like 127 go-to circuits or

310
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,620
thoughts or concepts and then I engineer

311
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,839
what I need for the next project and

312
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,910
sometimes I add that to my bag of tools

313
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,939
sometimes I throw it out so hopefully

314
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,980
this is something that at least as a

315
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,899
placeholder if you want to add this to

316
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,879
your bag of tools that's a high side

317
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,250
switch this is also a cool property of

318
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,100
Fe T's low on resistance you can do lots

319
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,550
of things with driving power motors all

320
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,589
kinds of things but this was just a

321
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:45,689
quick example so bill heard from

322
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,699
hackaday hope to see on the next one and

323
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:51,229
we'll figure out what to talk about then
