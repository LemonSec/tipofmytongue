1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:04,710
they'll heard from hackaday today I'm

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,410
going to show you how I hacked my 1983

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:17,520
Datsun Z engine control unit case you

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,109
couldn't hear me out the garage there

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,820
I'm still bill Hurd and this is still

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,189
hackaday and today I'm swapping out my

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,350
old stock engine control unit from my

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,869
1983 Datsun 280zx T with a mega squirt

9
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,729
that I built myself this is a kit it's

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,640
made by Bolling's and grip oh and uh

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,640
it's it's not open-source hardware but

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,469
it's cheap hardware and then the

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,820
firmware is available you can make

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,890
changes there's all kinds of trains to

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,750
it I'm running what's called mega squirt

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,539
two extra allows me to do lots of cool

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,329
things in addition to the normal ECU

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,750
functions now what's an ECU the ECU

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,670
generally controls the fuel to air

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,039
mixture in your car you might control

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,050
the spark they you know where the spark

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,239
occurs in the combustion cycle of the

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,979
engine and it can control a lot of

24
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,510
things for example I've got mine

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,420
controlling the the fuel pump speed

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,670
things like that so lots of things we

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,340
can do but why would you want to do all

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,909
of this

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,170
well that unit I just showed you is

30
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,450
hardwired it's set up for a certain

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,189
amount of fuel that it expects for a

32
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,409
certain amount of air to make the engine

33
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,290
run at optimal well if you change that

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,500
balance you'll need to change the

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,880
balance of the fuel and air you know

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,250
that that goes along with it so my case

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,200
I shoved a lot more air in the engine

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,259
bigger turbocharger also I've made the

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,150
cylinders bigger and the stroke longer

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,009
and so there's a lot of things going on

41
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,369
and I needed to give it simply more fuel

42
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,430
alright and that required like bigger

43
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,560
injectors in a bigger fuel pump but also

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,659
then controlling the pulse width of that

45
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,070
I'm going to show you that in some

46
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,700
detail so in and why this old cranky car

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,549
in 1983 well some of you may know I

48
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,619
worked for Commodore back in the 80s and

49
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,990
part of getting to CES shows which were

50
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,389
always January of you know of the new

51
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,870
year inevitably a Datsun Z would park in

52
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,920
the parking lot around

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,319
November and then just not move until

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,020
the snow melted and it won't appeared

55
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,810
magically from the snowdrift and then I

56
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,580
would have it towed and then I would use

57
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,430
the bonus I got for making the CSU and

58
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,319
go buy another one it's kind of funny

59
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,700
when they tow the car away to be a

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,920
little sad pile of rust and nuts and

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
bolts but it's it's kind it's a car

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,330
that's kind of near and dear to me so I

63
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,140
spent some time customizing this car so

64
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,480
before I talk more about the ECU I'm

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,180
going to show you about how the basics

66
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,069
of how engines function and I'll show

67
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,780
you all the things this is controlling

68
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,760
here's a block diagram of a kind of

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,819
typical engine let's call it that where

70
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,610
the red arrows represent the trip of the

71
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,220
air through the engine alright so

72
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,140
starting from the air inlet in in my

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,830
case we go through an air flow meter and

74
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,840
the reason is in this case is it's all

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,489
about mixing the right amount of fuel

76
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,739
with the right amount of air now in my

77
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,799
1983 Datsun Z there is this thing called

78
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,560
a flapper that had a door that opened it

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,840
closed and it would give you a value for

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,700
how much air is going through it's kind

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,280
of arcane actually then it went to the

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,989
throttle body and this is where the

83
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,019
accelerator hooks up hooks to through a

84
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,959
mechanical linkage and this is what you

85
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,370
know you're used to stepping on how you

86
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,220
interact with the engine and you might

87
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,870
think that you're adding fuel to the

88
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,700
engine well not directly what you're

89
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,959
really doing is opening a stop gate that

90
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,420
lets more air into the engine so what

91
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,220
you're really doing is adding air every

92
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,840
time you step on the accelerator and

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,570
it's the ECU that figures out how much

94
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,940
fuel then to mix with that air but it

95
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,040
starts with you letting the air in in

96
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,350
most cases in the carburetor days the

97
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,780
same thing except that it was the air

98
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,549
whistling through the venturi that added

99
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,260
more fuel than but it's but it was the

100
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,560
air you opened up the air gets into the

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,810
manifold which is simply a name for the

102
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,450
area above the where the Pistons are in

103
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,340
the valves and everything and this is

104
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,680
where the fuel injectors spray into in

105
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,978
this case and it mixes before it gets

106
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,560
sucked into the Pistons and then it

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
leaves it in the form of exhaust so the

108
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,810
ECU controls the fuel injection

109
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,110
how often or not how often but when to

110
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,389
fire and how much fuel to mix in and

111
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,400
then there's things like the cylinder

112
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,220
head temperature in my case in my Z if

113
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,760
the temperature sensor is broken or the

114
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,090
wires unplugged my car won't run okay so

115
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,389
it's so this is part of how dense is the

116
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,490
air so how much fuels so that's part of

117
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,070
it and then there's an oxygen sensor and

118
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,110
exhaust in my case I've actually added a

119
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,360
second one so that I've got one for the

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
loop of the ECU working and then another

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,500
one for just sensing on my dashboard

122
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,020
things like that and then there's some

123
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,460
other little things going on like

124
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,830
knowing where you are in the cycle the

125
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,280
crank crank case position and ultimately

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,080
control the spark plugs now I'm not

127
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,510
controlling the spark in mind just yet

128
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,180
so now I skipped one and that was the

129
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,520
manifold pressure there is a second way

130
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,360
to tell how much air is going on you

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,340
know how much fuel you need to mix and

132
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,650
that is the manifold pressure the harder

133
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,150
you step on the gas the more of a

134
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,729
suction is created in this manifold by

135
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,440
these pistons running up and down you

136
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,210
can sometimes hear it whistling you know

137
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,550
on some engines and if you get a hole in

138
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,979
your manifold the air car won't run well

139
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,260
or one of the hoses comes off and it's

140
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,940
because it's trying to pull a vacuum

141
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,250
here try to suck this air in and it's

142
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,080
it's it's not it's not being measured

143
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,870
correctly or something now there's a

144
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,789
second way as I said instead of using

145
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,919
the air flow meter you can monitor this

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,139
manifold pressure and that's what the

147
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,010
mega squirt does is is I've left my air

148
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,539
flow meter and in case I want to go back

149
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,789
to it but in this case it measures how

150
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,490
much vacuum in when you're pulling hard

151
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,430
the more vacuum you get and then when

152
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,200
the blower kicks in when the turbo how

153
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,810
much overpressure there is so these are

154
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,419
the basic connections of an ECU to a

155
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,729
fuel-injected engine here's the air flow

156
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:25,320
meter I wanted to show you just how I'm

157
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,150
gain Lee does this thing was that

158
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,880
there's the valve and here's where the

159
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,639
the measuring flapper and here's

160
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,500
actually different shapes of elastomer

161
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,840
cut to make a variable resistor that's

162
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,789
spring tuned and everything and this

163
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,530
thing in normal operation is doing

164
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,450
something like this

165
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,860
to try and measure the earth where's a

166
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,810
more modern airflow sensor this is a

167
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,390
heated wire airflow sensor and you can

168
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,800
actually see through this one this is

169
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,490
from a bmw m3 and basically it measures

170
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,770
how much heat is removed from a heated

171
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,320
wire by the airflow through it so a lot

172
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,110
better than the flapper but again you

173
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,160
know it's something to be said for

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,060
monitoring the manifold pressure or the

175
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,010
actual air flow through into the engine

176
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,680
so and BMW thought this was good enough

177
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,070
to use on one of their sports cars okay

178
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,450
let me show you some of the cool stuff

179
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,450
what you're seeing here is a virtual

180
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,270
dash panel and you can program these

181
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,770
change the look and feel and everything

182
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,470
but I'm just showing some basic controls

183
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,850
and what we're doing is we have a

184
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,830
simulator plugged into our mega square

185
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,900
this simulates the car I can change the

186
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,820
throttle position the throttle position

187
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,910
sensor the temperatures a few variable

188
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,290
things like this and you can't see the

189
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,630
LEDs but they're telling me I'm at idle

190
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,580
and that the fuel pumps on and that it's

191
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,090
firing the the fuel injectors and if you

192
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,740
want to have a cooler dashboard there

193
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,390
are a bunch of others that you can

194
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:54,960
select from I'll just so now as I modify

195
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,210
my rpm I could actually build this into

196
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,490
the dashboard if I wanted to we also

197
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,090
have the option of doing a data logger

198
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,620
where we can make very different things

199
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,170
and it will get logged by this and then

200
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,040
we've got a natural analyzer that will

201
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
help us with the tune-up based on our

202
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,630
driving conditions and we're going to do

203
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,880
that one last but let's get back to

204
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,160
basic setup and this is kind of what

205
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,230
it's all about this is where I

206
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,330
unfortunately I can't make it go

207
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,750
vertically because I don't have a you

208
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,789
know I can't modify the manifold

209
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,250
temperature but this is the RPM and I

210
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,679
can modify these variables around here

211
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,280
to adjust the fuel air mixture and you

212
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,720
should hear it I can actually while it's

213
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,220
sitting there idling and you'll hear go

214
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,040
doo-doo-doo-doo jin-yi and that's really

215
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,140
cool too suddenly it dawns on you that

216
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,820
you're controlling the actual fuel air

217
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,320
mixture in your car so and we can

218
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,970
oh this you know it's a 3d view and

219
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,560
there's a lot of other maps similar to

220
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,590
this and I will show you one on the car

221
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,150
that's running where it actually does an

222
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,640
oval as we step on the gas and release

223
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,890
as the manifold pressure you know it has

224
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,110
load going up and then coasts coming

225
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,090
down I won't go through everything here

226
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,870
but there are engine constants and

227
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,250
injector characteristics I tell things

228
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,230
about how big my injectors are I went to

229
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,300
35 pound injectors they're called

230
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,660
we can control how the engine gets

231
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,630
primed it squirts extra gas in there get

232
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,270
extra fuel in there too to get your

233
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,830
engine running when you first start it

234
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,980
and then also it will enrich the fuel

235
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,440
based on temperature and this is real

236
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,510
important at least in the case of my

237
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,940
vehicle one of the tuning functions in

238
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,520
here is we have acceleration enrichment

239
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,710
which basically says when you slam on

240
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,420
the accelerator it tries to give it an

241
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,790
extra shot of fuel and actually it's

242
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,140
about the only thing monitoring the

243
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,760
accelerator does is in this kind of

244
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,470
setup so there's a wizard in here where

245
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,260
I can say Oh monitor it this way but if

246
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,390
we watch down here in the lower left I'm

247
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,610
going to change the accelerator quickly

248
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,520
and we get this indication right here

249
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,590
that it just gave us an extra shot so

250
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,600
that's one of the features built into

251
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,740
this here's a 3d ve map of the engine

252
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,870
actually running and we see now the

253
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,210
range of motion of the manifold pressure

254
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,340
and the RPMs with the fuel enrichment

255
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,160
shown as a spectral map with the red

256
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,840
being the most fuel and

257
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,480
being the least all right I'm running

258
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,220
out of time but there's just so much to

259
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,260
show you that that's possible with these

260
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,620
things with the the mega squirt you know

261
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,360
they have things for running your

262
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,270
detonation sensor there's launch control

263
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,610
you can run nitrous system you can

264
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,060
control your your turbo boost to connect

265
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,120
as a controller just a lot of things but

266
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,830
one cool thing I wanted to show you is

267
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,029
you can create your own outputs by you

268
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,220
pick which output you want and then

269
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,410
there's just a wide range of values you

270
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,140
can say well hey if the fuel load is

271
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,320
this or if the battery voltage is below

272
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,320
a certain amount and something else is

273
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,330
happening the pin goes higher the pin

274
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,980
goes low and I do something similar to

275
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,080
that to control the speed of my fuel

276
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,050
pump so nice of boolean program ability

277
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,660
also built into this and and finally I

278
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,900
showed this just briefly before in this

279
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,300
version I some versions can actually do

280
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,850
all the logging inside the mega store at

281
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,950
the Version three mine's an older

282
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,290
version of the mega squirt too so I

283
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,390
actually have to my let have my laptop

284
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,670
plugged in and running while I go out

285
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,160
for test drives and it will take the

286
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,550
values that it sees programmed in and

287
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,560
compare them to what it thinks the

288
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,600
optimal value should be based on the

289
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,420
actual running of the engine and then

290
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,250
make suggestions and you can go ahead

291
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,320
and apply that it's a learning easy you

292
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,910
in other words and they have these now

293
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,430
you can you know for the newer cars that

294
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,810
have obd ii and stuff they plug right in

295
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,790
and they're self learning well here you

296
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,230
got to get a little more involved but at

297
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,970
least it can learn and there's reasons

298
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,760
for that for example I wouldn't know

299
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,470
like when you're going at a high rate of

300
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,650
speed and you let off the accelerator I

301
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,420
wouldn't know how much to lean it off to

302
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,910
clean off the spark plugs or to wet the

303
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,700
the walls of the of the Pistons of the

304
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,850
cylinders but this should no tricks like

305
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,060
that so that you end up getting a pretty

306
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,370
reasonable tune just by taking it out

307
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,200
and driving it come back and then you

308
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,720
you look it over and then you save it to

309
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,380
the ECU

310
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,710
so a very cool feature and

311
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,380
finally here's the inside again this was

312
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,200
a kid I built so it was the last of the

313
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,240
through-hole versions if I remember

314
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,700
correctly this is based on a 16-bit

315
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,240
processor called the m9 MC 9 s 12 C 64

316
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,020
which is a 16-bit computer

317
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,370
microcontroller microprocessor

318
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,310
upgrade from the old 60 hhc 12 by

319
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,250
freescale back in the 90s and it's it's

320
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,670
got like a 24 may clock and 4k and 128 K

321
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,820
of RAM and flash beds got things like

322
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,589
building km bus and whatnot but the main

323
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,230
thing is this this is from 2005 so this

324
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,750
was around before so many of the arm

325
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,220
variants and everything we have now you

326
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,589
can find lots of things with can these

327
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:27,680
days but yeah this has some time on the

328
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,810
jumpers are actually there was an area

329
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,580
to build circuitry one the few times

330
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,589
ever used the area to build circuitry as

331
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,600
I brought in some other signals from

332
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,459
from the big ass connector here on the

333
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,589
side and I've made low-pass filters and

334
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:42,770
this some of this goes into my fuel fuel

335
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,800
pump logic stuff like that also I'm

336
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,040
playing with a anti detonation so I

337
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,170
don't rely on the old ECU and of course

338
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,200
drivers big honking rectifiers and

339
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,750
drivers for the fuel injectors you know

340
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,120
which is in relays which is what this

341
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,700
thing ends up driving so not much to it

342
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,220
like I said it was an inexpensive kit

343
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,650
that I put together myself and rivals

344
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,779
the the features of the thousand dollar

345
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,650
kits that are $1000 devices that are out

346
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,470
there today and then there was the lo

347
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,990
mega sim this was also get like 50 bucks

348
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,790
or something this just it's basically a

349
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,360
VCO and some potentiometers but I I

350
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,220
ended up I built one and then I bought

351
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,260
one because it was really nice to do

352
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,140
while working on this thing so not much

353
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,650
to it alright well I hope you found that

354
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,540
interesting I had a blast restore in

355
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,040
this car like I said it was kind of a

356
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,990
legacy thing for me back from the 80s

357
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,079
90s when when I used to drive these

358
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,839
things and uh gosh I've got a mile of

359
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,130
weld and wire in the car I've

360
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,410
powder-coated I've redone the engine

361
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,360
down you know well I opened the engine I

362
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,170
didn't even know what my

363
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,050
that crap was and now I do so and now I

364
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,660
get to put this together put it back in

365
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,550
the car and get the car running again so

366
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,649
bill heard from hackaday I don't even

367
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,029
know what we're doing next time but

368
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,620
stick around and we'll figure it out

369
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,829
together
