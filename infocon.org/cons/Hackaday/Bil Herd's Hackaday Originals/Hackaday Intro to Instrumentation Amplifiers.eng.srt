1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,759
they'll heard from hackaday today I'm

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,420
going to be talking about

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,059
instrumentation amplifiers even the name

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,889
kind of sounds like what they do in

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,080
other words these are not average

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,480
amplifiers or not operational amplifiers

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,789
they're instrumentation what's that mean

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,380
well that means they've got some

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,910
qualities that we like when we're doing

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,310
some more precise measurement or just

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,930
measurement that actually takes a lot of

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,349
gain I'll tell you that these days I've

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,480
got a kid of sensors like for Arduinos

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,070
and stuff just tons of them in there

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,399
almost all of those are conditioned to

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,649
be read right into just a regular OE

17
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,899
analog to digital converter with almost

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,520
no other filtering no words through

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,290
output might be like a volt or something

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,840
but back in the before time we had to do

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,430
our own amplification by the way these

22
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,870
work usually because they'll have a

23
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,120
hybrid chip that sits there with the

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,920
thermocouple with the barometric

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,230
pressure sensor and gives you some of

26
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,449
that gain and adds the linearity adjust

27
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,789
for temperature but you can do the

28
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,649
amplification yourself it's

29
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,390
straightforward if we're using the right

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,880
chips let me show you an instrumentation

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,400
amplifier now it's schematic and we'll

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,700
see what we're talking about here

33
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,320
here's a quick schematic I grabbed that

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,720
just shows an up and a an

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,110
instrumentation amplifier standalone and

36
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,479
it feeds into an analog to digital

37
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,909
converter and this is a whetstone bridge

38
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,280
usually this is the form of a load cell

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
and we're going to talk about those in a

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,790
bit basically this has to be so

41
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,030
sensitive that these these sensors move

42
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,590
in micro volts and so it's

43
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,659
differentially we look for the signal go

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,159
to a little high and this thing will go

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,170
a little low and we take the difference

46
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,439
of that have heads differential and it's

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,939
ready to go into an analog to digital

48
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,829
converter and we do some are things like

49
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,780
we we bump it up so it's not hitting

50
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,369
ground where the converter may have a

51
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,549
problem and it's pretty characteristic

52
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,409
in a operational ear I mean in an

53
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,600
instrumentation amplifier that a gain

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,670
setting resistor is not part of the

55
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,439
chain like you're used to seeing with op

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,630
amps so let me talk about the qualities

57
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,759
to make an instrumentation amplifier an

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,469
instrumentation amplifier or at least

59
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,030
desired to be an instrumentation

60
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,220
amplifier as I just showed its

61
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,160
differential it's got a inverting a non

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
hurting input and we get a lot of gain

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,630
from that we get noise cancellation

64
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,890
we're going to talk about common mode

65
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,630
rejection here in a second where the

66
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,250
signal on both of them gets cancelled

67
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,880
out it's got high impedance it doesn't

68
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,680
load the circuit down if this thing is

69
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,930
real tiny sensitive and you hang

70
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,580
something on there and you feel it all

71
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,870
what you're doing is you're measuring

72
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,630
yourself not not the circuit itself not

73
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,970
the sensor itself so it's high impedance

74
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,160
and not only is a high impedance on the

75
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,050
inputs the inputs are very close to

76
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,120
being identical we don't want one going

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,830
on I've got this in the air one kind of

78
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,380
dragon differently you won't get a clean

79
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,850
reading that way so they're both high

80
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,220
impedance they're both fairly identical

81
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,310
and they both have low current inputs on

82
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,940
most instrumentation amplifiers that way

83
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,970
I mean micro amps peak lamps the reason

84
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,280
for that is that you have less noise

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
less current density noise you have less

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,810
drift in temperature due to those

87
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,840
currents you have less nonlinearities

88
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,910
because ones big ones small because one

89
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,770
was higher one was lower so it just

90
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,680
makes for a better amplifier at the end

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,570
of the day what we're after is a high

92
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,180
gain amplifier with low drift now

93
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,560
there's another kind of these I'm not

94
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,030
going to talk about them today here much

95
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,100
but they're called choppers and zero

96
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,760
drift amplifiers the the rep from layer

97
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,800
technology don't call it chopper sorry

98
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,300
this is zero drift but and I'll show you

99
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,310
we win when that comes we built one of

100
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,459
those 20 25 years ago here's how we

101
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,290
build an operational amplifier back in

102
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,120
the day nowadays you can do it in one

103
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,250
chip first let me show you the

104
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,470
difference between an operational

105
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,200
amplifier that you may make yourself

106
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,790
differential amplifier and an

107
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,770
instrumentation amplifier and then let

108
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,300
me show you how you can use operational

109
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,770
amplifiers to build a differential

110
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,080
excuse me to build an instrumentation

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,850
amplifier because again we used to build

112
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,489
them in the old days and and what we do

113
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,440
is we take two or three op amps and we

114
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,060
put them together that tries to create

115
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,770
the qualities we want from a single

116
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,350
instrumentation amplifier here is an op

117
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,298
amp pick your most favorite op amp you

118
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,959
like you can even have a J FET input and

119
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,460
get some of the low noise that kind of

120
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,539
thing going low bias current but using

121
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:28,110
this amp

122
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,770
fire has issues that make it by itself

123
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,509
not quite what we want in an

124
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,360
instrumentation amplifier and let's

125
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,389
start the one thing we like high

126
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,340
impedance we don't want this to load the

127
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,439
circuit down well tell you that in a

128
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,810
differential amplifier like this where

129
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,509
this feedback loop counters any voltage

130
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,180
a voltage that appears here will be

131
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,159
countered by here and the effective

132
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,919
voltage here will be zero volts that

133
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,379
makes that a ground for all practical

134
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:00,719
purposes which means if this is a

135
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:03,599
hundred K ohms that the input impedance

136
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,030
of this is a thousand one hundred K ohms

137
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,879
to ground that's not very high sometimes

138
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,940
these are less so right there we've got

139
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,060
a the inverting input is typically not a

140
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,710
high impedance input that's that's great

141
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,180
sometimes sometimes we want to mix

142
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,069
signals together where they stop at

143
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,360
ground first so they don't get mixed

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,159
together but not in this case it's not

145
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:27,080
what we want on the non-inverting input

146
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,789
we've got a path to ground here so let's

147
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,830
say this is 100 K and this is 10 K well

148
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,620
this resistance is also a 110 K not what

149
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,080
we want and more and just as importantly

150
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,120
these characteristics of this high

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,129
impedance amplifier with no feedback

152
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,840
versus this one with the feedback

153
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,029
they're not going to track each other we

154
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:47,430
do try and set these resistances to be

155
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,139
equal so at least the temperature part

156
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,180
of it doesn't like whack this amplifier

157
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,729
all over the place but a single

158
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,830
differential amplifier is not an

159
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,379
operational amplifier by itself in this

160
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,110
configuration and again when we see our

161
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,089
gain setting resistors right in the

162
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,270
current flow it gets messy here I've

163
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,050
built I didn't build it I got this off

164
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,029
the internet but I could have easily

165
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,680
drawn this schematic for an

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,560
instrumentation amplifier this is this

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,339
is very standard and what we see now is

168
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,349
the input goes straight into the

169
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,740
non-inverting input of an op amp I could

170
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,440
have built this with my favorite op amps

171
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,279
provided I could live with some of their

172
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:29,930
issues

173
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,550
there's no resistor to ground there's no

174
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,500
gain setting the only requirement is out

175
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,089
here there has to be some kind of path

176
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,080
to ground so this gets biased okay

177
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,099
electronics don't like to really float

178
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,060
they still like to have

179
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,730
current flowing even pico amp so that's

180
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,560
the only requirement for this but if we

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,030
look on the other input one of these

182
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,800
will be like the inverting input and one

183
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,240
will be the non-inverting input see yeah

184
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,680
but they're both high impedance they're

185
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,690
both identical if this if this amplifier

186
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,060
is the same as this then and this is low

187
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,860
impedance that your high impedance then

188
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,410
this is high impedance we find our gain

189
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,210
setting resistor in this case and let

190
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,830
they'll do inside a chip is the laser

191
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,270
trim all of these so they're all nice

192
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,840
and even

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,639
this currents equal this current and

194
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,490
they bring out one single resistor for

195
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,380
gain so a lot of times this is the one

196
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,880
you have access to sometimes it's

197
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,750
programmable using I squared C or SPI

198
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,419
sometimes it's just preset but by taking

199
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,610
high impedance time pins and then

200
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,790
differentiate it different from

201
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,560
differentiating them and keeping our

202
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,050
resistors nice and trimmed inside one

203
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,360
single resistor I'm on my way to making

204
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,729
an instrumentation amplifier I can get a

205
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,650
gain of a hundred I can get a gain of a

206
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,450
thousand I've seen these with gains at

207
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,220
ten thousand you got to get a lot more

208
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,810
careful but we're on our way I do want

209
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,830
to show you in our bag of tricks

210
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,990
Department you actually can build an

211
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,210
instrumentation ample using just two op

212
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,820
amps and again look here's our high

213
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,860
impedance input here's our high

214
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,310
impedance input and this gets negated

215
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,830
gets inverted by virtue it's fed to

216
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,229
there I haven't used this personally in

217
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,660
and they're the only issues I would have

218
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,100
with this first you've got to get all

219
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,750
this so it matches the gain of this

220
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,760
exactly it's not introducing its own

221
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,220
temperature curves its own airs but I

222
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,229
also say there's more delay from here to

223
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,960
here it's going through through an

224
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,850
amplifier well more delay is a pole

225
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,590
there's a low-pass filter going on and

226
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,410
if you were using this where common mode

227
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,110
rejection ratio in higher frequencies

228
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,169
you know the just more to it by virtue

229
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,049
this isn't really identical to this but

230
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,120
low frequencies non-critical

231
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,130
applications and knock yourself out this

232
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,020
is a dual package so you can create an

233
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,500
op amp instrumentation amp in one single

234
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,260
package now some of you that may know my

235
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,940
background a little bit before I

236
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,430
designed

237
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,600
Computers for Commodore which were

238
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,610
mostly digital except everything's

239
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,140
analog I did I worked for Pennsylvania

240
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,810
scale company in Leola Pennsylvania and

241
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,080
we did some pretty rad scales for the

242
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,150
day very they were all processor

243
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,760
controlled they were very precise we

244
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,020
made our own load cells and we're going

245
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,270
to talk about those in a second so we

246
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,280
had to have good analog electronics we

247
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,750
had to have good shielding we had to get

248
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,030
good production techniques because uh

249
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,190
because of the kind of signal we were

250
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,750
trying to amplify and this is a good

251
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,230
example here a load cell which is how a

252
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,710
scale works is how strain gauge how you

253
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,430
measured the strain on a on a bridge or

254
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,240
something mike is a piece is is is a H

255
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,030
shaped piece of metal and we have strain

256
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,350
gauges attached top and bottom and when

257
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,540
you apply a weight to this this will

258
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,300
flex and and those little copper trails

259
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,310
will get slightly longer and slightly

260
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,250
shorter as as we compress and intent as

261
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,250
we compress and elongate them so we're

262
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,740
trying to measure the change in

263
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,010
resistance of a copper trace as it gets

264
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,390
longer and shorter by micro millimeters

265
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,590
okay and we're doing it this is why I'm

266
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,080
showing you here we take 15 volts in

267
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,790
called the excitation voltage and we

268
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,190
might ground this end and that means

269
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,900
that right here in the middle these act

270
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,670
as resistor dividers and these are the

271
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,380
copper traces I was talking about called

272
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,620
strain gauges that this is typically

273
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,090
seven and a half volts and this is

274
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,950
typically seven a half volts and that

275
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,830
little itty-bitty change is writing on

276
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,840
top of that seven and a half volts it's

277
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,450
a whisper and a hurricane alright the

278
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,100
thing that they have in common is it's

279
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,110
the same seven and a half volts here so

280
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,170
it takes this huge signal with a little

281
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,850
bit here and this thing takes a huge

282
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,470
signal with just the opposite a little

283
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,050
bit there and it cancels out the seven

284
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,110
and a half volts so well that what we

285
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,450
get is that whisper in a hurricane times

286
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,840
a thousand times ten thousand times

287
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,760
whatever gain we wanted

288
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,440
so this is called the common mode

289
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,110
rejection ratio CMM are that it's the

290
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,290
ratio of how much the 7.5 volts I can

291
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,430
cancel out while still doing a good job

292
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,520
at the signal right here now a lot of

293
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,400
times uh the if you look like signal

294
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,020
noise ratios and stuff like that you

295
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,080
know 60 80 DB that's pretty good for you

296
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,400
know 8-bit convert or something like

297
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,440
that well if you do the math involved

298
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,570
with canceling out that big of seven and

299
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,400
a half volts to this micro these things

300
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,570
end up having to have CMM RS or CMR RS

301
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,170
you know 120 DB you know so so it's a

302
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,140
different scale that we need this common

303
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,150
mode rejection to work for us to pick

304
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,920
out that little bit but this is a this

305
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,480
is how scale works and I actually have a

306
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,890
strain gauge I'm going to show you here

307
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,050
in the old days we have to head and

308
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,430
build them and cook them and do all

309
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,810
kinds of things these days you buy them

310
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,720
from you game on eBay for $7 and that's

311
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,310
what I did now the part I'm about to

312
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,220
show you today is an analogue devices 82

313
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,560
22 it's a low draft to implement an

314
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,740
instrumentation amplifier before I jump

315
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,940
into that I want to tell you in the old

316
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,220
days when we designed things like this

317
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,080
you're going to find one company in

318
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,880
particular on on here and that's

319
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,940
procession monolithic PMI this is my

320
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,240
data book from 1990 Oh big fat only

321
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,550
about precision I mean these guys knew

322
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,830
it right and we lived through the early

323
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,230
days of popcorn noise on the Opio 1 and

324
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,120
stuff so this is used something called a

325
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,180
no po7 building block and least even use

326
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,100
our own external match transistors to

327
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,240
emulate the front end of an

328
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,090
instrumentation in these guys started to

329
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,520
say are no longer with us

330
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,430
they got bought out by analog devices so

331
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,530
I guess it's not a coincidence that Here

332
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,960
I am sitting on an ad device today so

333
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,600
let me show you the the evaluation board

334
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,450
for that for part two I actually have my

335
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,250
own PCB hopefully shows up in time we're

336
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,290
going to do a zero drift version of it

337
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,360
we're in in theory I should be able to

338
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,590
hit it with the heat gun and have it

339
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,360
still work so let me show you this

340
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,310
evaluation so here's the evaluation

341
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,640
board for the ad 82 22 actually well

342
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,330
there it is and it's pretty

343
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,040
straightforward you can but get one of

344
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,799
these you know without a lot of dollars

345
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,629
if you want to try it without actually

346
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,239
cutting at your own PC at you do see a

347
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,179
surface mount and here is our load cell

348
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:35,909
and you can see that H shape I was

349
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:38,339
talking about the the strain gauges are

350
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,319
here and here and in fact I normally

351
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,669
wouldn't handle one if I was in

352
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:43,679
production and this is real

353
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,929
just the amount of damage I'm probably

354
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,939
doing if I were to bang it it'll

355
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:50,399
remember those stresses but hey this is

356
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,289
just a video and this was just something

357
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,569
I got off eBay so I've got my three

358
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,489
voltages coming in I do tend to twist my

359
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:57,839
wires whenever I'm doing something like

360
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,759
that but with that said we're going to

361
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,559
see some noise later when we because all

362
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,559
these wires hang in the air and let's go

363
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,999
ahead and apply power and see what this

364
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,459
thing looks like finally here we are if

365
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,289
you can hear the background noise none

366
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,999
of my test equipment is quiet

367
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:15,359
it all has fan noise and so we've got

368
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,459
power applied we've got our Keithley

369
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,189
voltmeter attached and I've got my new

370
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:24,599
tech mdo scope attached and here's the

371
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,779
load cell and just by pushing down on it

372
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,809
you can see the deflection on both the

373
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:34,409
scope and the Keithley you will note the

374
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,389
noise and the scope makes it apparent

375
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,009
the Keithley kind of filters a little

376
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,499
bit that's wrong we've got wires hanging

377
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,749
up in the air if we look at the

378
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:48,779
schematic there's room here for RF

379
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,599
filtering that's not in here so this

380
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:56,459
high impedance extreme gain amplifier is

381
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:59,399
amplifying everything around it and and

382
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,069
I can literally do a episode on just

383
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,449
quieting down that because I know I can

384
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:05,579
quiet that down to a nice single again

385
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,189
it's what I used to do but it's still

386
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:11,309
sometimes as amazing that also I'm doing

387
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:13,349
this I'm barely barely barely stretching

388
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:16,229
some copper and and right there I just

389
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,989
overflowed the meter in that range

390
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,269
probably broke those strain gauge tips

391
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,249
so this is an instrumentation amplifier

392
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:26,549
at work and if you can get these kind of

393
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,529
readings now out of something like this

394
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,449
then you can go ahead and pump that into

395
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,440
your AVR your Arduino your

396
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,830
pick whatever you've got going so you

397
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,800
you won't always get the sensor that

398
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,600
happens to be compatible with today's

399
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,240
hobbyist and home processors but the

400
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,850
only downside I'd say to instrumentation

401
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,970
amplifiers is they have moved to be in

402
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,460
surface mount and they were always

403
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,340
layout sensitive and in fact if we do a

404
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,840
thing I know so I'll show you how you do

405
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,400
guard rings and stuff around I mean

406
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,500
these high impedance just think of it as

407
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,640
an amplifier all its own right there are

408
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,290
ways you can buy the board's pre-made

409
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,250
I'll probably here's a differential amp

410
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,420
I'm waiting on an instrumentation ampere

411
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,490
to where it's already mounted and

412
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,860
everything um and then like there are

413
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,470
other boards let me show you this one

414
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,990
this is a TI part of course absorb

415
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,680
national and and I just happen to grab

416
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,330
this in case one didn't work I was going

417
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,160
to use the other and right here you can

418
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,550
see the schematic for the RF filtering

419
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,860
uh that I was talking about on the air

420
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,420
one where the other one wasn't stuffed

421
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,830
for that so and again we and I'm putting

422
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,840
something like into a footprint like

423
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,870
that hopefully this helps helps you

424
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,910
identify what an instrumentation

425
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,030
amplifier is what makes a different than

426
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,920
a regular amplifier and when you might

427
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,770
actually need one and there's just

428
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,960
volumes I mean if if you get books this

429
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,390
thick about the subject then I'm not

430
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,180
lying when I say there's volumes of data

431
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,880
about this topic when it comes to

432
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,560
picking out the signal from amongst the

433
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,050
noise a lot of times you can do it by by

434
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,819
doing a dot in your eyes and picking the

435
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,369
right part so again bill heard from

436
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,380
hackaday hoping this introduction

437
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,359
instrumentation amplifiers wets your

438
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,520
appetite for a little analog maybe we'll

439
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,930
do some more digital here in the future

440
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,970
get off the analog but for now bill

441
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,950
heard from hackaday uh come on back
