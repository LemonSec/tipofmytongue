1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
bill heard from hackaday half a lifetime

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,350
ago I worked at a company called

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,569
commodore who made the most successful

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,250
home computer ever in the commodore 64

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,759
which sold 27 million this is at a time

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,469
when there's 200 million people in

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,020
america and so you can imagine how many

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,570
households had one of these one of the

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,490
reasons Commodore was as good as we were

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,949
what we did was we did our own chips

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,350
including some programmable logic we're

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,560
going to show you some here in a second

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,630
mainly the our competitors Apple were

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,820
using our chips our processor that we

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,590
used designed by Chuck peddle bill

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,860
mentioned his team and her graphics they

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,050
used off-the-shelf chips Atari was

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,390
coming to mos technology who we owned

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,000
for roms and so we were making we are at

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,030
the top the pyramid making the chips so

21
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,789
I was in the right place at the right

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,390
time and I designed the Commodore 128 as

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,670
a follow-up this thing's huge

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,039
it's a beast jeri ellsworth gave me crap

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,280
about this one day but this was possible

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,630
because of programmable logic and our

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,260
own chips so this is a Commodore made

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,630
80-column chip this is a Commodore made

29
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,780
40 column chip there's a processor we

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,060
made there's an MMU that I had made for

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,549
this and then there's a PLA and it's in

32
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,799
a 48 pin package the biggest package we

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,420
made and the biggest package I'd ever

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,650
seen till the till the 68,000 Hershey

35
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,540
bar came out that thing was huge we used

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,180
to land airplanes on it so this

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,420
particular programmable logic was called

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,270
a PLA gate and I'd argue it was probably

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,159
the earliest form of programmable logic

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,689
it had an end it had an it had an

41
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,299
and/or array and what that meant was

42
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,909
let's see if we can get it up here what

43
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,860
that meant was we had every term here we

44
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,079
could pick between a negative or a

45
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,450
positive version of that and put them

46
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,600
down into a NAND gate for this now in

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,540
real life though we had one of these I'm

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,790
not going point we had one of these for

49
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,680
each of the outputs and now you start to

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,139
see the size of this array here to trite

51
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,900
so we that was designed into the

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,470
commoner

53
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,960
sixty-four and it was a spinoff the chip

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,300
called the eight 2's 100 which was made

55
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,260
by signetics we might have copied it at

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,630
mos I say that because we had the room

57
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,370
with the with the Polaroid camera

58
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,830
pictures all around the edge of somebody

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,380
else's PLA and then we made our own a

60
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,810
condor now it actually turned out to be

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,420
the highest failing chip we had even

62
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,910
though well the thick chip was pretty

63
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,950
bad too so one time the PLA s were

64
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,810
failing and they were like they were

65
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,460
rotting they were eating themselves

66
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,190
alive and at the time I think I was from

67
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,540
a group of people that just kind of

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,930
assumed that the metal structure of

69
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,790
doing these arrays that I just showed

70
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,060
you was causing the passivation the the

71
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,980
insulating coating they do to keep air

72
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,260
out and everything else got too thin at

73
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,170
the tops but what it turns out to have

74
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,510
been was the boron that they put into

75
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,970
the silicon nitride to actually give it

76
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,400
more flow to go down into the valleys

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,560
was actually attacking the aluminum and

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,970
you could see it in the microscope you

79
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,470
could stick on these on there and we

80
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,180
called it the purple creeping crud and

81
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,150
you could just see it there and so it

82
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,310
was eating everything live so I pick up

83
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,260
on this chip and I say cool we can use

84
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,870
it for the 128 I need more than twice

85
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,760
the number of terms because I got to do

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,430
the Commodore 64 functions plus these

87
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,920
new ones and we had dual processor - got

88
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,470
you know - two graphics chips and stuff

89
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,230
and so we made it twice as big right

90
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,900
twice as main terms well in an array

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,910
where you have twice the resistance from

92
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,890
being twice as big and twice the

93
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,750
capacitance from being twice as big

94
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,140
that's four times the load the RC load

95
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,110
that gets driven and so we got lucky but

96
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,600
well you know it worked but we were at

97
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,950
the end of where we could go with that

98
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,810
technology so it's the biggest PLI a

99
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,650
that made sense to us and it tied

100
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,269
everything together it's what made this

101
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,790
possible but now this thing's are

102
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,890
freaking compa it's it's a contradiction

103
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,070
right I've got a PLA tying all this

104
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,390
stuff together but then I got these

105
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,010
little gates all over the freaking place

106
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,798
right you - bill why don't you put those

107
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,380
in a PL D we have PL DS of the time

108
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,890
let's see if I can pull one up here this

109
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,360
was a PL D 16

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,810
v16 l 816 v8 22 v10 these were the pl DS

111
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,199
of the time um they're still an and/or

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
array we like to throw a flip-flop on

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,090
the end and feedback so now we have the

114
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,370
ability for state machines and because

115
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,110
they're way smaller you can do something

116
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,210
like a DRAM controller with this and on

117
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,479
the PLA you can make chip select logic

118
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,250
lousy DRAM controller this thing D Ram

119
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,000
controller

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,889
limited 16 18 20 22 pin chip up you know

121
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:02,099
skinny dip and so it was limited where

122
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:04,050
it could go but these things had another

123
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,729
reason I could use them though is that

124
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,860
they were $4.50 if memory serves me and

125
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,150
if I put two of them in this thing

126
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,289
that'd be close to $10.00 we sold just

127
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,150
under six millions had sixty million

128
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,610
dollars I would have spent if I had used

129
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,590
PLD so what we did we gave up board

130
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,300
space and I probably have about a dollar

131
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,750
ten worth of jungle logic here and

132
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,939
actually what I done was looked at what

133
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,889
was in stock in Hongkong and design from

134
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,900
stock we had like half a million 7400

135
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,449
sixes in stock that kind of thing so

136
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,120
this was the the you know the extent we

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,490
could take the PLA the ple didn't yet

138
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,560
have room in a mass production like we

139
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,229
did the Z 8000 guys were starting to use

140
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,870
it and that takes us up to CPLDs

141
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,539
and FPGAs so we're going to talk about

142
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,180
that briefly as we grew out of the PLA

143
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,080
S&P LDS I remember this early 90s we

144
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,639
started working with companies eiling's

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,710
here's a modern-day Xilinx this is an

146
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,449
FPGA

147
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,529
and we're going to play with him later

148
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,580
not in this show but they had all of 64

149
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,039
registers in them they worked on a CGA

150
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,990
monitor which meant you had four colors

151
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,879
choose from yellow green some other

152
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,449
thing CGA colors and you had to go long

153
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,270
and put little dots where you wanted the

154
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,099
wires to connect so you auto you

155
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,199
manually routed the inside of this thing

156
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,969
it was horrible

157
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,759
but we loved it we could route without

158
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,889
routing we could fix problems after the

159
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,330
board was made you know and that's

160
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,800
that's one the hidden beauty is a

161
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,920
programmable logic so and then

162
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,490
we grow into rapidly I think suddenly

163
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,460
the design links and altaira both have

164
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,700
software we can use to program the chips

165
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,000
using at the time I used a HDL altaira

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,130
high-level design language you could

167
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,740
still use schematics and we got into

168
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,040
CPLDs complex programmable logic devices

169
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,820
there there PLDs on steroids in what you

170
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,770
can do is is have an array that's huge

171
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,100
right and because there in chips 144

172
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,550
pins in this case for a CPL d so and now

173
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,030
this is one that see if you can see it

174
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,190
there we're going to actually light this

175
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,990
up and program it here this is one I

176
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,380
designed that is meant to fit on top of

177
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,030
a Arduino mega

178
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,460
and it's got some eight and a second

179
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,490
static Ram as a close by it what we call

180
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,190
tightly coupled and we're going to make

181
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,690
some LEDs blink so I'm going to actually

182
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,130
show you some bare log code and make a

183
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,250
counter and make these LEDs light we're

184
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,480
going to try and do that in about eight

185
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,400
minutes here so because I want you to

186
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,020
see all the way through from beginning

187
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,680
in you can use these parts hardest parts

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,770
soldering the 144 pin to the to the to

189
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,810
the board and that's fun right so I'm

190
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,900
going to bring this video to a close and

191
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,730
you know say that that's that wraps up

192
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,360
our summary of PLA S&P ALS and in the

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,650
very next video I'm going to show you

194
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,800
how to program a CPL D from scratch so

195
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,050
bill heard from hackaday and if you're

196
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,960
hankering a hacker why not go for it
