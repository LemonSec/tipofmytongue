1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,760
until heard from a kadai today we're

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,499
going to be talking about the osso Lily

3
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:05,640
diode part one

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,039
so grab your anode and I'll meet you on

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,430
the court

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,939
all right we're talking about the diode

7
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:20,610
today and as you heard me say the O so

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,189
lowly diode and I'm just picking on the

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,960
diode because it has two leads you'd

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
think it couldn't do a lot with just two

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,160
leads compared all the leads that are

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,310
out there but a diodes can do an awful

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,410
lot they can rectify they can detect

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,390
they can act as a voltage reference a

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,040
temperature reference they can emit

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,469
light it can change their capacitance

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,710
they can emit microwaves and I'm sure

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,420
there's things I've forgotten about so

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,520
we don't have time to do all that but

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,780
we're going to catch a couple things

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,370
today show you some of the basics about

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,470
diodes and I think we'll probably have a

23
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,450
part two and go in more into the LEDs

24
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,020
and stuff so I want to help visualize

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,960
what's going on inside a diode and

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,970
hopefully this helps you to visualize if

27
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,420
if you hadn't seen this before and so we

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,920
start with the diode which has two

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,350
dissimilar types of silicon and in the

30
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,090
silicon diode there's other materials

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,890
but we're talking silicon for a second

32
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,960
so they're doped with two different

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,640
materials like phosphorus and boron and

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,670
they're kind of thing where one has an

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,979
abundance of electrons so the majority

36
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,430
carrier on the end is electrons and the

37
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,830
other one has has a majority of holes or

38
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,080
in other words a missing electron and

39
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,970
it's going to try and it has an affinity

40
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,920
for trying to put an electron into that

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,340
hole and becoming neutral so on the Left

42
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,170
we have lots of electrons represented by

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,979
these marbles and on the P side we've

44
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,040
got jacks you can kind of see they even

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,500
look like a little plus sign right is

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,400
sitting at rest then what happens is the

47
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,650
material in the middle the electron and

48
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,930
the hole come together and they form

49
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,729
actually a kind of insulator because

50
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,439
they're neutral now they are not neither

51
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,689
positive or negative and they're not

52
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,220
going to let current go through them

53
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,258
because the electrons aren't free to

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,720
jump from from atom to atom that kind of

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,709
thing so now if we apply a current let's

56
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,459
say we apply a current backwards so if

57
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,849
we

58
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,840
put electrons on this side and holes on

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,820
this side what happens is they're

60
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,980
actually pulled away from the center

61
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,350
because they attract the negative

62
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,300
electrons are attracted to the holes the

63
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,690
holes over here are electrons they track

64
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,890
each other so this is a diode in that is

65
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,310
not conducting currently if we reverse

66
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,800
it and we start putting electrons on

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,980
this end for example and we keep adding

68
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,280
it what happens is it starts to push

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,410
this barrier down the diode and

70
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,870
eventually at some point it goes into

71
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,410
full conduction and so there's a diode

72
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,150
that's in full conduction it's pushed

73
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,820
all the whole carriers off the end of it

74
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,340
and it's going like that that would be

75
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,820
the electron flow so let's take a look

76
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,460
at a standard silicon diode in this case

77
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,350
a single diode and I'm using the one in

78
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,940
nine one four which is a very common

79
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,220
diode and again it's a signal diode it's

80
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,810
not like one of the big power one so

81
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,239
which actually the VF goes up in those

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,520
things so in this case I've got a

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,650
resistor from in series with the diode

84
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,290
across the power supply and so the

85
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,780
voltage drop across the diode is 0.7

86
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,610
seven as seen by this little voltmeter

87
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,030
right here now we say point six a lot

88
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,530
but the reality is it can wander around

89
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,410
point six up two point eight and and

90
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,840
different members of the family can have

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,090
different attributes as we'll see so I'm

92
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,500
going to show some other diodes here in

93
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,440
a bit on the Left I wanted to show the

94
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,870
proportion of what gets lost in the

95
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,230
diode versus the full signal so if if

96
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,000
the signal was going up and finally went

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,580
in into forward conduction here

98
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,950
all's I'm really showing is we lost this

99
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,829
much of the signal and this much of the

100
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,079
signal you know it's it's one half got

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,180
lost in the silicon diode and you

102
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,980
wouldn't ever measure it this way but

103
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,870
I'm just kind of trying to show it

104
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,770
graphically

105
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,169
here I've replaced the standard silicon

106
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,990
diode of the one in nine one four with a

107
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,090
Schottky diode a one in fifty eight

108
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,550
nineteen and right off the bat you see

109
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,360
that the voltage is much lower here and

110
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,400
we typically think that is 0.3 on the

111
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,669
average and over here where we show the

112
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,919
the percent of a signal that would be

113
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:51,050
affected by the drop of a diode the

114
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,810
forward voltage drop now remember the

115
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,879
last one where it was halfway here it's

116
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,680
taken you know about a third of the

117
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,960
signal and this is just a trick to say

118
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,659
Oh compared to a one amp or I'm sorry a

119
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:05,449
one volt signal this is how much the

120
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,580
diode throws away so again you wouldn't

121
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,039
actually measure it this way now what

122
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,409
what makes a Schottky diode a Schottky

123
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:14,900
diode is that it's actually a silicon on

124
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,069
metal joint and the metal itself then

125
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,710
kind of migrates into the die and I

126
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,289
believe that adds a P P carrier to it

127
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,759
and a Schottky least calm hot carrier

128
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
not gun so well hot carrier shot keys in

129
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,750
the old days in in that relates to the

130
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,300
physics of the carriers moving through

131
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,819
that little tiny junction of the the

132
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,229
wire piece so I'm going to show you one

133
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:44,840
in a second it's such a small Junction

134
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,000
that first off the capacitances are real

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,039
small so that you can get higher speeds

136
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,529
but then I believe it's like a river

137
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:53,419
where your neck it way down till gets

138
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,580
skinny well the same amount of volume

139
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,529
now it's traveling a lot faster and that

140
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,840
it's that speed that kinetic energy that

141
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,000
allows the carriers to get across the

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,069
junction so that's that's what we

143
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,560
referred to as a hot carrier Schottky in

144
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,969
the old days nowadays we just call them

145
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,800
jockeys most of the time here's what I

146
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,360
would argue to be a cousin of the

147
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,770
Schottky diode and that's an old

148
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,719
germanium this is a one in thirty four a

149
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:17,180
I grew up with these things we make

150
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,340
crystal radios out of them when we

151
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,469
weren't busy making them out of pencil

152
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,289
points and and safety razors and I'll

153
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,569
have to show you one of those if we get

154
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:27,020
to it

155
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,330
but it had the same effect we had just a

156
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,729
pinpoint of one material touching the

157
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,740
flat surface of another and that's it

158
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,419
right here you can see this used to be

159
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,969
called a cat's whisker there there's the

160
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,279
metal and a note and the

161
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,939
right here is the small surface area and

162
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,039
and so you could see the capacitance

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,069
isn't real big and also that hot carrier

164
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,599
effect of everything trying to squeeze

165
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,969
through this Junction other carriers go

166
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,079
along for the ride

167
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,059
so again this is a germanium diode they

168
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,669
do have a voltage drop you know 0.3

169
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,579
point 4 but they get up to 0.5 and and

170
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,909
it can be a diode you have to use with

171
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:09,209
care here I've got a split screen and

172
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,159
I've got two different Zener diodes and

173
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,929
I'm going to heat them up equally so we

174
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,509
have a 6.8 on the top and a 4.3 at the

175
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,339
bottom and let's see what happens okay

176
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,899
I've now frozen the screen and you can

177
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,349
see that the 6.8 volt Zener went up with

178
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:27,239
heat now I zeroed this before I applied

179
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,429
the heat but the 6.8 volt went up with

180
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:31,919
heat and the 4.3 volt went down with

181
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,869
heat so if you're wondering why that is

182
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,909
well one of these isn't really a Zener

183
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,979
diode one is actually an Avalanche diode

184
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,229
the 6.8 there's some zine or some

185
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,149
Avalanche and all of them but basically

186
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:46,949
any Zener diode over 5.6 tends to be an

187
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,839
avalanche dial and any underneath it

188
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,969
tends to be a Zener diode now as it

189
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,489
turns out a 5.6 has pretty much kind of

190
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,619
equal of both and it's actually got

191
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:57,360
pretty good temperature compensation it

192
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,669
doesn't go high or low near as much and

193
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,589
so in the old days we used to use that

194
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,419
when we are building our power supplies

195
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,299
and things we'd use a 5.6 and you know

196
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,489
then a diode drop down from there gives

197
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,469
you five so it's a nice easy voltage to

198
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,899
work with but so now the next time you

199
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,299
have at a moment of Zen maybe you're

200
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:17,189
having actually a moment of Evelynn all

201
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:18,719
right we've been talking about diodes

202
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,610
and things like forward voltage drop

203
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,219
sometimes when we're using analog

204
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,319
circuitry we might want the

205
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,329
rectification without the voltage drop

206
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:29,579
and so here's one little technique we

207
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,909
tend to do this is a an op-amp with a

208
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,948
diode in the feedback loop and what will

209
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:38,429
happen here is the output will swing to

210
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,429
whatever it needs to to make the inputs

211
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,068
equal over here and in doing so it'll

212
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:46,259
take out the forward the voltage lost in

213
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,050
the diode and if the diode it still only

214
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,300
conducts in one direction so we get a we

215
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,279
get a half signal here that we see on

216
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,510
the side so

217
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,360
I'll be doing it with one of my little

218
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,240
analog blocks here that I use and we'll

219
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,920
take a look at the circuit I take a look

220
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,840
at the scope here for you and and here's

221
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,760
the board powered up in front of the

222
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,170
scope and you'll see that we've

223
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,940
accomplished what we set out to do which

224
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,370
was keep most the signal intact and yet

225
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,860
still have it act as a rectifier in the

226
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,260
positive direction well that's it for

227
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,450
this video I'm sure we'll get back to

228
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,160
diodes as a topic there's a lot of

229
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,450
things we didn't talk about including

230
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,430
LEDs you know where you're you get to

231
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,690
interact with your senses

232
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,350
so with that said Bill heard on behalf

233
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,840
of hackaday keep on hacking
