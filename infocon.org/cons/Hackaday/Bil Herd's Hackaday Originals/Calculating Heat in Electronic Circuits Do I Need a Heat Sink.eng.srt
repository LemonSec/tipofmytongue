1
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,760
hi I'm bill herd on behalf of hackaday

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,740
today we're going to be talking about

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,349
heat and thermal resistance now this is

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,179
one of the first things I learned as an

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,619
engineer working his way up through

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,109
through the ranks was how to tell how

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,960
hot an object gets and therefore what

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,029
its reliability would be so it's not

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,010
something that I got out of a data book

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,869
you'll hear me say I was a self-taught

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,359
engineer that that's not quite true

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,820
because I learned a lot from the people

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,160
and the engineers I worked with so my

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,559
first week on the job as an engineer and

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,660
a guy named Ken Bart stopped by and said

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,149
if you can add and multiply you could do

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,040
thermal resistance and that's what we're

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,440
going to do here so what are we talking

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,149
here today what are we talking about why

20
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,039
is thermal resistance what's that mean

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,020
anything to us well we're talking about

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,120
power devices power MOSFETs power

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,670
transistors we're talking about heat

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,559
sinks of all sizes and shapes and we're

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,760
talking about the little things in

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,210
between this may even apply to a 3d

27
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,430
printer where you've got the heating

28
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,490
element here in wattage and the as the

29
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,110
heat goes down that that's a thermal

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,150
resistance and maybe with the right

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,070
numbers we can even tell how hot it gets

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,439
where and if that were to keep my

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,600
printer from jamming that'd be great so

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,630
um real quick the unit of measure for

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,909
thermal resistance is theta it's a Greek

36
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,430
letter you'll see it as T sometimes

37
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,590
because we can't print they'd all around

38
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,840
the place and it's measured in degrees C

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,299
per watt so if we move this around a

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,490
little bit we have theta times watts

41
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,320
equals the temperature the temperature

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,490
drop so before we go any further we need

43
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,280
to discuss wattage and we're going to

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,890
just use for examples 2 watts but in

45
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,880
real life

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,280
you see a three terminal regulator here

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,220
if it drops 3 volts across it at one amp

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,680
of current draw by the by the project

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,170
that's three watts all right now that we

50
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,390
know the power in our example here we

51
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,520
can go ahead and do some calculation

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,770
right out of the data sheets so as you

53
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,719
can see I've been scribbling on my table

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,270
here a little bit and this is the same

55
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,090
thing you saw before except now we pick

56
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,800
two watts typically

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,810
we do our calculation from the junction

58
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,930
inside the transistor out to the ambient

59
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,150
air you can actually go backwards and

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,370
say hey of the temperature I'm allowed

61
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,650
to get you come back in okay you've

62
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,810
probably seen this heatsink this is a

63
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,210
common one and and this is kind of like

64
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,400
the the standard size you would see

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,950
before you go with something customized

66
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,780
or something that you have to put a lot

67
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,820
of thought but this is a building block

68
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,990
and that's why I want to do this

69
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,730
exercise and show you how I'm going to

70
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,740
use it so if we look at the data sheet

71
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,540
for this we see that it's got a thermal

72
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,600
resistance up in the top left of 25.8

73
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,790
let's call it 25 because I'm old and I

74
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,130
like round numbers so or my math doesn't

75
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,500
work anymore you do see a chart below

76
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,160
where it's showing you the how well it

77
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,900
works when you force air by it this

78
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,060
starts to get the convection part but

79
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,100
we're going to take just the 25 degrees

80
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,350
for our example here by the way you'll

81
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,420
find this on all heat sinks they want

82
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,830
you to use their parts so they're going

83
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,150
to tell you how and tell you the

84
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,870
information and let's take a look at

85
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,600
putting this all together so if you

86
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,480
start with an ambient of 38 degrees C

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,190
which is a hundred degrees Fahrenheit

88
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,930
just part I picked you could get hotter

89
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,510
but let's let's just take with that if

90
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,080
we take two watts which we said we will

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,260
use as an example in 25 which we just

92
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,440
got out of the datasheet we see that

93
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,260
that's 50 degrees C that we add on to

94
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,930
the temperature so now we're up to 88

95
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,480
degrees C and we're ready to go into the

96
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,940
device this is the case to say and quite

97
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,920
simply that just means marrying this up

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,820
to this if these are both perfectly flat

99
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,250
they'll do okay like this we're actually

100
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,870
going to show the numbers in a second

101
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,080
most often we use the heat sink compound

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,209
we used to call this bird poop in the

103
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,100
old days we didn't call it poop I

104
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,630
actually called it something else and

105
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,790
it's because it just gets all over the

106
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,440
place gets in your hair all over the

107
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,200
person next to you so heat sink compound

108
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,680
and bare steel is one way we can have

109
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,140
heat sink compound in a mica insulator

110
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,070
and this is if we

111
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,560
insulate the heatsink so that we're not

112
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,020
short and stuff together and then the

113
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,480
third one you'll see sometimes is this

114
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,340
little thick so that this of silicon

115
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,700
insulator that that the production

116
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,440
people actually kind of like it's a

117
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,740
little more costly but it won't come off

118
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,240
you don't have to worry about the grease

119
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,750
washing away and it will fill in any

120
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,540
perfections between the device and the

121
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,320
heatsink so here we see that just

122
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,380
thermal grease by itself is 0.1 or 0.2

123
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,650
degrees C per watt we see that mica if

124
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,660
you need an insulator with thermal

125
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,880
grease is 0.3 or 0.4 so if you have 2

126
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,880
watts I'd be 0.6 to 0.8 and then you see

127
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,040
the silicon rubber that I was showing

128
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,590
you that's a degree C per watt so here

129
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,540
we are back at our equation and we just

130
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,690
learned that mica with thermal grease is

131
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,630
point 4 degrees C per watt we have 2

132
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:32,800
watts so that'll be 0.8 degrees so now

133
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120
we're up to eighty eight point eight

134
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,250
degrees okay here we pulled up the

135
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,850
datasheet on an lm317 it's a one of the

136
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,400
older fashion voltage regulators it's

137
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,920
not an L do itself but these still apply

138
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,290
to every regulator out there you'll find

139
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,390
three pieces of information off this

140
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,880
particular part of the datasheet one of

141
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,190
the top right corner is the max rating

142
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,190
of 125 degree C for consumer you'll see

143
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,930
there's a 150 degrees C up there but

144
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,900
most the time it's 125 for us you see

145
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,020
that the case the the junction to case

146
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,140
is 4 degrees C per watt so if that's 2

147
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,270
watts there'll be 8 degrees temperature

148
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,000
of the final last part getting into the

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,960
dye if you want to use the the lm317

150
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,900
without a heatsink it also gives you

151
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,120
that it just says hey from jongshin

152
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,120
ambient it's 50 degrees c per watt times

153
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
2 watts is a hundred degrees right there

154
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,730
so you'll see we probably need a

155
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,560
heatsink in this particular

156
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,930
demonstration and finally we get to the

157
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,730
junction to case

158
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,860
spec so we've added three resistances

159
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,370
together

160
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,710
the junction a case the junction is the

161
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,350
junction of the chip and the metal frame

162
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,270
or lead bond frame or you know all these

163
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,889
different things I'm going to show you

164
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,360
one here we've got a to3 case these used

165
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,340
to be popular back when I first started

166
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,550
and now the two yo to 20 cases replaced

167
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,110
it one time I even dropped one of these

168
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,790
while I was in the service and it

169
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,530
rattled afterwards I think there's big

170
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,389
little chunky germanium or something

171
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,710
so mmm if you look here I've got it on

172
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,479
my screen here it's on your screen now

173
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,900
the die or the junction is this thing

174
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,699
right here these are two bonded lead

175
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,240
wires for two of the terminals but

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
that's the junction and you can even see

177
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,650
now we're talking about getting it from

178
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,020
here to all the metal that's around

179
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,080
there so that we can get it back out to

180
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,810
the heatsink on on its way and if you

181
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,550
look at this drawing here this is

182
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,410
straight out of a data book you see

183
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,740
another way the junction to case works

184
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,260
this is probably more of a surface not

185
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,900
as a surface mount I'm sorry but you see

186
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,370
here we're not trying to get to a heat

187
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,289
sink as much as the heat sink in this

188
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,720
case is the PC board and maybe the

189
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,330
copper land underneath it but if you

190
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,830
look closely you're going to see a lot

191
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,389
of little Thetas and now you know what

192
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,870
that is so that's in a nutshell if we

193
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,240
then summarize here real quick we

194
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,389
started out with 38 degrees

195
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,550
ambient we added fifty point eight eight

196
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,830
and we came up with 96 point eight

197
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,530
degrees total when we start from the

198
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,970
junction until we get to the air

199
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,280
temperature if you remember we said that

200
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,050
it was 125 degree max so at two watts

201
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,610
using this heat sink you're okay alright

202
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,520
and finally let me show you the reward

203
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,650
for all of our great heat management

204
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,750
we're doing we put our heat sink we got

205
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,900
our bird poop in there and that is you

206
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,570
get more reliability so in this case

207
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,760
this is differing energy levels and

208
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,229
without going in Boltzmann's constant

209
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,680
everything um basically what this shows

210
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,230
is if I can lower the temperature 30

211
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,900
degrees I will have something that's 10

212
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,840
times more reliable so

213
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,840
you know put that back in picture with

214
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,000
all the other components they add up and

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,470
you get a final thing it says how

216
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,950
reliable something is so that that's it

217
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,540
that now you now you know thermal

218
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,060
equations equilibrium you can tell if a

219
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,550
parts getting too hot or not too hot you

220
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,440
you may burn your finger along the way I

221
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,320
know I have the links will be posted on

222
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,120
hackaday is along with some of these

223
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,280
diagrams maybe some of the Excel

224
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,870
spreadsheets or something so that you

225
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,480
can review this later as always get a

226
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,580
hold of me if you have any questions

227
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,950
we'll find a forum for doing that kind

228
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,320
of thing so again they'll hurt on behalf

229
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,940
of hackaday keep hacking
