1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,299
they'll hurt from hackaday today I'm

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:06,069
playing with a universal active filter

3
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:09,250
it's a pretty cool little thing it's

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,650
Universal as I said but this one's

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,050
programmable or controllable I should

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,059
say now I like that because it's a lot

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,190
easier to talk about the subject when

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,080
I'm not chasing all kinds of issues

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,660
around with the complexities of a filter

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,970
but first let's talk a little bit about

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,770
what a filter is and what it does a

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,250
filter is a way to select information

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,320
that we want or in this case a select

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
audio that we want it also rejects as

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,810
part of that but we tend to think in the

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,600
positive of what it accepts so in this

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,630
case I've shown a 3-way speaker like we

18
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,640
used to have in the old days and here

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,530
there's a woofer a mid-range and a high

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,079
ion and a tweeter in the speakers and

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,530
when audio comes in to what we call the

22
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,559
crossover its job is to send the low

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,050
frequencies down here to move this big

24
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,050
cone of air and get the power in there

25
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,449
but if you sent that same low frequency

26
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,240
up to the tweeter you'd probably blow it

27
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,600
out

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
so the crossover sends the lows down

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,549
here but then it sends the highs up to

30
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,130
the tweeter and and gets you nice

31
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,750
clarity in there but if it sends those

32
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,220
same highs to here and here it would

33
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,439
muddy the sound so the little highs go

34
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,119
to the tweeter the lows to the woofer

35
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,430
and then what's left in the middle you

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,170
know it's the mid-range and goes to the

37
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,510
mid-range driver well this is what it

38
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,630
would look like on a graph here if this

39
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,850
is low frequencies remember 20 to 20 K

40
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,950
they used to say in the old days the as

41
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,509
the frequencies are coming up in

42
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:39,130
frequencies and this is going to the

43
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,380
tweeter finally the high frequencies

44
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,150
start to come through and this is called

45
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,759
a high-pass when we do this and that's

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,220
this thing here the low-pass is where it

47
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,130
starts out or we're very close to starts

48
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,500
out it might do something like that

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,150
sending the low frequencies down to the

50
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,329
woofer but then it tapers off and and up

51
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:00,909
at the high range it's not passing him

52
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:03,070
by the way we call this a bandpass and a

53
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,869
band stop as a way to think of this and

54
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,640
then finally this is what we call a

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,230
bandpass filter where the lows don't get

56
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,519
through the highs don't get through but

57
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,019
the middles get through and so there's a

58
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,580
band associated with this

59
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,060
that this is allowed to pass a a band

60
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,030
stop or band reject would look like this

61
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,160
and we're not doing one of those today

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,900
but since we're talking the words that's

63
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,400
what it looks like let's start real

64
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,950
simple here with filter components what

65
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,260
makes up a component and here I've shown

66
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,820
just a simple low-pass with two

67
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,800
components and a simple high pass filter

68
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,100
with two components low-pass think of

69
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,200
this capacitor at like a battery it

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
stores voltage it resists a change in

71
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,300
voltage so if this were a battery and

72
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,740
you would like to connect it to a charge

73
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,900
of disconnect it connected it smooth

74
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,910
that out it'd be kind of like well I'm

75
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,190
still 12 volts and you're right across

76
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,830
me so I'm 12 volts even if the input is

77
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,070
just changed to 11 volts so low-pass

78
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,310
filter this resistor the the response to

79
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,940
this is a very linear to 2 pi RC 1 over

80
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,350
2 pi RC for this and so you make this

81
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,990
component bigger and it'll slow down you

82
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,730
make this component smaller and it'll

83
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,620
speed up make this component bigger and

84
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,360
it'll slow down make this come on so you

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,390
see there's a very linear relationship

86
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,610
high-pass filter there is no direct DC

87
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,070
path through this if there's a sudden

88
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,620
change on this end the change will go

89
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,300
away it'll see it for a second

90
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,000
whatever can get across this bridge but

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,160
then it'll come back to normal so only

92
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,620
those events those high frequency events

93
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,570
get through now the way I had to look

94
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,940
finally learn to think of a capacitor

95
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,790
was I was probably in fourth grade and I

96
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,200
had seen pictures and they'd show their

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
little electrons on one end I'm like

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,830
what but then I realized it's kind of

99
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,780
like pressure it's like when when the

100
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,360
signal hits it pushes a certain amount

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,880
across so it goes like that and then

102
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,070
comes back to its to its default and

103
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,750
once I start understanding that that the

104
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,840
more that this the the better the

105
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,850
capacitor was for conduction in other

106
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,310
words the lower the capacitor more and

107
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,810
more of these electrons could get bit

108
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,030
through but then they'd still at the end

109
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,410
the day come back to where they started

110
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,290
and so only high frequencies can get

111
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,450
through here a way to think about it to

112
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,760
tell the difference real quick is

113
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,800
low-pass is closest to DC as it gets 1

114
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,780
hertz 1/2 hertz well what's the next

115
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,720
thing well it's DC right there is no DC

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,500
path through here

117
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,360
there's a very filtered DC path right

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,330
here loves DC right so not to

119
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,130
oversimplify oh by the way we call this

120
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,990
this called a simple pole I call it a

121
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,870
real pole filter meaning that there's

122
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,980
nothing that is going there's nothing

123
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,350
unusual going to happen there is no gain

124
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,300
involved you will never get a voltage

125
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,070
out of this higher than what you put in

126
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,760
etc so the the down the downside of it

127
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,130
is it's simple but it's just got a real

128
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,010
rich gradual roll-off compared to what

129
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,840
we can get out of some other filters and

130
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm going to show you those before we

131
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,200
leave you we'll talk about Chevy chefs

132
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,940
and vessel filters and those kind of

133
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,320
things where you can get really

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,570
outrageous responses but you do it with

135
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,930
a lot of trade-offs so sloppy Oh RC

136
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,070
filters but hey they came first the part

137
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,740
I'm playing with today is a UAF 42

138
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,169
universal active filter 42 you can see

139
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,610
it here on the screen

140
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,650
it's an old part I just pulled it

141
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,110
because it's got an unusual property not

142
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,510
unusual it's got a cool property that

143
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,220
we're going to play with today and that

144
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,810
property is it keeps us from doing math

145
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,950
which excites me so here you can see the

146
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,960
the chip itself at the bottom we've got

147
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,110
op amps and op amp is gain and gain is

148
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,229
needed when you get funky with filters

149
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,210
otherwise it's gonna be that passive

150
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,850
slopey roll-off I showed you I don't

151
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,830
know if you can see this but here is

152
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,930
some of the math you'll see that it uses

153
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,460
the the the frequency domain known as s

154
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,330
and the this math is not trivial unless

155
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,950
you know how to do it here's a close-up

156
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,900
on an excerpt from that and from the

157
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,960
spec sheet and now the S domain has been

158
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,600
broken into regular math force but I

159
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,120
still I want to just have fun I don't I

160
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,860
don't want to have to do all this you

161
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,810
know all this math I just want to show

162
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,360
you what an active filter can do and how

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,640
to play with one so let's go back to the

164
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,900
workbench I'm going to show you how I

165
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,850
used this part in what was unusual about

166
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,250
it that allowed me to just get right

167
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,780
into playing with all right we're on the

168
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,270
bench here with the schematic of the UAF

169
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,510
42 and it's pretty much a self-contained

170
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,940
active filter

171
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,830
and by self-contained I mean it's got

172
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,200
some resistors and some capacitors in

173
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,140
built into it along with these op amps

174
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,240
and both the capacitors and resistors

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,590
have been have been trimmed by laser and

176
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,450
if you if you were to look closely at

177
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,010
the math that I showed you that we

178
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,230
didn't do you'll find that you can't

179
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,240
guess at these values when you go to

180
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,880
make a filter and these are nice round

181
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,000
values here but if the tolerance was off

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,700
by 10% on these you can get some very

183
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,970
strange effects whereas with an RC

184
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,010
filter you know the resistor gets

185
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,900
smaller it gets faster the capacitor

186
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,800
gets bigger it gets slower not in a

187
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,880
active active filter so it's got the

188
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,780
high-pass output here a low-pass output

189
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,250
here and you see I've drawn the symbol

190
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,380
for both and a band pass output here and

191
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,210
all's they are as taps in various places

192
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,120
on these three op amps as they talk to

193
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,630
each other and I'll show you that if you

194
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,340
think about the signal going through

195
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,040
this as as change in time a change in

196
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,340
phase the this op amps listening to the

197
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,290
future this one's listening to the past

198
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,670
thing you know that's the way I see

199
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,980
these things but really they're

200
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,750
interacting very carefully to produce

201
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,020
these these these outputs these bandpass

202
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,530
what makes this part usable here today

203
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,380
is that there are two external resistors

204
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,650
and when looking through the math you

205
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,520
see I found that if they're equal then I

206
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,700
can treat I can trim this thing's

207
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,430
frequency by only changing those two

208
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,450
resistors they do want to be equal or

209
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,070
again you get into a different area so

210
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,810
what I've done is I've got a dual gang

211
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,909
pot that I got from like digi-key and

212
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,219
I've made these resistors track each

213
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,610
other so here's the board here's our

214
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,200
dual gang pot and it's coupled into the

215
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,960
in place of these two resistors right

216
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,200
here and let's see what happens when we

217
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,110
put it on the scope so I'm going to show

218
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,000
you a piece of test equipment here that

219
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
we're going to use to

220
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,959
display the the effects of our filter

221
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,140
and this is just my old HP function

222
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,760
generator and it can do sine waves

223
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,769
square waves that kind of thing but what

224
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,320
I'm using it for today is what's called

225
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,990
a sweet frequency generator in other

226
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,670
words I'm going to sweep a frequency

227
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,269
starting from 60 I'm sorry starting from

228
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,910
80 Hertz and I'm going to go up to 5

229
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,920
kilohertz and then there's other things

230
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,800
like the amplitude you know I'm going to

231
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,279
set this for about half a volt of input

232
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,620
and that's going to give us the ability

233
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,220
to inject a variety or a sweep of

234
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,230
frequencies where we know the starting

235
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,029
and ending point and then we're going to

236
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,310
look at how the filter reacts so again

237
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,709
this is my sweet function on my function

238
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,350
generator i frozen a sweep here where

239
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,350
you can see it start and end this will

240
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,720
be moving around later a little bit look

241
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,760
a little noisier if i wanted you to get

242
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,709
intuitively what's going on and that is

243
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,839
here's the oscillator starting slow and

244
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,060
that's going faster and faster as this

245
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,220
goes and eventually as it goes all the

246
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,779
way across the screen it'll be going

247
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,329
that's its fastest so later you won't

248
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:06,130
see this as much you'll see just a

249
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,529
couple bumps of the slow part and it'll

250
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,110
look like a big smear but that's what

251
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,430
we're doing is we're starting an

252
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,290
oscillator at the low frequency and

253
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,520
telling it to go up to a high frequency

254
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,880
so here's our board with a probe

255
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,880
attached to view the high-pass output

256
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,510
and you can see as I turn the knob that

257
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:32,620
the high-pass part which is which is

258
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,190
here

259
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,350
is moving up and down up to the top of

260
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,550
the range so set here only high

261
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,440
frequencies are getting through out of

262
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,270
the sweep remember the sweep starts at

263
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,550
low frequency and goes up to a high

264
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,640
frequency alright on our bench here

265
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,680
we've got all the probes plugged in and

266
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,360
on the oscilloscope here I've got all

267
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,670
the channels firing and I've put it in

268
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,130
two dots mode just to help with the

269
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,100
display so some of this is a little

270
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,720
mushy but you'll see what I'm talking

271
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,680
about here on the left is where our low

272
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,770
frequency starts if you remember and

273
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,270
here in the blue this is the high-pass

274
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,910
filter because it starts not passing

275
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,430
much and then balloons up and then from

276
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,730
then on it is passing high pass this big

277
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,740
ol peak here is an artifact of the way

278
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,690
this circuit is operating right now and

279
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,560
a lot of times we call it a ripple or

280
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,270
just a non-linearity as far as I'm

281
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,400
concerned at the moment the middle one

282
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,590
is our bandpass you see that it's not

283
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,690
perfect it's got some residual amplitude

284
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,840
not near as much as the high and then

285
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,610
the the low pass you'll see on the

286
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,470
left-hand side it's pulling and slow

287
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,440
pass before it ripples out and then if I

288
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,930
try and move it so you'll see I'm moving

289
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,510
it down towards the low pass not much

290
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,940
low pass going on a lot of high pass or

291
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,410
I'm going to the right which is higher

292
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,380
in frequency and now I've got a lot of

293
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,420
low pass and I'm shortening up the the

294
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,220
high pass and meanwhile I'm moving

295
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,260
around in the middle is the bandpass so

296
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,730
we've got three different functions

297
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,090
coming out of out of this filter at the

298
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,370
same time so I'm going to stop there for

299
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,690
part one

300
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,760
let come on back for part two we're

301
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
going to stick some static signals and

302
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,850
let's stick to square wave in and see if

303
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,610
we can make a sine wave and let's pump

304
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,230
some music to it actually have a do the

305
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,290
crossover thing like we showed and to my

306
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,990
left you see the slow sweep frequency

307
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,850
will actually throw that on the speaker

308
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,710
see if we can hear what some of the sine

309
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,570
wave stuff does what it sounds like in

310
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,150
the harmonics so bill heard from

311
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,440
hackaday i'll tell you to keep on

312
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,550
hacking but I'm going to tell you to

313
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,079
come on back for part two actually
