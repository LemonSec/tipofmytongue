1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,650
they'll heard from hackaday we're

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,810
continuing a series on from gates to

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,420
FPGAs last time we talked about basic

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,070
logic we showed some of the symbols and

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,009
introduction to logic equations I got a

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,929
lot of feedback by of on the fact that I

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,970
jump around when I use them sorry

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,789
used many over the years right so today

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:21,930
we're going to talk about some of the

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,789
electrical properties I'm mostly about

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,260
DC we're not talking about the speeds

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,140
just yet but the voltages we use when we

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,349
deal with logic and it's gotten more

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,300
complicated but we're going to talk

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,070
about the technologies and the families

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,200
that help us define what voltage is what

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,390
and it'll also tell us a little bit

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,160
about noise and that kind of thing on

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,680
these lines so let's get started talking

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,690
about basic logic I've pulled out my old

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,239
TTL book what if who uses a data book

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,309
these days hey mines hardbound and you

23
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,160
can't have it it's mine so let's get

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,860
started with basic logic in TTL as I

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,120
mentioned today we're talking about

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,010
basic logic the electrical properties

27
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,440
and by that I mean the voltages of a

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,270
high and a low you know you make a

29
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,339
certain voltage and we call it a low you

30
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,110
make a certain voltage and we call it a

31
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,600
high it's actually all analog but we're

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,790
going to we'll get to that what we're

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,710
not talking about today is differential

34
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,600
where there's a push polling effect of

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,729
which we do for high-speed lines where

36
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,560
we use a pair of signals for each each

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,049
signal or a pair of wires conductors for

38
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,360
each signal we are doing single-ended

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,860
where there's a signal that goes high

40
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,650
for true and low for a for a false or a

41
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,189
zero we're not talking about the i/o

42
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,110
lines in micro processors and

43
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,110
peripherals today the this is strictly

44
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,630
that the the gates function will get to

45
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,460
i/o lines when we talk about processors

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,170
more anything so we're going to start by

47
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,560
talking about TTL as I mentioned and

48
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,759
before we talk about TTL we've got to

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,470
talk about where it came from there is a

50
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,200
major division in the technologies that

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,270
I will talk about I'm not talking about

52
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,049
ECL today I'm talking about TTL which

53
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,299
means transistors but it also means that

54
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,960
the the precautions the the voltage

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,810
ratings the voltage levels that go along

56
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,179
with anything that came from the TTL

57
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,510
line of chips of circuits and then

58
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,770
there's CMOS

59
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,620
mentoring metal-oxide-semiconductor it's

60
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,120
a I don't want to call it a different

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,710
religion but it's a different technology

62
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,720
and it's got its own things it's like

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,600
the ESD protections and latch ups but

64
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,460
then as they got better they could do

65
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,980
things that the transistor the regular

66
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,040
bipolar transistor logic could not do so

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,200
I'm gonna start talking on that no as

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,730
far as those two families I'm gonna

69
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,790
start talking by TTL and before we talk

70
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,130
about TTL I'm going to talk about RTL

71
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,320
and ETL so let's take a look at what

72
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,120
those are and I'll explain them all

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,980
right starting with the immediate

74
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,200
predecessors to TTL was RTL resistor

75
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,140
transistor logic where inputs were three

76
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,210
resistors into a transistor r/t and if

77
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,100
this looks like an analog circuit well

78
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,170
remember I said that's all analog we

79
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,810
choose to calls certain voltage is zero

80
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,580
and we choose to call certain voltage as

81
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,130
a one and it's the circuit trees job to

82
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,750
get better and better at only making

83
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,270
lows and high voltages and not hang

84
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,400
around in the middle I'll tell you well

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,560
as you can tell with the resistor it's

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,360
easy to make the voltages in the middle

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,340
we end up with resistor dividers so

88
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,330
there's a limit to what RTL will will do

89
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,070
so the next step was diode transistor

90
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,220
logic DTL and here a diode is a switch

91
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,750
as you may remember it's either on or

92
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,420
off and when it's off it's pretty off

93
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,360
and so we can couple several of these

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,370
together and get better performance the

95
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,140
resistors are never on or off it's just

96
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,930
summing currents right well that's this

97
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,410
is a switch diode transistor logic still

98
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,180
has limitations we need the resistor to

99
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,070
supply the current to the diode still

100
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,240
pretty analog ish finally TTL transistor

101
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,220
transistor logic no I'm not stuttering

102
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,800
it means that we use transistors to

103
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,959
switch and we use transistors to drive

104
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,770
and in this case you see the transistor

105
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,360
even does something kind of strange it's

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,239
called a multiple emitter transistor I

107
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,459
haven't seen these you know outside of

108
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,798
chips I mean you can certainly package

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,380
one up as a discrete part but they do it

110
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,180
inside a chip because they can it's all

111
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,280
just layout and in this case they've

112
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,750
created a

113
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,060
an anding function that becomes an and

114
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,520
function so TTL transistor transistor

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,040
logic so here's that here's the full

116
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,960
circuit for what we were just looking at

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,500
and this is a NAND gate like in a 7400

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,720
and so we see that we have a NAND

119
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,370
function both these need to be high low

120
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,970
high low and here starts the properties

121
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,990
of our of TTL which is when this

122
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,780
transistor is on its output voltage is

123
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,120
no regular transistor silicon

124
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,620
transistors 0.3 0.4 0.5 volts which is

125
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,330
less than a silicon diode well that's

126
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,950
what a transistor does when it turns on

127
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,540
it's actually a little bit magic it

128
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,430
makes a voltage drop less than the

129
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,790
diodes that are inside of it so pretty

130
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,310
good at sinking current down to make the

131
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,090
gavage go high however we've we've got a

132
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,640
voltage drop of a diode aren't 1.6 we've

133
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,410
got another you know point three point

134
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,000
four point five so we're up to our volt

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,620
and then we even have a resistor so when

136
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,020
the voltage is coming from here out to

137
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,810
the load it's minimal the TTL started at

138
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,020
400 micro amps let's talk about what TTL

139
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,150
compatible voltages mean and TTL

140
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,490
compatible means that the first TTL

141
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,860
chips used a voltage for a high and a

142
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,380
voltage for a low and they've basically

143
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,940
stuck with it if you want to be

144
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,250
compatible year after year as the new

145
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,040
chips came out there are two sets of

146
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,580
voltages an output of a TTL gate has an

147
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,070
output voltage output high of 2.4 which

148
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,050
means it'll make at least two point four

149
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,169
volts and it has a voltage output low of

150
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,020
0.5 meaning that it will be below at

151
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,270
least below 0.5 volts the input has two

152
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,130
other voltages similar but different

153
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,510
voltage input high of two volts voltage

154
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,070
input low of point eight volts so what

155
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,900
that means is we're going to make like

156
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,790
if we make a square wave it will be at

157
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,590
least as low at least as high and at

158
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,300
least it's low that's on the output on

159
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,460
the input we're looking for a square

160
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,660
wave to be at least these two voltages

161
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,370
so it's smaller well what happens why is

162
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,470
that smaller well that we could be

163
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,479
losing some voltage in things like the

164
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,390
IR drop of the lines not often there

165
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,630
could be due to the

166
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,160
load how many things we've got on it but

167
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,260
a lot of times it's due to noise and so

168
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,000
this is called the noise margin this

169
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
gives us room to have noise writing the

170
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,670
high in the low

171
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,340
so this is our TTL compatible voltages

172
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,950
nowadays we have TTL comes in multiple

173
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,690
voltages in the old days it was just

174
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,210
five volts we have voltages of just

175
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,940
three volts three point three these

176
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,130
voltages remain the same what happens is

177
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,650
the amount of room up here at the top

178
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,500
and the old days we we make two for 2.4

179
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,200
to 3 volts and we gotta kill 2 volts by

180
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,540
basically dissipating as heat these days

181
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,310
3 volts less to dissipate however

182
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,920
there's less Headroom in here so they

183
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,350
both both voltages use the same TTL

184
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,390
compatible voltages does this mean you

185
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,460
can hook a 3 volt to a 5 volt without

186
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,490
being careful no if if this happens to

187
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,610
make over 3 volts the output of a 5 volt

188
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,530
circuit happens to make more than 3

189
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,330
volts 3.3 volts for the input circuit

190
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,640
you can damage this circuit if this is a

191
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,180
3 volt circuit here so we need a if

192
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,250
you're going to do 5 volt to 3 volt you

193
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,800
need a higher voltage tolerant part and

194
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,940
we're going to talk about that later

195
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,300
talking about just TTL and digital

196
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,570
signals as for voltages is it's nice but

197
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,390
it's an oversimplification I want to

198
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,860
show you some real-world in this case

199
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,410
it's a simulated real world I have a

200
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,180
function generator built into my scope

201
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,890
but I've drawn what I've seen many many

202
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,830
times and that is this is what a single

203
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,020
may look like over you know when there's

204
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,670
repetition lots of singles bang bang

205
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,760
bang bang bang and they have different

206
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,440
characteristics depending on how they

207
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,270
were generated and even though you're

208
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,940
looking at just one trace the logic that

209
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,620
got there could could do several things

210
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,320
so here we see a square wave sort of

211
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,380
that's got issues not issues real life

212
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,930
things it's got under shoots it's got a

213
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,180
reflection halfway up the top there's

214
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,360
some overshoot if you look here in the

215
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,429
in in the ghosting images and a lot of

216
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,900
times with scopes that's what all's

217
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,429
you'll see is like some ghosts if it's

218
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,840
happening one out of a hundred times

219
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,479
I've colorized this hopefully you'll see

220
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,490
it a little better as certainly in real

221
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,370
life it's easier to see but if you

222
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,650
remember these thresholds and voltage

223
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,260
input low voltage input high suddenly

224
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,400
what do you

225
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,650
think when that voltage input low is

226
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,860
seeing this kind of thing going on here

227
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,020
or voltage input high if there's a

228
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,790
reflection right in the middle of it

229
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,880
acquiring the signal so I wanted to show

230
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,760
that it's it's not a clean thing and

231
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,160
that the way we look at these circuits

232
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,710
has to take into account if for example

233
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,840
if this rings at the top and it actually

234
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,480
falls out of the threshold input high

235
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,420
this it starts over right you you fell

236
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,310
out of the threshold and this this is

237
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,110
normal this happens all the time just

238
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,100
wanted to show you some real life before

239
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,280
I do a final summary of the bipolar TTL

240
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,780
families that we've been talking about I

241
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,890
want to talk about what a Schottky

242
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,690
family is I'm sure you've heard of that

243
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,570
well a Schottky family addresses a

244
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,060
problem that they had in the early TTL

245
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,370
devices which was the transistors once

246
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,990
turned on would turn on and then

247
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,640
something would saturate all these

248
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,270
charge carriers would build up and

249
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,500
before you could turn the transistor

250
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,300
back off you'd have to drain off those

251
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,910
charged extra excessive charge carriers

252
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,440
kind of like when you go fishing and

253
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,270
you've got too much slack in the line

254
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,680
you have to reel in the slack before you

255
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,900
can reel in the fish so what they did

256
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,720
was they put a diode and it happens to

257
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
be a Schottky cut diode because we need

258
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,130
the very low forward voltage drop

259
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,510
between the base and collector and this

260
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,040
the transistor will turn on and then

261
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,870
stop it won't just keep going into

262
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,210
saturation they'll then redraw the

263
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,040
symbol like this to represent the fact

264
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,650
it's a Schottky paired device like this

265
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,670
and then a whole gate made of these

266
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,530
where all the transistors are kept out

267
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,630
of saturation starts to enjoy some of

268
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,190
the speed benefits and then they do

269
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,040
other things to lower the power and do

270
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,240
some other things and that's where we

271
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,770
get variations like little power of

272
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,810
Schottky so let's take a look at the

273
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,590
families finally here I want to talk

274
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,140
very briefly about the different bipolar

275
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,810
TTL families I need to be briefed or

276
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,330
it'll get boring real fast so by the way

277
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,340
when you see a 54 that's just a milspec

278
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,350
version of a 74 so we're talking about

279
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,440
the 74 s right here was the plain-jane

280
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,460
TTL kind of right in the middle of the

281
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,650
field for is speed which is in this

282
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,630
direction and power dissipation which is

283
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,070
in this direction the the most used part

284
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,390
after that then really became the

285
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,110
low-power shocky so we we had low power

286
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,480
and reasonable speed actually about the

287
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,790
same speed as the TTL and then on the

288
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,770
opposite end we had shot keys these

289
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,750
things were noisy when you used him but

290
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,250
boy did they get the job done it was

291
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,460
like 40 pound bowling ball but then the

292
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,650
ASI van shocky and advanced low-power

293
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,100
shocky the ALS is a great part what you

294
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,740
don't see here was the fast family the f

295
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,780
parts which we called which were the

296
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,690
fairchild advanced Schottky TTL s and

297
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,450
and they were also really good they had

298
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,860
some different drive characteristics

299
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,900
than the LS and sometimes a little less

300
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,400
noise for the kind of things we were

301
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,930
doing I'm going to wrap it up there for

302
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,450
this time this has been more about the

303
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,570
bipolar TTL and so as we get into the

304
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,190
lower voltages that you know we've been

305
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,660
talking about the five volt but that the

306
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,520
lower voltages the three-point-three

307
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,580
uses the same levels but a lot of times

308
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,920
these are what we call bi CMOS devices

309
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,020
so next time we'll talk about CMOS the

310
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,910
different thresholds they use and then

311
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,740
we'll talk about the lower voltages and

312
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,370
the benefits of CMOS these days CMOS is

313
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,900
pretty prevalent in almost everything we

314
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,540
do with the logic so Bill heard from

315
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,750
hackaday we'll see you next time we'll

316
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,520
talk about CMOS we'll finish up DC

317
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,949
electrical characteristics gates to FPGA
