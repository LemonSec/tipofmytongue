1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
bill heard from hackaday and today we're

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,529
out in my garage and we're going to be

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,060
doing something a little bit different

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,980
we're going to be making a cast making a

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,559
mold without today and then I'm going to

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,590
cast it with today's equivalent the

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,780
plaster of Paris when we were young I

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,609
think that the stuff sets up better and

9
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,699
things like that so some of you may know

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,160
that I lost something about a year and a

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,060
half ago I took a finger off I caught my

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,949
wedding ring I stepped off of a ladder

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,470
16 inches my wedding band got caught on

14
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,329
a nail hit and it stripped my finger

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,460
right off the bone so what I'm

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,890
interested in doing is I'm going to work

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,440
with James Hobson and rich Brimmer from

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,010
hackaday

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,050
there are a couple of the contributors

20
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,210
slash engineers Mechanical Engineers and

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,160
I'm not good at mechanical stuff

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,350
especially it's hard to work on your

23
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,579
hand when it's your hand you're trying

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,059
to do so to allow him to help me I'm

25
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,250
going to be sending him the cast of my

26
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,020
hand and actually some other pieces that

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,960
I already have them and maybe we can

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
make a prosthetic that you know scares

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,409
small children or has a built-in

30
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,210
Bluetooth or salad fork or something

31
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,330
we'll figure it out so I've only done

32
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,080
this once before and it turned out great

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,060
but I also did that for my my pristy

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,490
c---eight ologist prosthesis beef yeah

35
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,840
that guy also so so this is really a

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,970
kind of a mark too and hopefully I hit

37
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,360
all the same combinations of about 1/8

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,310
and water as I don't remember how I do

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,700
so one quick note I'm using just tap

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,640
water I'm using a little warm so that I

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,470
don't get trapped with my hand in the

42
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,229
box and if you need deionized water

43
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,119
where you live or or at least cleaner

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,630
water when I use and I use this in my in

45
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,270
my sonic cleaner after I do PC boards

46
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,829
and stuff this is a mr. clean spotless

47
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:57,390
carwash system and there's a cartridge

48
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,890
in here with a couple of different

49
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,509
chemicals in it actually a couple

50
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,299
filters I should say in chemicals and it

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,009
does pretty good you can definitely tell

52
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,299
the water comes out with the less

53
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,340
surface tension than you might see and

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,340
it really does make my car spotless so

55
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,489
poor man's a

56
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,489
clean your water if you need it so I

57
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,530
guess the other thing I would say is so

58
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,000
if you're going to stick your hand in a

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,840
box and be trapped with your hand in a

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,989
box make sure that you have food handy

61
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,819
in case you're trapped and you you need

62
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:30,489
to survive for a while I have my cell

63
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,049
phone I'm sure the battery's dead but

64
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:33,400
maybe I can throw the cell phone and

65
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,469
break a window and shout for help that

66
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,939
kind of thing so with all that said

67
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:40,180
let's throw abandon to the wind no let's

68
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,780
abandon all hope no let's let's get

69
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,620
started so they say roughly for alginate

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,030
101 I've seen 1 2 2 1 2 3 I don't know

71
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,340
so we're going to go with about 1.5 to 1

72
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,569
and we're going to see how well that

73
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,019
works so I've got my box I'm going to

74
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,540
use that's actually from a I coated it

75
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,010
would take because I didn't like the box

76
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,359
structure itself looked like it would

77
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,879
leak before my hands oh one other thing

78
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,609
is they they do recommend you you mix

79
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,489
the alginate well I may try mixing with

80
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,359
my hands

81
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,060
this is a drill with a little stirring

82
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,849
thing obviously the trick there is to

83
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:24,250
remember not to try both their hand in

84
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,199
the automation at the same time could

85
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,569
lose more fingers so I like to do

86
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,549
fiberglassing and I've done some

87
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,040
automotive painting for well for

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,379
fiberglass projects and stuff so I got a

89
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,930
bunch of these laying around I wish they

90
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,489
were bigger for this project but that's

91
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,709
what I'm using to measure I'm going to

92
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,889
put about 1.5 liters of alginate by

93
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,949
volume no flour sifters or anything

94
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,620
we're not getting crazy here and I'm

95
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,040
going to add that much water and then a

96
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,810
little more and see where that leads us

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,560
no you fool no I think we're okay so far

98
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,220
you know what let's see how it goes

99
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,728
before I

100
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,420
now one of the things is I can tell it's

101
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,400
more the in theory I'm already wetting

102
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,320
my hand so that the alginate should

103
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,460
stick to it well and our work life here

104
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,140
is supposed to be only a couple minutes

105
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,210
but as I said you know I've got bananas

106
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,850
and some food sources or if I do get

107
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,310
stuck out here a while I guess I could

108
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,990
always carry the Box inside but

109
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,560
Engineers don't think like that all

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,370
right actually I'm liking what I see so

111
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,180
if you can

112
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,229
and I'm gonna make another batch real

113
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:28,830
quick so I learned well actually it

114
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,160
wasn't me my the guy that helped me my

115
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,380
with my post esis the first time which I

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,699
actually don't care for so I don't use

117
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,550
he ran shark on his also and so he tried

118
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,009
to mix a second batch too late and

119
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,289
alginate won't stick to itself if it's

120
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,380
already cured so I'm trying to hold my

121
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,169
hand in what in EMS what we call the the

122
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,539
natural position of the hand you know

123
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:55,710
when they're broke they hang like this

124
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,949
but normal ones like that and try and

125
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,990
have my finger spritz so that James and

126
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,530
rich have something that they can work

127
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,300
with as far as getting in on the finger

128
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,400
itself so there was some talk of

129
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,009
removing other fingers to put in the the

130
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,259
nuclear cells and stuff like that but

131
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,639
we're first going to see if we can get

132
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,960
it working you should have a sticker it

133
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,320
says no no Arduino on board if we go

134
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,889
processor will go wide 64 bit minimum so

135
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,469
the trick here is can bill keep up idle

136
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,139
banter throughout the alginate setting

137
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,020
process and the answer is no this is I'm

138
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,639
told to keep these videos down to eight

139
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,759
minutes so probably shortly you're going

140
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,250
to see me standing there as if it's

141
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,789
already set up the magic of web chaos oh

142
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,650
I just realize I lost all feeling in my

143
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,780
finger that oh wait that's the missing

144
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,690
fingers nevermind it's quite possible I

145
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,210
should have shaved my wrist I see the

146
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,690
hair is getting darker yeah should have

147
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,030
been doing this all along probably to

148
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,590
knock some of the air bubbles out of it

149
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,590
one trick is that you can't form a sheet

150
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,360
that you can't pull your hand out so

151
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,580
going to curled or something well that

152
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,840
probably would go through this stuff

153
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,060
pretty pliable but trying to trying to

154
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,479
get too crazy won't work I can feel it

155
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,470
stiffening up here

156
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm gonna focus on that when I'd be

157
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,210
fighting my prestigious is actually a

158
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,660
big blue block like a Minecraft off to

159
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,790
my left you'll see my three axis mill

160
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,970
machine I built but actually I just used

161
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,160
a monitor to watch Netflix while I'm out

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,410
here most of the time okay it's kind of

163
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,090
cool you ever see pudding where where

164
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,650
the pudding sets up but you can see

165
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,390
where the air bubbles were we're at the

166
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,690
popped air bubble pudding stage it's

167
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,370
starting to burn now I think I may have

168
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,160
used holy water and as you can see here

169
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,890
this is already I'm not gonna close up

170
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,090
I'm going to try and keep the camera

171
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,250
from getting dirty but if as you can see

172
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,260
it's no longer really liquid it's got

173
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,440
some little to it oh yeah that comes

174
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,020
right at least my arm hairs in place so

175
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,790
that's I was thinking about sending

176
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,920
James actually two of two versions of

177
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,710
the hand one with a profane gesture but

178
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,210
I actually don't have enough alginate

179
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,980
but I was kind of packed so he had to go

180
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,660
through the profane one to get to the

181
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,650
normal one okay I can feel it now start

182
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,200
to lift off of my hand

183
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,060
I've already peeled it off of my wrist

184
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,460
here of leaving all my arm hairs in

185
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,150
place it is a strange sensation and in

186
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,280
my case my nerves were damaged such that

187
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,260
the nerd they're not the same place oh I

188
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,809
mean I'm getting nerves firing from my

189
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,690
toes and stuff but let's see and there

190
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,150
you have it and we have a whole cavity

191
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,790
in there that looks like in theory my

192
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,710
hand

193
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,360
probably the blue tape you can see the

194
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,860
weight of it is deformed that the

195
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,560
cardboard so the blue tape appears to

196
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,120
have been a good choice

197
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,650
and already we can go upside-down and it

198
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,240
doesn't come in so this is this is what

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,980
we're looking like for the alginate now

200
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,540
at this point kinda looks like silicon

201
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,440
if you've ever played with the RTV

202
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,940
two-part silicon and we've got some of

203
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,410
that here we may be playing with that

204
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,710
later this year okay so next I have to

205
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,890
pour a plaster in here and then we'll

206
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,870
actually break the alginate mold to

207
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,520
break it away from the plaster and

208
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,620
that'll be the final product

209
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,240
I think Bert's a mold or a caste uh so I

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,040
wish I could show you the box the

211
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,620
alginate came in but actually I got this

212
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,360
last year and I don't and otherwise it's

213
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,360
just a powder in a bag real light powder

214
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,970
almost looks like diatomaceous earth

215
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,220
which we use on my we have a rescue

216
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,410
Turkey and we do that to get to the

217
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,170
mites off of him as far as the casting I

218
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,870
just looked up Amazon I looked for some

219
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,270
and I've got this is called perfect cast

220
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,850
and you know I'm guessing that it

221
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,280
doesn't shrink as much and maybe not get

222
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,100
as hot or cold or whatever as it used to

223
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,310
and around here I don't know about your

224
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,900
Home Depot but they were very stingy

225
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,520
with their stir sticks so I went and

226
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,020
bought myself like a thousand of these

227
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,000
ones all right she put a mail box up I

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,840
send you stir sticks wouldn't they find

229
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,400
you see the stick getting shorter as I

230
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,410
do it you know it's a real caustic next

231
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,720
no I'm just dying to used my drill

232
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,670
starter but then I'd have a big mess to

233
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,950
clean up and kind of the way I like to

234
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,180
work is I I like to throw away the all

235
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,100
the stuff it once it's dirty I'm not

236
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,650
into cleaning as much so I tend to buy a

237
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,980
lot of the the throwaway brushes the

238
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,590
foam brushes and even buy you know like

239
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,710
a 20 pack of two inch wide or one inch

240
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,800
wide brush this one I'm doing

241
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,550
fiberglassing now the good news here

242
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:05,160
least I think it can do it is that if I

243
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,100
have a shy a little bit I can add some

244
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,890
in theory will test that theory because

245
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,690
this does never looks right until you do

246
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,480
it now I'm once again I'm tapping to get

247
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,710
the air bubbles out I don't think that a

248
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,810
couple air bubbles will affect James and

249
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,610
what he's doing but with that said you

250
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,310
know it could screw up the outline of

251
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,060
something if a bubble and the edge

252
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,390
intercepted and there we go we're just

253
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,030
going to we've got the cavity that just

254
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,510
you saw where my hand used to be and I

255
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,780
guess that makes sense to not just throw

256
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,220
it in there but to make sure we get all

257
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,380
the fingers filled and not trap air in

258
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,670
them oh it's so close i've got mix a

259
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,930
little bit more but all right so where

260
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,240
you can't see it it's within an inch of

261
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,490
the top so here I mixed up a batch a

262
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,170
second batch and I'm just topping it off

263
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,540
my concern is if I have any big air

264
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,000
bubbles down in the fingers all right

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,620
we're gonna let that set I'm going to

266
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,080
start cleaning up so in an hour to clean

267
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,440
up I should be back where I started and

268
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,730
we'll pull the alginate off see what

269
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,420
this looks like all right let's take a

270
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,610
look how dirty we made the desk see what

271
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,100
this mold looks like so I'm trying to

272
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,770
not tear it up too much but you know you

273
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,830
can't really reuse these but still after

274
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,780
everything you do to it you don't want

275
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,290
to tear it up plus I don't want to break

276
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,270
the plaster so actually I should be a

277
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,130
little more so that's wrong

278
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,280
yes there we go all right James they'll

279
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,180
be going in a box to you actually there

280
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,710
you go

281
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,620
this will be going in a box to you and I

282
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,950
appreciate any help you can give me uh

283
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,410
getting back my digits

284
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,030
it'll hurt signing off from a hackaday

285
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,120
somewhere in balmy southern New Jersey

286
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,080
high-five
