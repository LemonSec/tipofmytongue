1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,130
bill heard from hackaday today I want to

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,560
show you my little complex programmable

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,410
logic device module I built and then

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,090
we're going to rev it here's the board

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,309
it's on actually one inch centers it was

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,770
meant to be pluggable and it's got a

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,369
socket so that I can take AJ Lee one of

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,180
these basically which is can be surface

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,180
mounted but it can also be socketed so

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,490
the idea here was that I can plug this

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,488
in as a module and still do this as a

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,030
through-hole project or as a kit and

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,440
still you know and have this socketed

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,320
and do in circuit programming and by in

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,230
circuit programming we mean using one of

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,469
these which will cost you $50 if you get

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,480
it from digit key as a true I'll tear

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,300
apart this is a clone I got off eBay and

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,010
I think we're going to actually do a

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,820
project of how to make these as you know

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,800
how to make these ourselves or how to

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,780
program them if you were to take a board

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,229
like this and put it on top of like an

24
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,119
Arduino or something used Arduino to

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,180
program it so here's our little CPL D

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,060
board I'm talking about so why do a CPL

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,799
D board what was the idea behind it well

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,400
I wanted to do a something that you

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,140
could use to replace a piece of

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,820
programmable logic let's say you can't

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,040
get a chip anymore or you just wanted to

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
experiment and wanted to plug this into

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,670
a solderless breadboard or into your

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,360
circuit and have a small programmable a

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,250
piece of logic right and that was the

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,549
idea as such this board that I'm showing

37
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,710
you here today can run off 5 volts or

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,610
3.3 volts its EE based EE electrically

39
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,829
erasable meaning once I program it with

40
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,750
one of these it keeps its program it

41
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,189
doesn't have to program them every time

42
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,220
some of these other objects here that's

43
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,170
a program every time you turn it on it's

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,930
part of living with the bigger bigger

45
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,299
the bigger devices here so again it's

46
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,710
mostly through hold this is also

47
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,000
available as a 64 macro cell device or a

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,979
32 macro cell device and I've actually

49
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,799
done an NTSC generator entire camera

50
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,628
generator talking twenty years ago but

51
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,930
inside the 64 macro cell device so and I

52
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,040
wrote it in a 8

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,930
which is kind of obsolete but it's

54
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,489
Altera's high-level descriptive language

55
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,640
so when I'm done I'll print this project

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,459
up on github but it's kind of useless

57
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,239
for what I thought I'd use it for let me

58
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,540
show you what I mean now the idea was to

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,180
plug it into a solderless breadboard now

60
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,030
I don't use these much and so I didn't

61
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,340
know that if I made this one inch on

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,220
centers that I would only have one row

63
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,329
left to plug my cables into so and and I

64
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,129
chose one inch because of the clearance

65
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:50,340
issues here the socket to the pins

66
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,310
underneath so I'm going to try and rev

67
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,959
this to make it see if I can fit a

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,060
solder to the solderless breadboard so

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,069
right off the bat I blew it

70
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,720
I've lit in a way I never thought I'd

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,760
blood probably blew it in a way I never

72
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,819
would as a true design engineer you know

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,109
as opposed to trying to show you

74
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:08,939
something here in a video because we

75
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,500
would have designed this I wouldn't have

76
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,669
designed this for a solver less

77
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,099
breadboard here's the schematic for the

78
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,470
simple CPL D board that I was just

79
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,510
showing you and before I go through the

80
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,669
details of what went through my mind as

81
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,500
I placed each part and there's not a lot

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,510
but I'll give you kind of the the

83
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,729
engineers view of each and every pin

84
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,000
like why this one's floating for example

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,260
but I wanted to show you i'm now i'm

86
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,239
using Proteus i'm gonna do a project

87
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,269
tunis go for all you Eagle fans Proteus

88
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,489
is just was my choice for something

89
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,440
cheap and I could do bigger boards than

90
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,840
I could in Eagle and I didn't have to

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,519
worry about if I sold the boards later

92
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,579
so that was my choice I do have a 3d

93
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,940
view but you see that it's looking kind

94
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,970
of ugly right now and so part of doing a

95
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,229
3d view based board is to find the 3d

96
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:03,180
objects and and populate it

97
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,459
I do have simple pins for down the edges

98
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,280
here but you see that for example I'm

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,349
going to do the dual 2 by 5 header for

100
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,918
the in circuit programming and I will

101
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,769
post a list of where I get some of my 3d

102
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,810
objects from because I personally don't

103
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,310
have time to make them right now in my

104
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,550
schedule so I find objects people have

105
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,870
already made on the Internet

106
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,340
download them and I put them in a

107
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,680
directory for here we go to the object

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,530
part the footprint that I want to create

109
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,500
a 3d object for and I go 3d bottles and

110
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,470
I'm either I'm using either step or iges

111
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,639
files STP files or iges here's the

112
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,650
director I put them and I know for

113
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,110
example that I have a little collection

114
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,449
of the dual row headers pin headers dual

115
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:05,520
row two by five and now it's a matter of

116
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,789
making it fit to the board correctly so

117
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:11,610
I'm a first adjusting offset in one to

118
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,210
one direction and you see I'm not quite

119
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,400
centered so I'm going to go ahead and

120
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,800
and just Center it a little bit more and

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,419
that looks good to me

122
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,720
click OK and go back to our 3d

123
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,820
visualizer and you see that now it looks

124
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,380
like the header that's actually in use

125
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,330
so I'm going to go ahead and do this for

126
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,490
my socket and for this part right here

127
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,289
I've added the two additional parts I've

128
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,840
got my PLCC plastically to chip carrier

129
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,440
which handles the J lead device the the

130
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,340
actual PL D that you saw earlier and

131
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,050
it's an okay symbol a lot of times

132
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,580
you'll actually see the metal pins in

133
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,250
there as metal colored and then I've got

134
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,740
my five point five by seven millimeter T

135
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,190
Co package you know just dropped in here

136
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,900
we'll come back to this because some of

137
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,669
the things I need to do to rev this part

138
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,590
are visible on this layer but let's get

139
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,690
back to the schematic so obviously the

140
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,690
star of the show is the actual CPL D

141
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,270
part itself which is right here

142
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,120
I made this symbol and and look let's

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,849
talk about symbols you're going to have

144
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,710
to make your own almost all of the time

145
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,780
it seems to me I mean there's great

146
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,909
libraries everything like that but on

147
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,830
any one project I've always found myself

148
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,710
making

149
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,390
so it's just one of those things I just

150
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,250
know I got to do so I just bite the

151
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,230
bullet and do it now with that said

152
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,420
looking at the symbol and I did this

153
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,940
board a few months back and I've already

154
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,990
forgotten about it I must have used the

155
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,840
bsdl interpreter to create the symbol

156
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,630
and what that is is there's a form at it

157
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,000
that sort of standardized that you can

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,350
download from a lot of different

159
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,150
websites or different parts suppliers

160
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,760
and they will help make symbols is it

161
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,490
great well it's okay especially if

162
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,230
you've got hundreds of pins and you at

163
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,940
least want to get the pins accounted for

164
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,640
Eagle does this you know Proteus does

165
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,530
this Altium although all the big

166
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,770
companies have bsdl imports and you've

167
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,200
got options like how many packages to

168
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,150
put it in things like that so it's

169
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,280
actually a very helpful tool when I did

170
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,830
mine here it looks to me like I did it I

171
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,630
let it go ahead and do it alphabetically

172
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,850
and that's not the greatest organization

173
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,550
so if I were to do this again which I'm

174
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,740
thinking about doing I would go ahead

175
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,860
and make the part look like it's actual

176
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,600
footprint here and that'd be for

177
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,490
debugging too it's you know like you you

178
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,500
want to know pin sevens here on the

179
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,240
corner and if the schematic shows it

180
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,950
that way that just makes it simple I can

181
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,230
do this because this part is small so

182
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,820
and the one thing I want to show that's

183
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,050
always important when you're dealing

184
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,290
with socketed chips especially the LCC

185
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,180
series is where is pin one really

186
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,570
altaira puts pin one in the center not

187
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,490
in the corner so that's just something

188
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,590
to be aware of you know if you end up

189
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,240
making your own footprint the other

190
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,070
thing with regard to making big symbols

191
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,810
is what do you do with power and ground

192
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,320
now I like to show power and ground I

193
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,510
just do especially if I've got multiple

194
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,480
sheets I'll put I'll put it on a

195
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,070
separate sheet I can show the

196
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,360
relationship to the decoupling

197
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,660
capacitors I can check manually check

198
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,400
that all my pin numbers are accounted

199
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,559
for because if when you make this part

200
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,120
and you've got invisible power and

201
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,890
ground and mind sort of invisible it's a

202
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,020
gray mishmash right there that was your

203
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,850
chance to catch it you you may not catch

204
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,860
it till you go to PC board or at least

205
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,600
when you're carefully checking the PC

206
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,290
board so you do have a choice between

207
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,520
what they call hidden power and ground

208
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,280
pins and actually showing them if you do

209
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,149
them hidden you

210
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,589
configuring your power rails things like

211
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,949
that so that the system knows what VCC

212
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:04,220
is what 1.8 volts is etc the other thing

213
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,800
here is this is the 40 pin connector on

214
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,880
the bottom of the board

215
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,610
and I just grabbed a connector like an

216
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,009
IDC cable and really it doesn't

217
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:15,019
represent the layout of the board which

218
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:16,940
is more of a dip where would be 1 2 3 4

219
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,540
instead of 1 2 3 4 like this so to rev

220
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,490
this board I would repin this out so it

221
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,230
more physically represents what I'm

222
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,360
trying to do here's the self-contained

223
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,639
oscillator which has a crystal and the

224
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,680
amplifier circuitry all built in it you

225
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,630
can make your own crystal oscillators we

226
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,120
could do a whole episode on that these

227
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,630
days

228
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,519
I've taken to showing the voltage of

229
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,800
parts when I'm into a multi volt

230
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,470
situation I here this oscillator that I

231
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,959
picked out is good from one point 6 to 5

232
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,680
point 5 volts mean in 1 point 8 to 5 and

233
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,180
how can I do that it can do it because

234
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,980
it's CMOS if you remember us talking

235
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,339
about CMOS the output will be a

236
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,990
proportion of the voltage itself it just

237
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,759
happens to be compatible with TTL

238
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,810
edibles and what this CPL D is looking

239
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,189
for but one other thing to note is if

240
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,500
this wasn't CMOS and depending on

241
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,259
technology or if this was a bigger more

242
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,209
complicated board where the clock went

243
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,300
multiple places I almost always drop a

244
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,449
series resistor I start with 22 ohms up

245
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,089
near this package later I can put I can

246
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,560
short it back out if I want to or

247
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,079
whatnot but it's there to handle

248
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,149
reflections and if this was a real hard

249
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,009
drive in part and these used to be not

250
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,600
the CMOS is but they what we had

251
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,089
available or if it goes to different

252
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,829
branches where you can't control the

253
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,240
reflections then you'll need an a

254
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,699
reflection absorbing resistor usually

255
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:42,350
it's the clock as the highest hardest

256
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,810
driving signal in the circuit not so

257
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,060
much on this little ditty here the other

258
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,759
thing we see is I've got the enable pin

259
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,500
there is one on this part almost always

260
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,170
these days and I haven't connected it to

261
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,870
anything and that is my preference let

262
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,519
me show you the datasheet first off in

263
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,350
the datasheet first thing my eyes do is

264
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,660
I go to double check again the voltage

265
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,660
it's just habit I hate trying to think

266
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,160
I'm going for the wrong

267
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,680
part down here you'll always find the

268
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,279
logic for the unable somewhere on the on

269
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,399
the data on the datasheet and in this

270
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,620
case it shows us the inhibit and it

271
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,259
shows us that when it's open it's active

272
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:25,100
it has an internal pull up so I use that

273
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,399
I don't tie this pin why well I don't

274
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,110
have to worry that I tie it to the wrong

275
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,000
voltage I think that happened once

276
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,240
eighteen years ago second I don't like

277
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,629
tying a pin directly to a VCC rail I

278
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,509
just don't I almost always use a

279
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:45,829
resistor 10k 1k whatever for two reasons

280
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:48,740
one this voltage if if there's a

281
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,720
capacitor here and the voltage driving

282
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,100
this has a greater load or there's

283
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,199
distance I don't ever want the voltage

284
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,209
on the in on this pin to be greater than

285
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,949
the voltage on this pin on this little

286
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:00,439
circuit it wouldn't happen but that's me

287
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,990
I don't I like to current limit all pins

288
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,810
that are tied to rails also if I ever

289
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,990
want to tie this to a different logic

290
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,779
level I don't have a direct piece of

291
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,339
wire some time or a direct piece of

292
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:14,990
copper sometimes buried on an inner

293
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,029
layer I have a resistor which I can

294
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,550
either lift or I can run a wire to so

295
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,880
again have it if I do tie a pin to VCC I

296
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,769
almost always use a pull-up resistor

297
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:27,139
back to the board to finalize here the

298
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,079
changes I would make if I rev this and

299
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,149
you know I did try and make this mostly

300
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,360
through hole but the TCO just ends up

301
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,730
having to be surface mount if you saw

302
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,139
the size of the can of the through-hole

303
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,300
it just be all wasted space and they're

304
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,970
actually more expensive these days I did

305
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,430
put a surface mount LED I think they

306
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,870
look better of all things and the

307
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,120
resistor for it ended up surface mount I

308
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,339
may make this through-hole let me know

309
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,559
in the comments if is that we're trying

310
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,569
to strict strict lead a through-hole for

311
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:00,439
a kit or are people get enough that you

312
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,399
don't mind tack in a little 805 cases to

313
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,680
do some of these the other errors I made

314
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,420
here I would put a bigger pin one

315
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,589
detector here so a big pin one symbol so

316
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:14,899
that I know where how this thing plugs

317
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,839
into something likewise the part here

318
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,449
itself I would put a pin one symbol here

319
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:20,870
for the

320
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,210
troupe in one of the chip and then make

321
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,490
accent this beveled edge here a little

322
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,890
more same with the TCO I ended up

323
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,140
changing the case size and I'm covering

324
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,380
up the pin1 detector and also on the in

325
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,990
circuit programming plug I actually did

326
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,700
plug it in backwards my first time

327
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,160
looking at it so I'd put a big ol circle

328
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,560
here for pin one now

329
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,370
there's a I need a power and ground

330
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,130
reference for hook my scope probes to if

331
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,350
nothing else so I was thinking about

332
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,779
putting a couple pins here for power and

333
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:56,330
ground and actually they'd give me the

334
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,190
ability to plug in a separate power and

335
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,350
ground instead of trying to clip to the

336
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,330
bottom of this thing instead of trying

337
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,400
to clip to these with my grounds and

338
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,190
power which kind of just doesn't do it

339
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,770
for me but I notice I changed the colors

340
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,210
to look like OSH Park because that's

341
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,250
where I'm going to buy the next one so

342
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,760
some basically out differences I made

343
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,410
that mistake year over the years just

344
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,600
over and over again when I look at my

345
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,360
initial PCB layout I think I see a big

346
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,550
enough pin once and when I go to use it

347
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,640
myself I don't here's the CP LD module

348
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,640
plugged into my little USB blaster clone

349
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,580
I've got power on the corners actually

350
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,870
this is a 3.3 volt version and let's see

351
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,290
if we can see it in the software Roy

352
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,630
okay when I say software what I'm

353
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,190
referring to is the development

354
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,709
environment in this case altaira they

355
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,320
have free software called Cortis to the

356
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,470
web edition now altaira dropped support

357
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,779
in their newest software for these older

358
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,790
devices why am i using an older device

359
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,260
was I said it's through it got a

360
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,779
through-hole compatible version it's 5

361
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,260
volts and it's EE programmable meaning I

362
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,390
program it I don't have to like flash it

363
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,160
every time it turns on I don't have to

364
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,400
download a new code into it so and and

365
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,580
it's a useful little part so you do need

366
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,920
cordis to the web Edition version 9.1 is

367
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,650
my recommendation it's also got cool you

368
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,870
can draw logic you can do timing with it

369
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,580
and things that they also dropped later

370
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,630
so there's the the link for cordis to

371
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,519
the web edition

372
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,740
and the very first test is I'm going to

373
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,750
go to the programmer and see if it sees

374
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:44,389
my board and two things one it sees my

375
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:47,000
blaster and it's always good like again

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,130
I'm using a clone so it's especially

377
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,440
good at saw it and - it does see the

378
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,940
board so that means that I didn't hose

379
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,449
the PLD as a whole I did I didn't blow a

380
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:02,959
VCC pin or a programming pin when I say

381
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,740
software this this is an old part I told

382
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,279
you that

383
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,310
well altaira stock dropped support for

384
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,660
these max 7000 and again the max 7000

385
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,759
was through-hole or something I could

386
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,620
put in a through-hole socket it was 5

387
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,509
volt had a 5 volt version the voltage

388
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:23,589
just started dropping after that and

389
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,380
it's it's EE programmable you program at

390
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,269
once you can reuse it as the parts got

391
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:31,819
newer they stop being so flashy so flash

392
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:36,350
based so you need cordis to web Edition

393
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,959
it's free software it's free software so

394
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,850
you know III haven't looked to see if

395
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,880
the open source is applied to this

396
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,120
because free accounts good enough in my

397
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,269
book I took the clock input pin these

398
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:58,339
parts do have a dedicated clock that

399
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:01,069
they prefer you to use I do give it a

400
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:02,720
global symbol which means use the

401
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
internal global distribution for clocks

402
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,390
and I ran it to a counter macro where I

403
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,490
can tell it how many bits I told it ate

404
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,010
in this case and then I ran the output

405
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,039
of that counter to these pins now when I

406
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,409
name the pins I name the pins after the

407
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,069
pin number so IO 11 happens to be pin 11

408
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,789
it's just a habit of mine so then we go

409
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,150
to the assignments we go to the

410
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,610
assignment editor and I was able to give

411
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,720
IO 16 pin 16 so you know when the pin

412
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,150
number starts to work and after you've

413
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,860
compiled at once and this is tricky you

414
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,299
they won't show up til you've compiled

415
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,220
at at least halfway through so once you

416
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,040
do that then you can see the location

417
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,920
assignments on here and once that's done

418
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,610
we click program I'm sorry we click

419
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,020
compile shouldn't take long on today's

420
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,530
modern computers and a small old part

421
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:08,440
like this it's done I'm about to pick

422
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,210
the file to program and I just realized

423
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,430
something I said earlier was erroneous I

424
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,470
deleted the instance you saw here and

425
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,480
I'm going to click Auto detect and now

426
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,520
it sees the device bus it sees it as

427
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,830
unknown well the the fact is that this

428
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,620
3.3 volt version didn't exist when

429
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,970
Cordes web 29.1 came out so it's an

430
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,880
unknown device so I'm willing to go with

431
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,700
that for now I'm going to go ahead and

432
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,640
add the file and I'm going to tell it to

433
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,490
program and verify it says it worked

434
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,920
let's go see if it did here I picked it

435
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,370
up to my logic analyzer on my scope I

436
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,580
have a built-in trace analyzer and boy

437
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,950
when this be easy if I had made this so

438
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,140
it fitted solderless breadboard instead

439
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,450
of doing what you see here and here's

440
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,910
the trace on my scope using it's a whole

441
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,130
web browser it's built in sure beats

442
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,430
pointing a camera at it and I see enough

443
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,010
going on that yeah and I only wired up

444
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,590
the top a bit so yeah it's it's it's

445
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,230
working boy was that confusing following

446
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,690
the pins the way I had outlined them so

447
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,420
I've got a lot of good ideas for how to

448
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,030
redo this now that I've actually played

449
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,620
with one and sometimes that's the case

450
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,570
you hold one your hand you say what the

451
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,790
heck was I thinking I'm going to stop

452
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,060
there on my little Cpl D module

453
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,110
obviously it needs some work it needs to

454
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,170
be 1/10 inch thinner the pin out needs

455
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,270
to be a little cleaner so I don't know

456
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,860
if it's worth putting on github or not

457
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,720
it is still a good educational tool

458
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,670
because you can plug in and program it

459
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,040
and actually plug that thing in anywhere

460
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,680
because it is flash-based before I did

461
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,630
the CPL D I'll tell you that I was going

462
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,000
to do an episode on PLDs the devices

463
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,400
that came first they tended to be in the

464
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,020
dip packages you programmed them

465
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,480
externally we used to use the data IO

466
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,210
and I wrote an entire DRAM controller it

467
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,549
fitted in an 18 20 pin chip except for

468
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:09,460
the Refresh counter and so very

469
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,880
extremely useful however once I bought

470
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,320
lots of PL DS and I bought the

471
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,750
programmers alright a couple programmers

472
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,040
not that I couldn't get anything to work

473
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,679
that was worth while the software was

474
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,990
only Atmel was keeping their software

475
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,370
up-to-date and they only did the app

476
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,380
mail products these programmers don't do

477
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,860
the most popular at mail PL PL d called

478
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,970
the 22 C 1022 v10 it just wasn't worth

479
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,210
it so onto the CP LD however we're on

480
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,290
our way to bigger and better things

481
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,840
anyways but we're going to go through

482
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,120
the CP LD first so this is a module you

483
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,669
