1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,820
they'll heard from hackaday today I'm

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,170
going to show you about six different

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,390
ways to desolder stuff without breaking

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,670
it as I said we're going to be talking

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,320
about desoldering you'll have to forgive

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,849
me I've been staring into the light too

7
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,980
long set in the shop shot up so if you

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,470
see me wander off I am legally blind at

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,539
this point however we've got infrared

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,500
for desoldering big stuff BGA's ball

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,220
grid arrays other surface mount packets

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,410
big I use this particularly if I've got

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,109
a big land under the area that's used as

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,130
a heat sink that that you just can't get

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,960
with hot air at least I can I don't have

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,010
the patience for hot air

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,829
speaking of which we have hot air we're

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,079
going to show you can see there's

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,300
supposed to be a BGA adapter for the hot

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,160
air again if you've got the patience to

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,440
use have better more power to you better

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,870
luck than me and then this thing I love

23
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,000
this thing we used to use an expensive

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
one of these in production now I've got

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,350
one I got for 159 bucks and I'm walking

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,000
around desolder and everything in sight

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,289
so we're going to start with this one

28
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,409
let me show you how to use it alright so

29
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,600
again here's my D soldering gun I just

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,130
got a it's a ZD - 9 85 if you want to

31
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,250
Google for it I got this off of ebay and

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,500
it has a power cord to heat the

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,360
soldering iron part and it's got a

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,580
vacuum hose which pulls a vacuum through

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,320
this tube there's glass tube there and

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,119
there's a filter on the end of it and

37
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,880
what you try and do is heat up all of

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,130
the solder and then hold the trigger you

39
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,049
hear the vacuum and try and get it all

40
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,670
in one shot because as soon as that

41
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,130
chunk of solder goes by then you can't

42
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,930
get what's left because you can't pull a

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,630
vacuum so I'm going to show you how I

44
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,520
use it here I got some camera set up in

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,740
different areas and you're going to see

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,250
me wiggle it once once I start to heat

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,860
it I wiggle it to break the pin was the

48
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,840
component pin and then I'm going to pull

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,909
the solder pull the vacuum and hopefully

50
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,060
I'll get it all in one shot I have you

51
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,770
on the side view here so hopefully

52
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,899
you'll be able to see the where the I

53
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,610
wiggled the tip to break it loose from

54
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,030
the sides

55
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,669
you can hear it squeaking a little bit

56
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,230
solder squeaking and that's good there's

57
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,900
that that pin actually just came all the

58
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,970
way D soldered in one shot so you can

59
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,420
see I can go right down the row

60
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,670
desoldering it's my wiggle and there's a

61
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,570
disordered pin

62
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,599
and just that quick you saw me go down

63
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,190
the row desoldering depends moving on

64
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,780
I'm going to show you how to desolder

65
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,970
surface mount using just some of this

66
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,160
stuff this is a metal that melts at a

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,379
less temperature than solder and allows

68
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,060
you to get all the pins molten all at

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,829
once and lift your part out so let me

70
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,190
demonstrate that all right I'm going to

71
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,950
remove a random surface melt chip here

72
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,680
start with little flux this is the chip

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,980
quick

74
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,170
all right so chips gone that fast the

75
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,340
second step then is to clean up the the

76
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,960
pads that are left behind we want to

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,760
remove all of the chip quick metal and

78
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,260
we also want to make sure everything's

79
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,000
nice and flat for the next chip that's

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,510
going to be put in there now I tend to

81
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,940
scrub in the length of the pad as

82
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,820
opposed to across them as a row it just

83
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,030
just my habit you you may do something

84
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,690
different so and I'm going quick here

85
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,459
for the sake of a video but you can see

86
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,660
that we've got the area cleaned off that

87
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,399
that bridge right there is part of the

88
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,040
printed circuit board so that was quick

89
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,870
you see why this is one of my go-to ways

90
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,460
to get a surface mount part off the

91
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,950
board here I've got a pair of tweezer

92
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,169
soldering irons this is so you can take

93
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,840
out small parts by heating both ends so

94
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,820
that old jumping back and forth with the

95
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,910
soldering iron this goes a lot quicker

96
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,200
will you need to buy one of these

97
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,560
probably not but I just find it's quick

98
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,180
if I do need to go pulling a whole bunch

99
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,600
of parts this fast it's easy it was

100
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,400
cheap again I'm almost everything I'm

101
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,230
showing you here today I got off ebay

102
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,350
from overseas so let me show you the

103
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,360
close-up here and I'll pull some parts

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,630
for you

105
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,199
now the hardest part is this thing is

106
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,979
big okay and so you've got to position

107
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,419
the board to where you can get at the

108
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,669
parts three dy so I can come in a lot

109
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,289
easier on this one hand alright a little

110
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:22,809
bit of flux it's off that quick now I

111
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:26,050
use a I use a pair of tweezers in my

112
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,059
other hand I found that you can either

113
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:33,339
set the part down whoops if you set the

114
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,559
part on something will adhere to it

115
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:39,089
otherwise if it gets stuck to the

116
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,680
soldering iron in a funny place and it

117
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,919
will due to surface tension on you not

118
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,479
get loose with your your other pair of

119
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,990
tweezers and just that quick I cleared

120
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,619
an entire row of little to pin devices

121
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:02,139
and so you just saw me remove about ten

122
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,229
devices in like under a minute so you

123
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,759
can really get cooking with one of these

124
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,399
things again do you need one probably

125
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,360
not are they fun to have yeah so I said

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,269
if you you don't want to be afraid of

127
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:17,769
surface mount you know I like all the

128
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:20,349
tools I can get so let's find a

129
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:24,129
different way to desolder alright here

130
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:25,449
we are at the infrared D soldering

131
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,979
station what you see is there's a

132
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,899
ceramic pre heater underneath it we've

133
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,269
got our circuit board next and then

134
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:33,550
we're going to mask it off with aluminum

135
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,469
foil I also do this when I do hot air

136
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,589
for masking and we're going to let this

137
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:40,119
heat and then at the right time we're

138
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:45,369
going to lift apart alright here we are

139
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,759
I've just threw some flux on it and it

140
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,740
smoked and actually boiled the flux off

141
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,389
which is kind of tell me I'm getting

142
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:54,909
near my temperature and I've added a

143
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,680
temperature probe here in the form of a

144
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,569
fluke the bigger ones these have built

145
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,740
in temperature probes and we'll do a

146
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,019
temperature you know target the

147
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,599
temperature for you but it's not very

148
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,099
hard to sit here and manipulate it

149
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,969
yourself as well

150
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,240
here we are there hasn't been much to

151
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,250
see except that this lights been running

152
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,890
and getting hotter and hotter and

153
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,260
actually I think we're about ready let's

154
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,790
give it a shot that's it there's

155
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,290
actually another stage here and what I'm

156
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,730
going to do is I'm going to go and

157
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,510
flatten out all this all the the the PCB

158
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,610
lands where they were soldered so that

159
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,170
it's nice and flat when we do our next

160
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,110
chip finally we are going to go ahead

161
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,240
and do an actual hot-air desolder

162
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,510
ization if that's a word and so we've

163
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,060
got the ebay special desoldering a

164
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,510
hot-air rework station and I've grabbed

165
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,550
a microphone stand I've made a holder

166
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,790
for the hot-air station here and so

167
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,160
hopefully that'll overcome my impatience

168
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,770
with it so I didn't preheat this one I

169
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,050
just wanted to see how well my mic stand

170
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,090
worked actually so alright I've got a

171
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,830
hot-air station I've just got it propped

172
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,630
up on a roll of solder so it kind of

173
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,160
leans forward so you can see it a little

174
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,820
bit and this is the business end of it

175
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,370
and you can control how much air and the

176
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,310
temperature gets noisier as you go so

177
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,800
we're going to turn it back down and it

178
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,410
has different chips of different chips

179
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,410
listenmi different tips for example this

180
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,409
one would fit and that would fit over it

181
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,110
to try and get all the Pens heated at

182
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,010
the same time

183
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,010
here's smaller one for redirecting it to

184
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,740
a smaller maybe you want to do back and

185
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,850
forth or just around a chip we are using

186
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,360
a tip like this that fits the

187
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,520
surface-mount chip I'm on and you'll see

188
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,140
it probably better when I do go to pull

189
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,120
it apart okay it's been a few minutes

190
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,250
I'm going to go ahead and lift the hot

191
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,930
air head and see what's happening

192
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,349
underneath

193
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,260
and that came off pretty much as easily

194
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,230
as the infrared did so obviously the

195
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,180
stand and the tip had worked together to

196
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,240
give me a nice of concentrated heat I

197
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,300
don't know how effective that be on the

198
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,580
bigger BGA so again that's why I have an

199
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,640
infrared one as well so with that said I

200
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,779
hope you learn something about

201
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,060
desoldering or the variation desoldering

202
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,970
but more importantly on you know to not

203
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,860
be afraid of one of these technologies

204
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,100
you know whether it's it's its surface

205
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,279
mount or it's trying to trying to remove

206
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,020
through-hole components in a way where

207
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,089
you can save them reuse the board reuse

208
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:46,190
the component or just have the speed to

209
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,910
make it worthwhile so bill heard on

210
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,990
behalf of hackaday keep hacking
