1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,480
bill heard from hackaday today I'm going

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,130
to talk about analog one last time then

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,510
we're going to do some digital stuff but

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,230
I wanted to talk about thermocouple

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,260
amplifiers thermocouples to dissimilar

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,670
metals touching each other we know this

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,010
right last time we were talking about

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,720
instrumentation amps and I mentioned

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,550
strain gauges and you won't have a lot

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,350
of chance to use that maybe depend on

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,939
what business you're in what your

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,199
hobbies are in you probably won't be

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,000
hooking a tuned Arduino anytime soon

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,439
measure the strain of a bridge or

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,309
something or scale you can make a scope

16
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:36,750
so what I did is I made a little circuit

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,180
board to show the thermocouple effect

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,160
I'm going to show you the schematic that

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,559
I pulled it from and then let's talk

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,210
about the theory of operation so after

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,180
the last day uh the last video on

22
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,710
instrumentation amplifiers I had thought

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,770
to do a video on the zero drift

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,480
technology the chopper stabilized

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,039
reference stabilized whatever you want

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,710
to call it and I think I'm going to hold

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,059
off a little bit I'm actually going to

28
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,190
get some information from the vendors

29
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,470
themselves and maybe I can approach that

30
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,260
and speak to it more intelligently so

31
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,820
but one of the things I came across

32
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,049
while looking at zero drift amplifiers

33
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,659
zero drift for temperature that is is

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,430
this so I'm looking at one of linear

35
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,770
technologies operational amplifiers at

36
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,860
zero drift and they had a nice little

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,299
circuit on the bottom here for a

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,930
thermocouple amplifier two parts so here

39
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,329
is a blow-up of that little circuit

40
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,880
diagram off of the datasheet and we've

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,009
got a you know our zero drift

42
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,470
instrumentation amplifier in zero drift

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,509
a lot of times means aroldo for

44
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,340
temperature effects and that's good if

45
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,720
we're trying to measure temperature so

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,250
that makes sense that they would put

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,930
this kind of circuit on that datasheet

48
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,500
and we see a type K thermocouple which

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,270
is a lot of times this real common one

50
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,439
you see we'll talk about these a little

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,189
bit more and then there is a cold

52
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,610
Junction compensator the LT 1025 here

53
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,549
and so if we look at the circuit I made

54
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,770
there's two chips and here's our

55
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,199
amplifier here's this cold temperature a

56
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,890
cold Junction compensator let me talk

57
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,100
but that's more now a problem with just

58
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,410
hooking up something like this to an

59
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,050
amplifier would still be one of

60
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,900
calibration and if you were to take

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,060
something like this and stick it in ice

62
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,270
water and then zero out your scale then

63
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,190
you you would have a you would know the

64
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,140
change of temperature from zero degrees

65
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,470
well the thermocouple cold Junction

66
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,720
amplifier thing we're talking about what

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,760
that does is do that it does that

68
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,900
calibration for us and it first gives us

69
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,290
an output based on the type of

70
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,250
thermocouple we're using we're using

71
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,739
type K which is real common again two

72
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,130
and a half dollars which changes its

73
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,680
voltage forty point six micro volts per

74
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,600
degree C there's a slight range in there

75
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,610
but that's what they're showing there's

76
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,120
also some non-linearity a kind of a kind

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,040
of probably a SAG in the voltage so they

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,870
make up for it and what this really is

79
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,030
is a second thermometer here's one

80
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,310
thermometer the the thermocouple itself

81
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,019
and then here's a reference thermometer

82
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,900
think of it that way when it's pre

83
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,140
shaping I wanna say pre emphasizing like

84
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,110
audio but when we're pre shaping the

85
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,690
voltage based on the room temperature or

86
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,480
what they call the cold temperature and

87
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,940
then we measure the voltage of the hot

88
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,829
temperature or what or what the probe

89
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,410
itself is saying then we subtract those

90
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,239
two and that gives us the temperature of

91
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,610
this above our cold temperature you

92
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,519
might ask why not just use this chip if

93
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,799
it's a thermometer and you could but but

94
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,590
this thing can stand a lot more hostile

95
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,799
environment than then the chip itself so

96
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,530
of one of the reasons also you know can

97
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,650
sit on the end of a long cord so the

98
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,930
output of this in addition to knowing

99
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,420
where 0 volts is right or 0 I'm sorry a

100
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,269
reference temperature is in general so

101
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,769
the output makes sense to us on a

102
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,500
voltmeter for example it also scales it

103
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,180
before the different thermocouples we're

104
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,510
using type K very cheap very common 40

105
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,519
micro volts per degree C so for every

106
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,620
degree C the thermocouple C's

107
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,000
the voltage will change as much

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,950
different thermocouples different

109
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,130
amounts and then this actually has a

110
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,570
reference output of 10

111
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,810
volts per degree C so you could just

112
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,750
create your own circuit based on a nice

113
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,810
easy to use decimal number so while I

114
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,630
was looking at the cold Junction

115
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,390
compensator I came across this right

116
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:47,690
here and this is a matched it's a kid of

117
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,310
a matched Junction compensator in a

118
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,830
matched amplifier and then they even

119
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,360
give us the ability to do some trimming

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,740
and stuff because hey now we're in

121
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,620
accuracy but this is essentially the

122
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,840
chipset I used to do this little design

123
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,510
I'm going to show you here so is here's

124
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,130
the little circuit board as built and

125
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,900
what I did was I brought out the

126
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,880
different taps for the different kind of

127
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,550
thermal couples so we are a K type as I

128
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,620
mentioned earlier that's a very common

129
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,320
type very cheap but if you remember on

130
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,870
the datasheet we had these taps for

131
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,790
these different ones and so I just went

132
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,020
ahead and brought them out also I

133
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,700
brought out a ground and some other

134
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,070
things and this is telling us that it's

135
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,890
18 degrees C here in the lab which is

136
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,040
about 65 degrees and that's close it's

137
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,410
it's off by a few degrees mostly because

138
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,820
I didn't have the exact to 1% resistor

139
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,770
in stock and I wasn't going to build an

140
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,770
adjuster into this for just this little

141
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,270
demonstration here today so nice so you

142
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,520
could take this and now feed this into

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,170
the ad converter on your favorite

144
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,120
microcontroller and you've got yourself

145
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,080
a thermocouple amplifier that will read

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,950
out in millivolts per degree C now I'm

147
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,090
going to show you a trick from the old

148
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,720
days um that's still still valuable if

149
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,670
you need to use it which is that a

150
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,410
regular ole silicon diode one-in-nine

151
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,660
1/4 diode has a temperature coefficient

152
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,440
of 4 millivolts per degree C so if you

153
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,050
figure that you had an amplifier up here

154
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,690
and you you needed 8 millivolts per

155
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,760
degree C or 2 millivolts you would

156
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,530
calculate the resistor that gets fed

157
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,430
into it and create your own and polarity

158
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,840
you would you would change the polarity

159
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,240
on on which way this is going to create

160
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,000
your your own temperature coefficient

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,280
based voltage that

162
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,780
but correct for the temperature of the

163
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,190
circuit we used to do this in our

164
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,220
digital scales in the last video I did

165
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,170
stick the scope probe on the output of

166
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,080
the instrumentation am running more gain

167
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,270
than was here but you you know with that

168
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,310
said there was no filtering either so

169
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,580
you did see a lot of you know some some

170
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,020
of the noise getting in that you would

171
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,350
expect and again laying on the bench so

172
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,810
here we did have two poles of filtering

173
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,690
going on and you don't see the high

174
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,820
frequency artifacts that we saw before

175
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,370
but you do see some low frequency stuff

176
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,260
you see the 60 Hertz that's all around

177
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,110
us and in this case the thermocouple

178
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,330
itself is unshielded it's a pair of

179
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,510
wires couple feet you know long twisted

180
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,850
at the ends laying on the workbench so

181
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,220
and actually if I were to touch the very

182
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,530
tip of the probe you'd see the 60 Hertz

183
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,450
jump up much like you do when you touch

184
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,700
a scope rope so if we had to we could

185
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,770
shield it and we could go in with a 2

186
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,050
Hertz pole filter I mean I'm sorry a 2

187
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,690
Hertz filter and we could go after this

188
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,240
if we really wanted to so this video was

189
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,919
a bit of a quickie but I did want to

190
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,690
show you a quick use of an

191
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,460
instrumentation amplifier and make you

192
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,320
aware the cold Junction compensator and

193
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,600
the fact that you needed a cold Junction

194
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,630
compensate it but again it I think it

195
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,669
was just a nice little add-on use and it

196
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,979
actually showed a time when I have any

197
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,419
amplifier that didn't respond to

198
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,580
temperature was useful when measuring

199
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,160
temperatures so I might read this board

200
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,650
throw it up on tindy or late believe it

201
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,300
it's open source through OSH park or

202
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,760
something like that a cute little way to

203
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,010
take a pair of dissimilar metals and be

204
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,080
able to measure it with an Arduino so

205
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,310
Bill heard from hackaday

206
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,110
will catch on the next video I'm hoping

207
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,450
to get back into some CPLDs PLDs I'm at

208
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,669
PGA's actually I've got a couple PLD

209
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,050
projects and maybe we'll talk about

210
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,729
switching hazards or something cool

211
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:31,100
there so they'll hurt from hackaday

212
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,030
have a good one
