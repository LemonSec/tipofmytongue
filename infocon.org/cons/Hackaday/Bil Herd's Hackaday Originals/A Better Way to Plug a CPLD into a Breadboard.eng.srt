1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,609
bill heard from hackaday today we're

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,259
going to finish up the little CP LD

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,000
board we started if you remember it was

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,240
too wide to fit on a fricken solderless

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,700
breadboard so we fixed that and we ended

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,350
up with some actually kind of cute

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,980
just to recap this is Rev 2 of a CP LD

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,320
module I started with a a complex

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,859
programmable logic device and it was

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,390
something that you could build yourself

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,369
I meant this as a DIY kit I've actually

12
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,140
been having some fun and you know

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,239
possibly even replace an obsolete chip

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,040
someday that kind of thing

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,960
so it's almost all through-hole so you

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,260
can stuff it yourself and we try and

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,210
improve on the last design and and so

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,680
some of the things we improved on one

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,570
the last one was too wide to fit in

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,370
solderless breadboard mostly I don't use

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,750
solderless breadboards didn't know how

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,390
wide they were second was it didn't have

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,000
any dedicated power connections and so I

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,739
was clipping to the bottom to the pins

25
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,930
that actually would fit into a your PC

26
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,579
board or whatnot or into your breadboard

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,620
and the clips kept coming off so it's

28
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,449
got a dedicated power connector and

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,939
there's an external clock capability via

30
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,340
jumper and that was somebody suggested

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,780
that from the comments it was a great

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,760
great suggestion so I can just bring in

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,130
an external clock and the other stuff

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,630
was cleaning up the schematic so is

35
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,400
easier to troubleshoot let me show you

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,310
this side-by-side with the old one and

37
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,850
show you what it's capable of here

38
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,030
here's the original CPL d module the Rev

39
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,880
one and as I said it was too wide to fit

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,520
in a solderless breadboard say you only

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,500
get one row and I thought there were

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,390
very sizes these turns out these are all

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,490
the same width even on the big ones

44
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,520
where they they have row after row

45
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,729
doesn't fit here's the second one and

46
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,060
you can see it's been put on a kind of a

47
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,729
diet here most notably from the bottom

48
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,040
you can see it's now 0.6 which is pretty

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,079
standard one inch of it was not standard

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,170
and it like I said it actually looks

51
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,119
kind of cute let me show you a close-up

52
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,140
of this here's the rebbe to kind of

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,149
close up you'll see that it is indeed

54
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,200
much skinnier 0.6 inch centers and

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,050
yeah kind of kind of fits in there nice

56
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,540
and tight though I did use through-hole

57
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,010
for everything the oscillator here is a

58
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,330
surface mount just mostly because

59
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,290
otherwise it'd be huge

60
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,880
I used a USB micro I'm sorry USB mini

61
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,209
power plug so this is a 5 volt version

62
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,670
and and I probably if I'm gonna rev this

63
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,410
for my own purposes and I'm going to put

64
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,180
a different plug on there so I can use 3

65
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,930
and 5 volts

66
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,730
I was thinking strictly of the 5 volt

67
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,010
version so and with the oscillator I can

68
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,580
pin pin I can jumper select whether I

69
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,620
want internal oscillator or an external

70
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,590
oscillator via this plug and on the rev

71
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,150
3 I've kind of working on from my own I

72
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,890
just turned that into one plug there was

73
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,840
no reason to have to and then there was

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,569
an external power plug for 2 wires here

75
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,000
and the one thing I would do different

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,299
is whenever there's an a non polarized

77
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:06,190
plug for power I like to put a

78
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,080
protection diode in there so if you get

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,400
it backwards you don't ruin everything

80
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,470
and that's going into my own personal

81
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,810
rev 3 is is that little protection diode

82
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,690
and in fact for power I'm not use one

83
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,040
this little thing where I can bring it

84
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,560
five older three volt but this is kind

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,359
of a custom cable I had made so that's

86
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:25,769
why this ended up with a USB micro on it

87
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,609
now the parts availability on this I'm

88
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:31,840
going to show you a couple of the parts

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,200
but this part here the the this is the 5

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
volt EPM 70-64 the bigger of the two

91
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,049
that fit this this fits a 32 backer cell

92
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,109
or a 64 macro cell this is like eight or

93
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,000
nine dollars on digi-key and almost

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,090
every catalog place I'm some overseas

95
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,040
for about 3 bucks so I would ordered a

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,390
bunch of them so if somebody's really

97
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,400
wants to follow through with this get in

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
touch with me and maybe I can pass some

99
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,079
of those on and there's also another

100
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,700
part that's just not worth paying for

101
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,370
these are the pins that go here and I'm

102
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,140
going to actually show you how how this

103
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,650
works

104
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,870
where this can overlap that because you

105
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,150
actually see that it does this strip

106
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,090
will cost you two bucks this is a 40 pin

107
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,100
so you break it in half to get your 40

108
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,370
pin 2 20s I got a bunch of these off

109
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,010
Amazon of all places for cheap so again

110
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,900
if somebody's following through I'm

111
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,400
gonna try and get these up with some

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,940
affordable

113
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,270
parts mace mainly but you trade for is

114
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,860
just buying a little bit of bulk I've

115
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,470
spent ten bucks for a pile of these in

116
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,540
the delivery time from overseas for the

117
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,520
part like this now the reason this

118
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,320
didn't start starts getting to begin

119
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,810
with because on the old one you see that

120
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,290
the PLD fits entirely inside these rows

121
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,960
of the bottom connectors is here they

122
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,900
actually overlap okay and so I just tack

123
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,020
soldered these in but you can see it

124
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,580
runs right down the middle of the row

125
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,450
and so after you solder them see I've

126
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,550
clipped them after after you solder

127
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,230
these in then you got to clip them down

128
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,250
low so that a socket can fit in on top

129
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,980
now reason I don't see actually fits

130
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,170
woops see actually fits now I just

131
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,610
didn't think to do that originally

132
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,320
because I used to design for production

133
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,940
and this is all what we call handwork

134
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,590
post solder assembly work just

135
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,350
cringeworthy work never be able to

136
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,150
produce this mass quantities but hey

137
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,340
it's just us having some fun right so

138
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,380
that's kind of the trick where we were

139
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,690
able to and it worked also for the in

140
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,360
circuit program or plug ran it right

141
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,370
down the middle it's just there's parts

142
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,600
on both sides of the board inter

143
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,740
soldered but you know what there was

144
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,560
parts on both sides of the board anyways

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
Before we jump into the project level

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,620
and again my goal was to give you a

147
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,330
project that you can actually just open

148
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,250
up and start right in all the pieces are

149
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,140
there including the timing simulation

150
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,800
etc I wanted to show what a CPL D or a

151
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,680
PLD actually what's on the inside and

152
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,080
you'll see it's a programmable logic

153
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,030
device well the programmable part it's

154
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,710
all over the place but the main part of

155
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,050
are these macro cells or they call them

156
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,210
LEDs in the Altair parlance it means

157
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,200
logic array block and there's a repeat

158
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,580
repeated chunk of logic and we'll see

159
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,100
that logic here in a second in in the

160
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,580
case of a 70 64 there 64 of them then

161
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,919
we've got programmable IO control so the

162
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,570
pins can be programmed as inputs outputs

163
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,910
the slew control that kind of thing and

164
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,890
we've got some global signals like

165
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,140
global clocks which go to everything

166
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,530
very low skew between all the blocks you

167
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,060
don't ripple it from one block to

168
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,340
another it's it's a mesh of global

169
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,260
clocks a couple to choose from

170
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,330
output enables and then a global clear

171
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,900
so inside the LEDs it's it's got the

172
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,940
ability to pick off all kinds of

173
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,410
different signals actually this is on

174
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,690
the edge of the LAV and then it just

175
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,880
goes into a product term and you don't

176
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,830
hook up in gates and whatnot you create

177
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,040
a formula that blows these bits in here

178
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,510
so it says well give me three of those

179
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,250
two of those one of those invert that

180
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,490
one feed it back and so this is really

181
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,410
what's going on is just it's it's a

182
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,930
matrix array of logic that's and so it

183
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,880
does all the logic in one step instead

184
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,650
of rippling through am gates and or

185
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,740
gates this on the right-hand side is how

186
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,320
we program the i/o again this gets

187
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,700
really handy in FPGAs where you can do

188
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,910
LVDT and and high-speed different you

189
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,630
know 2.5 tt your 2.5 volt sima you know

190
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,080
you program all that in here so this is

191
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,750
what's in a CPL D is basically an array

192
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,200
of these things that are programmable

193
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,200
over and over again here's the hackaday

194
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,230
dot IO project page for this that I'm

195
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,330
setting up and there will be all the

196
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,640
files and links here for you to either

197
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,800
edit the schematic yourself if you use

198
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,560
Proteus like I do or their Gerber files

199
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,060
will be there including I'll make sure

200
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,090
that there is a zipped file set up for

201
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,970
OSH Park if you use OSH park it's got

202
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,560
all the naming conventions already

203
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,870
corrected in it and everything I myself

204
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,630
just started using a company called PCB

205
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,150
way and I got like 50 of these boards

206
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,460
made for like 22 dollars or something

207
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,180
like that and delivered in a week so I'm

208
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,680
kind of happy about that right now I'm

209
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,150
starting to design all kinds of things

210
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,510
so but in here we'll be like I said the

211
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,640
Gerber's and and some of the things but

212
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,090
the main thing will be the altaira

213
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,940
project file and I'll make sure the link

214
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,820
to the version of altera quartus you

215
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,729
need is there so let's go ahead and

216
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,440
assume you've gotten acordes you've

217
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,330
downloaded it and you're ready to open

218
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,370
the project file let me show you what

219
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,470
that looks like

220
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,090
so to get into this you would do a file

221
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,340
open project and the project file that's

222
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,580
from the hackaday io page

223
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,220
and from here we can select hierarchy

224
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,320
files files it's the easiest understand

225
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,060
I think for beginners and in there

226
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,620
you'll see that there's a waveform file

227
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,280
there is a ver log file V and there is a

228
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,710
block diagram file which is a graphic

229
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,510
file and clicking on it gives us this

230
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,900
now this is an overview of the chip here

231
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,180
are the output pins in my case like me

232
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,310
several bunches of counters just look at

233
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,560
all these pins and I've got a simple

234
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,690
clock coming in and I've said that

235
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,130
that's that global clock that goes

236
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,440
everywhere with very minimal school skew

237
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,810
so that when I'm clocking I'm not racing

238
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,980
myself to get to the next block and you

239
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,050
can add graphical blocks like I could

240
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,150
have added a certain kind of counter as

241
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,070
a as a block here and you can do it

242
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,030
right next to blocks that imply a very

243
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,550
log block and and by the way here's the

244
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,710
court is download again I'll make it

245
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,690
I'll make sure this is linked correctly

246
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,750
easy for you to see so if we go in here

247
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,760
it says well what are you trying to get

248
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,490
to and I said well I'd like to get to u1

249
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,070
which is the main CPL D of my design and

250
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,000
I want to get to block one dot v dot ver

251
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,380
log here I've hooked everything up for

252
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,350
you for this

253
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,540
CPL D board that we're talking about so

254
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,520
I've got all the inputs outputs defined

255
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,470
by the way and the way I do it is that

256
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,050
means the pin 26 so when I go later and

257
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,480
I'm hooking io 26 I want to know what

258
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,650
pin to assign it to I sign it to pin 26

259
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,510
then we tell it whether their inputs or

260
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,570
outputs and you can start changing this

261
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,180
if their input output outputs inputs but

262
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,360
it's all here for you and then I made

263
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,330
three things inside this I made a pre

264
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,460
scalar just because because I started

265
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,850
with 25 megahertz when designer was

266
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,550
frequency starved as a kid right so I'm

267
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,140
probably going to redo this you know

268
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,210
I'll probably choose to put a four

269
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,070
megahertz or something on here so I

270
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,500
didn't need a pre scale with 19 bits of

271
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,050
scaler just so you could see it but boy

272
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,150
it's nice to have speed sometimes then I

273
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,310
made a regular counter and then I made a

274
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,050
great counter and yes I'm a spell great

275
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,140
differently than you a great counter by

276
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,410
the

277
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,569
as a counter where only one bit changes

278
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:09,190
at once and they're useful for things

279
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,839
first off we used to do them in the old

280
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,459
days back when we didn't want too many

281
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,920
flips flopping at the same time we

282
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,209
didn't want to dirty up our ground

283
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,850
inside our chips well those days are

284
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,269
gone but it's still an old habit but

285
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:23,949
what it's really useful for is if you

286
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,620
have like an encoder or something that

287
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,480
you could read anytime read it a

288
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,449
synchronously in other words and you

289
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,490
catch it right as you're gone from like

290
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,060
a zero one one one one one one two one

291
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,980
zero zero zero zero and you catch it

292
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,480
right in the middle of that who knows

293
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,269
what you get it 101 1 101 but if you're

294
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,040
only ever flipping one bit at a time so

295
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,279
you're going from 1 101 to 1 1 1 o or

296
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,110
I'm sorry 1 101 to 1 1 1 1 you catch it

297
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,639
right in the middle and you're only ever

298
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,439
off by one bit so it's useful as a

299
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:01,389
synchronous counter so I made a

300
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,279
grayscale counter and I could have done

301
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,949
this with a part that's already built in

302
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:07,509
I'd just happen to do it with definition

303
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:10,959
so here I assign the output pins to the

304
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,910
functions if you're doing your own thing

305
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,310
you would pick the IO pin you want and

306
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,500
you would say this is the output of my

307
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,319
er C generator error error correction

308
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,240
right you could fit an error correction

309
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,910
in here and then here's the little bit

310
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,189
of work in this very log file and always

311
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:29,019
set the positive edge I didn't put the

312
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,029
resets of clears all that you have fun

313
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,089
you know but what I did was I made a pre

314
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,610
scalar actually I combined up blocking

315
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,500
and non blocking here but we'll get over

316
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,740
it

317
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,810
and if you don't know what that means

318
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,009
don't worry about if you do know what it

319
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:45,339
means yes I know I screwed up but here a

320
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,620
counter is nothing more than Q equals Q

321
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,329
plus 1 and we'll find that it

322
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:51,069
implemented actually I'll show you here

323
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:53,769
we're in the hierarchy it said well I'll

324
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,569
put the counter in fray 1 for the scale

325
00:12:55,569 --> 00:13:00,189
and 1 for the Q and I can make this if I

326
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:01,600
want to recompile this lets tell you

327
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,250
it's a counter that's counting down now

328
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,559
it's counting down the great counter

329
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,329
does a thing where it's exclusive

330
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,160
whirring one bit with the bit nearest it

331
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,750
remember it's always flipping one at a

332
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,879
time so it's cognizant of its neighbors

333
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,709
let's put that way you can find the

334
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,660
formulas for this all over the Internet

335
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,309
or you can sit down and work them out

336
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:19,340
yourself or

337
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,260
knock yourself out do something custom

338
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,100
so with that done we just do a file safe

339
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,880
and I'm gonna go straight to compile

340
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,340
here our compile is done and now I

341
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,770
actually want to see this work before I

342
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,230
program it remember I said I gave you

343
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,650
everything so I have a waveform vwf and

344
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,540
in there I define the clock as an input

345
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,840
and then I let you see the output so I

346
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,270
just made groups for them so here's the

347
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,950
counter here's the gray and then I threw

348
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:57,380
in some internal notes you can add nodes

349
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,410
of your own with the node finder and the

350
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,840
main thing here is you you pick what

351
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,910
kind of thing you're looking for

352
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,150
there's pins which is it's not a bad

353
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,680
place to start let's say we just start

354
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,230
but then you got a hit list and and the

355
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,450
asterisk here says list everything so

356
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,610
it's basically it helps you find what

357
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,010
you're looking for and then if we add it

358
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:29,260
to this see it already existed

359
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,470
list and now I've added that to this

360
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,920
waveform so when I go to simulate this

361
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm going to see the output and now I've

362
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,209
also want to see specifically this to

363
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,120
create the clock I told I right-click on

364
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,670
the the clock waveform I go to value I

365
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,589
can do counter stuff like that but what

366
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,310
I do is a clock and I tell it the the

367
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,560
cycle time of the clock and it drew this

368
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,790
for me so for example if I want to make

369
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,410
it twice as slow there we go so now I'm

370
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,199
going to do a simulation I'll do a file

371
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,300
save if I don't it'll ask me I kind of

372
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,649
do that that way I know I click the

373
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:25,310
right button when I start my simulation

374
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,540
yes I want to change it because I

375
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,000
changed and it's doing another kind of

376
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,709
it's basically doing a compile of

377
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,300
anything it's missing to get you the

378
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,660
information and again this isn't a test

379
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,790
bench which later you can use to see if

380
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,379
when you make a change if it breaks

381
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,990
something test bench is very useful for

382
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,189
that and so now it's opened a second

383
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:49,079
waveform here's our first one where

384
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,180
everything is unknown the simulation

385
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,550
report you can throw yourself with this

386
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,189
you'll you'll try writing to it and

387
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,990
changing it well this is an output of a

388
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,329
simulation but here it's filled in you

389
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,180
can see the gray six that we asked for

390
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,259
let's see if we can zoom out this is

391
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,709
basically the operation of it so I here

392
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,629
you see that the timing has now been

393
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,819
included and this is the older timing

394
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:16,829
they stopped using it after nine - and

395
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,350
they started using modelsim which is

396
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,149
more powerful but it's got its own

397
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,759
little quirks this one was nice and easy

398
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,680
built in a matter of fact I changed this

399
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,449
so it has a black background and lots of

400
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:30,480
cool colors when I'll use this okay so

401
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,500
the final thing we'll want to do is to

402
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,509
program the device on the bench member

403
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,100
actually changed the counter to a down

404
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,949
counter so that looks like a little

405
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:42,660
ribbon cable here so I'm guessing that's

406
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,120
the programmer and here's the last time

407
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,069
I programmed it already set here's what

408
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:49,430
I do you get these habits

409
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,950
paranoia I go ahead and do an auto

410
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,950
detect to make sure it sees my part out

411
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,390
there I've even thought I was

412
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,130
programming a part and it's not out

413
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,930
there and it doesn't know a way to tell

414
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,300
me all right so here it told me it's out

415
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,599
there don't go ahead and delete it and I

416
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,079
go ahead and I add a file and in theory

417
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,510
it's talking to the same part I'm gonna

418
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,209
do a program and a verify when it's done

419
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,329
programming it's highlighted so I click

420
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,500
start we watch it we hope it doesn't go

421
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,230
bad and it says it did it and it didn't

422
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,030
flag in the air so let's go see if it's

423
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,090
counting down now well it's counting

424
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,860
down now I know it's hard to see at home

425
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,170
it's just a bunch of blinking lights in'

426
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,690
but that's all it started out to be

427
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,770
actually so it was that quick to you

428
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,410
know change the sign recompile didn't

429
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,260
even need to simulate and download so

430
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,750
that's it for this time it's hopefully

431
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,309
that gives you a starting point if you

432
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,440
were interested in CPLDs or the

433
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,450
educational part of playing with one or

434
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,850
maybe replacing a function that's hard

435
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,590
to get do they still make sixty-five

436
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,860
fifty-one yards I don't know I actually

437
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,440
have my fpga board done whether it works

438
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,059
or not it's a different manner but i got

439
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,040
this board cost down to less than a box

440
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm pretty happy with that and we'll see

441
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,170
what we can play with next time so bill
