1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,190
bill heard from hackaday today we're

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,480
going to be talking a little bit more

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,160
about analog to digital converters

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,769
specifically Delta Sigma or Sigma Delta

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,049
whichever one you want to call it but

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,250
we're also going to be talking about

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,929
effective number of bits signal-to-noise

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,720
ratios over sampling digital filters

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,970
there's a lot of stuff on the bench to

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,410
show you and there's a lot of things to

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,029
talk about so let's get going in the

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,550
last video we talked about 3a to D

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,500
converters analog to digital converters

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,689
we talked about the dual slope which is

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,790
has a lot of bits but fairly slow

16
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,700
updates we talked about the success

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,800
successive approximation register the

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,260
SAR and I actually modeled that and

19
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,149
showed it as a spreadsheet and then we

20
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,649
talked about the flash which are the

21
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,110
fastest ones but ultimately limited in

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,000
the number of bits today we're talking

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,890
about the Sigma Delta sometimes you'll

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,960
hear it called Delta Sigma it's up to

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,170
you I call it Sigma Delta half the time

26
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,449
the Sigma Delta mixes several

27
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,820
technologies as we'll see it's it's kind

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,590
of a hybrid that came after these three

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,430
other types of converters and so it's

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,320
got the best of a lot of things and it's

31
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,640
kind of an interesting thing we're

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,950
actually going to talk about how the

33
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,140
noise a signal noise ratio determines

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,850
our number of bits we're going to talk

35
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,119
about how over sampling can extend that

36
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,030
signal to noise ratio and then we're

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,500
going to talk about digital filtering at

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,090
least a little bit here's a block

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,950
diagram of the Sigma Delta A to D

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,600
converter we'll be talking about today

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,150
it starts with the delta-sigma modulator

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,329
which takes for example a sine wave here

43
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,970
as an input and it produces an output

44
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,460
that is digital nature very

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,229
counterintuitive for it it's sort of

46
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,600
given that it's just one bit you see

47
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,189
it's just ons and offs that what happens

48
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,770
here is that the ratio of highs and lows

49
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,560
it relates back to the signal and I'll

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,270
show you the insides of this here in a

51
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,799
second

52
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,630
taking this digital signal we go ahead

53
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,880
and we use a digital filter on it so

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
this is fairly new stuff in the great

55
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,960
scheme of things but we can do this now

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,850
and this is built into tiny chips you

57
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,439
can go on a digit key and see an

58
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,960
Adafruit sigma-delta ma a to D converter

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,538
for a few bucks and it has a nice grade

60
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,489
C output and the things about the size

61
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,290
of your thumbnail right so all this is

62
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,770
built in

63
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,300
to it but we're going to make our own

64
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,040
digital filter here before the other day

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,820
so we we accumulate we average we we

66
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,220
take all these bits and turn it into a

67
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,920
pile of information which at the end of

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,990
the day we can reconstruct our sign way

69
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,090
from but we also have too much

70
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,710
information for it to be useful we're

71
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,270
going to throw away most of it because

72
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,150
according to the Nyquist criteria I only

73
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,640
need a frequency twice as high as the

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,530
highest frequency I'm looking at so if

75
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,110
this thing's 1 kilohertz anything here

76
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,440
past 2 kilohertz is a waste I would

77
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,780
decimate this down to the number of

78
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,460
samples I need here's the inside of a

79
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,070
delta-sigma modulator and I have built a

80
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,980
couple for us to take a look at today

81
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,270
and they work to various degrees well

82
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,420
we'll go into it the the input is a

83
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,370
difference amplifier in other words an

84
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,410
op-amp that's got an inverting input and

85
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,060
a non-inverting input and the difference

86
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,510
between those two appears on the output

87
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,980
then we have an integrator well if you

88
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,600
remember me talking about dual slope

89
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,310
integrators integrators make nice

90
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,320
low-pass filters they're forgiving they

91
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
accumulate your little squiggles and

92
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,400
turn them into something smoother so

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,610
it's an averaging over time it's way to

94
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,160
look at it and then finally we have a

95
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,990
comparator and well if you remember a

96
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,740
flash comparator flash I'm sorry a 2 D

97
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,370
converter

98
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,340
we'd have 256 comparators for eight bits

99
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,440
well we've got a one bit comparator and

100
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,480
it's like well how the heck does that

101
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,180
work and we're going to find out most

102
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,640
importantly though or as importantly we

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,550
have a feedback path where the output of

104
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,220
this then flips the polarity of the

105
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,990
signals being summed in with the

106
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,930
amplifier or with the signal so that

107
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,870
this thing tries to ride along the input

108
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,030
signal if it's too high this thing will

109
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,380
make start going low if it's too low

110
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,180
this thing of go high and it's this

111
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,670
modulating output that's of interest to

112
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,490
us so we're going to stop there we're

113
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,660
going to look at some theory and then

114
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,880
I'm going to show you the signal alright

115
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,450
let's talk about quantization which is

116
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,488
the act of mapping an analog value to a

117
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,779
digital value and I showed some diagrams

118
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,030
real quickly last time and mention some

119
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,080
things and there was some disagreement

120
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,389
and that's pretty normal

121
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,639
because there's different ways to model

122
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,370
things and I prefer to be open all the

123
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,539
models all at the same time

124
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,479
simultaneously here in the purple is a

125
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,210
signal that we want to quantize we want

126
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,860
to bring it through the analog to

127
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,129
digital converter into a digital values

128
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:46,469
these lines here the horizontal lines

129
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:51,090
here here are the steps of the A to D

130
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,250
converter this is your resolution you

131
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,379
can either record it as this value or

132
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,310
this value these vertical lines is the

133
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,590
sample rate this is when I took the time

134
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,620
to see which of the resolution bits

135
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,509
where we closest to so as the signal you

136
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,610
know at this time boom it's right on the

137
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,319
money and we've got a good

138
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,690
representation of what the voltage was

139
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,779
at that time on the next sample time

140
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:21,000
we're about a half a bit off you'll

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,009
never get more than half a bit because

142
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,629
then I would have put the blue dot here

143
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,569
but in this case I determined that this

144
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,389
was the the right value at this time and

145
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,550
so on the next one you'll see I'm pretty

146
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,639
close here but I'm a half a bit off here

147
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,610
I'm on the money here well in the

148
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,860
process of quantizing we get

149
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,409
quantization error and that is basically

150
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,529
this amount of difference between this

151
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,900
point in time and that voltage amplitude

152
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,520
and the point at the point we recorded

153
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,669
now just you can think of it as just

154
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:59,370
slightly instantaneous differences go

155
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,789
ahead and do that or we could just draw

156
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,940
a line on it in this case I've just

157
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,250
connected the dots together to show you

158
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,310
that there's energy here however you

159
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,080
want to model you can model it as what

160
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,580
would be the equivalent sine wave that

161
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,789
would show this difference it could be

162
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:20,639
an equivalent ramp wave triangle wave

163
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,620
and and there's different math for those

164
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,020
I'm just trying to show you that there's

165
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,039
a difference here and if we go to more

166
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,969
samples or I'm sorry more resolution we

167
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:34,860
get closer remember we were a half a bit

168
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,690
off well now we've got twice the number

169
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,259
of bits here and we've got less error we

170
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,110
are on the money

171
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,210
here on the money here we're closer here

172
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,940
we're closer here in this case I didn't

173
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,920
mean for it to all be on the on the the

174
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
intersections like that but that's the

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,110
way it turned out

176
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,600
at the end of the day the signal this

177
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,750
this noise contributes it's called

178
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,790
quantization noise contributes to the

179
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,320
signal-to-noise ratio there's other

180
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,300
noises there's other nonlinearities

181
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,460
other sources of errors right now I'm

182
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,800
talking about what's usually one of the

183
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,150
main ones is the quantization error and

184
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,830
quite simply the quantization error if

185
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,750
you do the math involved the

186
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,910
signal-to-noise ratio that we end up

187
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,810
with is 6.02 times the number of bits of

188
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,060
our converter so if it's a ten bit

189
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,800
converter it's 60 0.2 decibels

190
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
plus 1.7 SEC the greater number of bits

191
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,050
I have the greater my signal-to-noise

192
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,810
ratio of meat will be which means the

193
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,850
the difference between the good part in

194
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,460
the bad part and I can look at it the

195
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,720
other way if I measure my

196
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,970
signal-to-noise ratio that gives me the

197
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,040
effective number of bits of my A to D

198
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,830
converter give you a clue it's always

199
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,600
less than what you bought if you bought

200
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,310
a 12 bit converter you might be getting

201
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,650
10.5 bits out of it by the time things

202
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,260
add up but one of the way just to

203
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,970
calculate that effective number of bits

204
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,160
that you actually end up with comes

205
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,620
right back to this equation I put a

206
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,100
signal generator with a 10 kilohertz or

207
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,770
so sine wave to my spectrum analyzer and

208
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,110
this is my spectrum analyzer here down

209
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,270
here is a low frequency up here is a

210
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,800
high frequency this is the frequency

211
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,530
domain as opposed to the time domain and

212
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,380
here's the frequency from my signal

213
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,330
generator and if I increase and decrease

214
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,940
that frequency you'll see it it moves

215
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,160
left to right now this isn't to be

216
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,990
confused with the time domain here and

217
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,270
you can see as I increase and decrease

218
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,640
the frequency that's that's doing the

219
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,229
time domain but up on the top the

220
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,960
frequency domain is is resulting in the

221
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
signal moving again horizontally left to

222
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,370
right so had where there are several

223
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,110
sine waves here there'd be several blips

224
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,200
here in fact I can if I make it a square

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,810
wave I see harmonics or triangle waves

226
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,330
this is the frequency content of the

227
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,160
signal here's a graphical representation

228
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,149
of that

229
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,249
frequency-domain we just saw here's my

230
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:00,100
signal this represents the noise down

231
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,910
here this is my signal-to-noise ratio

232
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,680
remember that effective number of bits

233
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,759
is equal to roughly 6 DB of

234
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,829
signal-to-noise ratio so for a 10 bit

235
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:14,829
converter this would be roughly 62 deep

236
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:18,040
decibel between the average noise and

237
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,519
the signal so let's talk about sampling

238
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,220
rate you've heard me say Nyquist we said

239
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,800
it last time the Nyquist criteria is

240
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,519
that to accurately measure a signal we

241
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,829
find that we need the highest frequency

242
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:34,569
when you want to measure let's say this

243
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:37,240
was to 10 kilohertz we would need twice

244
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,970
that in sample frequency to reduce

245
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,160
what's called aliasing errors so here

246
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,629
we've shown the signal we want to

247
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,240
measure that it's been low past or is

248
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,779
just not present anything that gets

249
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,720
between here and here will create errors

250
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,620
and so this is our frequency domain plot

251
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,470
taking account the Nyquist criteria FS

252
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,350
is sample frequency FS divided by 2 is

253
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,199
the usable frequency for a signal as

254
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:08,379
defined by the Nyquist criteria so this

255
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,050
noise its origin being quantization

256
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,970
error as we talked about earlier it

257
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,399
turns out there's a really cool noise

258
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,559
reduction technique called over sampling

259
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,749
which means we increase the sample rate

260
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:23,170
the clock that we use to to sample or

261
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,709
take a measure of the analog signal for

262
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,839
every four times that we increase that

263
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,610
clock let's say we are sampling at 10

264
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,829
kilohertz if we sample it at 40

265
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:35,679
kilohertz the noise the effective number

266
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,499
of bits will go up by 1 in other words

267
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:42,249
the signal-to-noise ratio will improve

268
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:46,059
by approximately 6 dB so if I increase

269
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,069
the heck out of the signal of the

270
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:51,040
sampling rate this amount of noise is

271
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,439
still present it's just it's spread over

272
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,569
a wider area so the energy is still

273
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:57,850
there but now I've spread it all the way

274
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,399
let's say this was 1 kilohertz earlier

275
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,499
and now this is a hundred kil Hertz or

276
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,540
some same amount of noise but look at

277
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,129
the signal-to-noise ratio here is

278
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,920
depicted suddenly down here where

279
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,690
still interested I'm not interested in

280
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,579
all this stuff I did that just to reduce

281
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:15,579
my signal-to-noise but look right here

282
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,160
my signal-to-noise improved because I

283
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,200
oversample finally a one last little

284
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,870
trick we can do here here's the where

285
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,790
we've spread our noise out over a much

286
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,250
wider area now I can also do noise

287
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,440
shaping and why am i showing this well

288
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,410
it's actually in Sigma Delta analog to

289
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,120
digital converters they use all the

290
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,360
tricks right so here we've taken the

291
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,459
noise that's flat across this band and

292
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:42,190
we pushed it so that it's kind of like

293
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,920
tilting a barrel on its side we it's

294
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,990
same amount of energy remember all the

295
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,790
way same back to the beginning but now

296
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,620
the Energy's up not up in the higher

297
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,959
frequencies well if I come along

298
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,750
afterwards and just filter this with the

299
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,230
digital filter so that only here to hear

300
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,180
gets through look at the signal-to-noise

301
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,850
ratio now I've lowered it even further

302
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,709
at the expense of up in the area where

303
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm going to filter and I don't care I

304
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,610
let it go up but this is called noise

305
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,610
shaping so first I over sampled and then

306
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,519
I noise shape and that's where the Sigma

307
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,860
2 Delta analog to digital converter gets

308
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,529
a lot of its meat from it's a lot of its

309
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,470
resolution alright I'm going to stop us

310
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,390
there I've got so much more to show you

311
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,100
it's going to have to wait till part 2

312
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,480
I've got stuff for the bench

313
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,209
I've got where we tie all this theory

314
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,220
we've been talking together too you know

315
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,350
and actually see it in operation but

316
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,089
it's going to have to be a part - so

317
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,490
bill heard from hackaday come back and

318
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,360
see us for part 2
