1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,480
bill heard from hackaday let's do some

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,820
science I'm in the urge to see some

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,790
mitosis what made me think of science

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,580
today is I it seems like we're going

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,740
backwards as far as science and our

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,830
schools and science I see on TV if we're

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,740
actually outlawing gathering information

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,439
and how can we make choices without

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,199
information right so I started asking my

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,000
son about his science curriculum at

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,969
school and you know whereas growing up

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,280
we had a kit where we could model the

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,850
the bonds of molecules and and show the

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,920
relationship between a triple bond the

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,559
stress that put under it

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,960
he had marshmallows and sticks that they

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,120
used in school to simulate that so I

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,190
asked him about a microscope and if he

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,289
had seen mitosis under microscope and

20
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,140
his answer was no so we're going to look

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,989
at my mitosis under a microscope today

22
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,910
now I have to tell you long before I

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,730
went to got to high school I had a

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,589
microscope I got this when I was 8 years

25
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,159
old this was my pride and joy this cost

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,439
the equivalent of one of these did back

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,600
then I'm sure and I ran all over the

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,880
countryside gathering up little vials of

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,650
water to look under it and my finger

30
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,259
hurt from poking it too so I could see

31
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,299
blood under the microscope and this

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,090
thing was just awful right used double-a

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,009
batteries for this little tiny light

34
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,509
bulb and it had a mirror and

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,460
everything's loose but this had a

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,880
magnification of 901 focus so you would

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,710
focus it high and it would drift down

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,799
through it and I didn't care I loved

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,119
this thing so I had got my son

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,570
same a microscope like cost the same as

41
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,640
that did back then and this is what

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,720
we're going to use to look at mitosis

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,659
what is mitosis mitosis is the splitting

44
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,060
of cells right it's probably one of the

45
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,009
most famous one of the most popular

46
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,799
shots you have of seeing the chromosomes

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,420
kind of come together in the coalesce

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,880
and then split apart that I have less

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,090
chromosomes obviously so the place where

50
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,580
we're going to find mitosis happening so

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,230
I had these onions sitting in water in

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,770
these very

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,420
very tip of the roots not the very very

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,820
tip but the tip of the roots is growing

55
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,460
so fast that we should be able to see

56
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,690
the cells splitting

57
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,970
okay so that's what we're going to do

58
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,270
today so what I've done is I've taken an

59
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,770
onion and these have been sitting all

60
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,620
over my house takes me a couple weeks to

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,150
make one of these videos so I had to go

62
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,680
through a couple onions where they sit

63
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,750
and rot in the kitchen but what we're

64
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,130
after are these real tiny new onion

65
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,680
roots that you see there so I suspended

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,660
this in water there were not none of

67
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,900
these onions were fresh roots when I

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,150
started now we have them so what I'm

69
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,060
doing is I'm cutting them and placing

70
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,820
them in a small petri dish and then I'm

71
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,560
going to wash them with hydrochloric

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,440
acid if you think that sounds like how

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,390
you digest something in your stomach you

74
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,640
would be correct I am going to digest

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,670
away the part of the cell walls and

76
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,380
stuff that I want to get out of my way

77
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,750
to see the chromosomes so I've got some

78
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,480
1 molar hydrochloric acid warming up in

79
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,730
a small water bath maybe someday we'll

80
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,709
talk about molarity and whatnot it's a

81
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,650
cool way to talk about elements compared

82
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,690
to their natural weight compared to

83
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,310
other elements so you can do ratios

84
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,760
really easy so one molar warming up and

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm gonna put these tips in there for

86
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,660
about five to ten minutes to predigest

87
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,940
them alright I've had these roots right

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,480
here these root tips that I cut off

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,160
soaking in hydrochloric acid for 10

90
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,080
minutes and then I've rinsed them off in

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,760
a different container this is rinse

92
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,340
water off to the side and if you look at

93
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,110
these you see they've even lost they

94
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,300
look a little mushy er they've been

95
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,700
digested a little bit so now we're going

96
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,320
to hit him with some dye there are

97
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,209
different microscope there different

98
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,150
dyes that they use in microscopy which I

99
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,770
only learn to say in the last year I

100
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,310
thought it was called microscopy and I

101
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,930
don't have the one that you normally

102
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,970
would do with this this is a Citicorp

103
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,370
seen would be normally a very vibrant

104
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,209
purple supposedly but what I do have is

105
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,850
thali Dean blue so I thought I had the

106
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,160
other stuff the or seen I didn't but I

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,108
have blue in stock so I'm gonna use it

108
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,790
it should give me something where I can

109
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,450
get some contrast in it so microscope

110
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,450
DICE they sell these in hobby houses and

111
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,060
there's about a half dozen that i would

112
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,470
tend to use if i were playing around

113
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,350
with this actively and each one does a

114
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,210
slightly different purpose if you've

115
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,820
heard of gram-positive and gram-negative

116
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,890
actually for bacteria one of them is

117
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,570
about how it reacts to one of the dyes

118
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,640
whether it reacts positively or

119
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,750
negatively it's a good way to

120
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,440
demonstrate gram-negative gram-positive

121
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,730
let me see if I can get the glare off of

122
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,640
this for you but you'll see inside this

123
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,050
water now you'll see the blue floaty

124
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,680
things those are our root tips and

125
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,440
they're very blue I might have screwed

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,380
up but I have others and if I screw even

127
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,650
those up so if you can see this little

128
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,950
piece of transparent glass I am holding

129
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,920
that's a slipcover for a slide I'm sure

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,410
you know what slides are well I'm going

131
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,410
to take this and I'm going to crush the

132
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,320
root tip with it in a way is to try and

133
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,080
spread it out on the slide now I

134
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,510
remember breaking a lot of slipcovers

135
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,960
and possibly bleeding doing this but

136
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,150
this is how I remember doing it so we're

137
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,830
gonna try and crush and smear that

138
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,530
enough to see through in and see

139
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,270
individual cells all right

140
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,330
underneath here is a smashed root and

141
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,570
then I've added water to an capillary

142
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,910
action drew the water back in so there's

143
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,560
actually a smashed root under there in

144
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,540
fact it's not a big bright blue glob

145
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,330
means maybe we can see something I'm

146
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,430
sitting at my editing station before I

147
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,560
string together these images we just got

148
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,330
through capturing let me tell you a

149
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,010
little bit first about what you're going

150
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,670
to see and this isn't a video about the

151
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,010
science of mitosis it's a video about

152
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,930
just science and seeing this stuff

153
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,780
yourself right so I recommend that you

154
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,270
you have to pull up Wikipedia on it if

155
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,490
nothing else but what we're looking for

156
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,200
you know and learn more but what we're

157
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,470
looking for here is it normally in a

158
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,930
nucleus you don't see chromosomes right

159
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,010
not normally but then as the the need to

160
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,330
divide comes upon it it'll coalesce

161
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,220
and you'll see something called the

162
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:50,210
prophase and prometaphase afterwards it

163
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,129
means after protection that's after you

164
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,319
get a bee sting or something so for the

165
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,569
prophase the before phase you'll start

166
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,780
to see actual chromosome type shapes in

167
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,759
there and then they'll start to pull

168
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,620
apart and it gets to something called

169
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,020
metaphase actually they'll line up first

170
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,180
that's metaphase and then they'll pull

171
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,159
apart and now there's two cells and this

172
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,900
is the anaphase and then on to some

173
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,780
other two phases I can't see the name

174
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,120
from here so that's what we're looking

175
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,830
for is we're looking for this weird coil

176
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,960
at the coalescence in the beginning and

177
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,750
then we'll do it like this and then

178
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,370
we'll see them line up and then we'll

179
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,050
see him pull apart the first slide and I

180
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,930
see stuff this is so cool to see this

181
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,240
with your own eyes you can see it whoops

182
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,759
that's not what I wanted to do you can

183
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,099
see look at this guy he's getting ready

184
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,500
look at that you can see the tubular

185
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,479
structures in here it's definitely

186
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
something going along on here this might

187
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,919
be a metaphase going let's keep looking

188
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,349
at our slide shall we oh look at this

189
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:54,830
right here I see two nucleuses in there

190
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,409
and again we see things where the

191
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,919
chromosomes are coalescing oh this is

192
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,009
this is cool here's one here's one

193
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,990
pulling apart right there let's

194
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,460
hopefully we'll get a better picture

195
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,219
here in a second and here it is here's

196
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:12,800
one actually pulling apart it's becoming

197
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,520
two cells this this is why we're alive

198
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,039
right that that our molecules have the

199
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,889
ability to do this and there's an

200
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:25,310
anaphase going right afterwards there's

201
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,729
an early early where it's just entering

202
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:31,580
the mitosis stages of replication right

203
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,649
up here leave that though that's still

204
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:40,039
cool see it getting ready and finally

205
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,289
here here we have active replication

206
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,410
going here here this one's getting ready

207
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,230
this one's getting ready here this is so

208
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,649
cool so as you saw it was a lot touchier

209
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,779
trying to get the actual camera to see

210
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,340
what i could see through the

211
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,460
a lot of its intuitive you're adjusting

212
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,710
the focus on the fly because your

213
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,900
subject matter really is

214
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,730
three-dimensional and at these

215
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,260
magnifications you have to focus through

216
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,240
something even into the cell you could

217
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,850
see it focusing deeper and less deep

218
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,980
into the cell but there were some great

219
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,400
shots of the anaphase prophase metaphase

220
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,630
of the various portions of the of the

221
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,610
mitosis and I'll talk about those a

222
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,440
little bit more in the printed part so

223
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,140
bill heard from hackaday they weren't

224
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,910
the greatest shots but you know what

225
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,070
helped kill an afternoon and I got to do

226
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,310
some science catch me on the next one

227
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,750
[Music]

228
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,640
[Applause]

229
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,690
[Music]

230
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,789
[Applause]

231
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,590
[Music]

232
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,649
[Applause]

233
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,430
