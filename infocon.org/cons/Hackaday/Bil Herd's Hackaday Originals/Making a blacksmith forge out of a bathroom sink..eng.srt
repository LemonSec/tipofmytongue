1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,859
they'll heard from hackaday today we're

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,210
going to be doing on something a little

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,370
bit different as I said today we're

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,960
doing something different today I've

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,509
hacked together a blacksmith Forge out

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,920
of a bathroom sink

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,389
mostly because I had a couple laying

8
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,130
around and they're nice and deep in

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,779
their cast so they give me a good fire

10
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,150
bolt the rest is just plumbing and a

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,000
blower and a dimmer switch that I hooked

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,890
to the blower so let me show you what we

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,970
got going here well here's how I made my

14
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,189
small blacksmith's forge out of a

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,790
bathroom sink the bathroom sink itself

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,270
is cast you can see the rust they're

17
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,040
actually pretty heavy construction and I

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,840
got a couple laying around if you're in

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,539
South Jersey you're welcome to on what's

20
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,350
inside here is this was a refractory

21
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,870
cement that I actually got from a sand

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,120
and cement place by the bag and it

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,430
worked okay but it crumbled and what I

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,570
did was I just redid the bowl using

25
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,780
refractory cement I got from Home Depot

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,229
this stuff so and it squeezes right on

27
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,540
it looks wet but it's actually dry in

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,430
the bottom here we've got I can never

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,009
pronounce this it's a chair - it's the

30
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,509
event when I'm going to show you where

31
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,060
the air comes from I had made one myself

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,130
it tended to get clogged so in this case

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,960
I actually splurged and I bought one it

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,479
wasn't very many dollars from centaur

35
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,180
forge online so as with any porch one of

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,210
the main components is that there's an

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,150
air supply and so this is a blower motor

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,450
I built a little matching gasket here

39
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,000
flange and I used regular old plumbing

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,829
to hook it in to the bottom of the sink

41
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,040
here I've got a nut I can remove and and

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,140
let the waste drop out at the bottom so

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,180
a little bit of a waste gate there so I

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,740
didn't mention it but this is called the

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,450
fire bolt now I did have a guy who

46
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,869
actually from eBay I bought a vise the

47
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,479
blacksmith vise from and he looked at

48
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,460
this and he said this was not bad

49
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,128
because the depth if you look there's a

50
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,679
lot of cheap fire bowls you can get or

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,330
the small forges but they're not very

52
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,770
deep the portable ones they

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,710
look almost like barbecue grills so you

54
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,240
do need some depth to get your coal

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,750
going

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,750
this here's blacksmithing coal I just

57
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,000
bought this online I use got my last

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,710
batch from an actual blacksmith in

59
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,740
Delaware this is a little larger than I

60
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,770
had last time but what it is is a low so

61
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,890
far coal and a 50-pound bag with free

62
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,200
shipping it wasn't too bad so I'm now

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,450
getting my blacksmithing coal online

64
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,570
we've got ever-present water and I also

65
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,980
have a fire extinguisher but the water

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,600
is for controlling the fire now you

67
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,550
don't need one of these to get started

68
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,280
but I do have one and this is my

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,350
blacksmith Hannibal you get anvils from

70
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,870
a lot of places but there's something

71
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,890
called an ASO an anvil shaped object and

72
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,440
what that is is an anvil it's a piece of

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,210
metal shaped like an anvil but it is not

74
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,840
hardened steel it is cast steel and most

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,420
of them come from Asia and overseas you

76
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,220
can actually probably get started with

77
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,700
one of those I certainly know I didn't

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,190
have this I would go ahead and use one

79
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,360
all right just to show you the blower

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,660
going here you can probably hear that we

81
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,060
can see the amount of air being forced

82
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,790
into into the bottom of this bowl and

83
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,770
this is just a lamp dimmer I put into a

84
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,110
weatherproof housing what I'm going to

85
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,820
do next is I'm going to fill this here

86
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,170
with coal and I'm going to attempt to

87
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,260
get a fire started not as easy as it

88
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,380
sounds with coal sometimes so hopefully

89
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,090
I'll join you after I got a little bit

90
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,110
of a fire going here

91
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,450
and let's heat some metal make sure that

92
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,480
this thing actually does uh act like

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:58,920
Forge so I moved my porch outside for

94
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,780
the first fire of the season here just

95
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,310
didn't want any expect on expected

96
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,830
surprises plus I am working on a fume

97
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,780
hood for inside the building here

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,480
there's a little bit of yellowish green

99
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,880
or white a screen smoke to starting here

100
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,530
that means two calls finally starting to

101
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,470
catch and it's due to the blower here

102
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,230
providing the oxygen now one thing I

103
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,000
will say that a lot of people do these

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,350
I've heard of them being done in

105
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,780
radar dishes or you know satellite

106
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,480
dishes the old charcoal grills that kind

107
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,570
of thing you can use a hairdryer for the

108
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,080
blower or a shop back in in in exhaust

109
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,880
mode so I just happen to went with a

110
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,340
scroll cage motor and we'll see how it

111
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,560
works I haven't used this one before so

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,480
our fires starting to finally catch here

113
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,390
and let's see if we can start heating

114
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,280
some metal okay we're coming up to

115
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,870
temperature here if I was doing a full

116
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,600
burn today I'd be adding more coal to

117
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,460
this and making a Bank around it which

118
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,280
is called a bank fire and it allows see

119
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,810
how there's smoke coming out of the coal

120
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,310
that's getting warm it's getting ready

121
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,280
to fire and and so you're ready to

122
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
constantly feed in I do have a water can

123
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,390
and a jug of water where you sprinkle

124
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,040
water on the outside edges then to

125
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,470
control how big your fire gets and the

126
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,540
size of it you get to buy products from

127
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,090
this you get coke which is a

128
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,100
concentrated form of carbon which is

129
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,320
very useful with with doing this and you

130
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,120
get clinkers which kind of look like oh

131
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,310
but they're the byproduct the waste and

132
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,830
they make a metallic sound when they hit

133
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,120
stuff which is why they call them

134
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,770
clinkers and you have to you use tools

135
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,050
like these to pull the clinkers out and

136
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,670
out of your way or your fire will slowly

137
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,340
suffocate so coming up into temperature

138
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,410
here and we're going to shove some metal

139
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,190
in in a second

140
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,939
okay so I'm going to twist this piece of

141
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,709
steel because it's up to the temperature

142
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:05,419
where if I can do things like that

143
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,830
now you can use a vise grip I happen to

144
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,920
have a little bar here with slots cut

145
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,340
out of it

146
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,360
and you see I can twist five-eighths

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,499
inch square stock

148
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,410
and II get it over to the anvil and

149
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,010
squared up

150
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,789
so here we have our piece of twisted

151
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:55,729
stock of just shown that we really can't

152
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,680
get this Forge up to temperature here

153
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,479
I'm going to go ahead and put it out I'm

154
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,729
going to take the air out of it and I'm

155
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:09,860
going to cool it off with water now this

156
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,240
here is just a can with some holes

157
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,520
punched in the bottom and it's a

158
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,159
sprinkler can't it's kind of old but you

159
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,139
get the idea it's easy to make the kind

160
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,210
of tools you need for this alright so

161
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,860
you thought you all had a peanut gallery

162
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,870
while you're filming this is what I had

163
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,560
to contend with the only people not in

164
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,770
here today or the peafowl so here's a

165
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,050
here's a little ornamental that's why

166
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,729
I'm wearing a welding glove here's a

167
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,199
nice little ornamental curve as you

168
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,669
could tell it's still hot I'm about to

169
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,639
dunk it in water at that temperature I

170
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,669
can pound that into a you know a point

171
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:48,620
and I played a door knocker or door

172
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,159
handle a Raspberry Pi case just any

173
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,210
number of things

174
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,639
so why do this why show you

175
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,190
blacksmithing well it's a hobby of mine

176
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,380
when I need something to take my mind

177
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,569
off all that other electronic stuff I

178
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,240
like banging and hot metal and unlike

179
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,740
wood if you don't like it you move it

180
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,419
where you need it again if it's too

181
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,099
short you make it longer let's see you

182
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,430
do that with wood and who knows maybe we

183
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,469
can start a trend for Raspberry Pi cases

184
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:17,180
forged out of a high carbon steel or

185
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,900
something so there's there's a lot you

186
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,130
can learn here I'm not going to try and

187
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,509
tell you about the high carbon Steel's

188
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,740
you know I keep I keep Springs from cars

189
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,680
and stuff as a source for those but

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,029
there's just a wealth of stuff online

191
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,979
but my thing is if you think you'd like

192
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,279
to try it you know there's gas forges

193
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,860
there's you know I made one out of a out

194
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,039
of a sink here and you can use start out

195
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,690
with regular hammer and some hard to

196
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,200
bang on and and see if you like it

197
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,570
number of places you can get steel start

198
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,950
with scrap steel don't spend any money

199
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,079
if you can help it so bill heard from

200
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:56,420
hackaday just taking a break from normal

201
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,610
stuff thought I'd uh mangle some metal

202
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,730
and we'll be back on normal stuff next

203
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,649
time so bill heard have a good
