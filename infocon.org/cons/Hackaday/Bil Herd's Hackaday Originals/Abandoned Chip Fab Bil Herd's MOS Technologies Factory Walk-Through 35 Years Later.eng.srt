00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,759
bill heard from hackaday i am going back

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,839
to my roots i am standing in front of

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,120
what was the mos

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,840
technology building i first started here

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,519
working for commodore back in

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,240
oh 83 380 something like 32 years ago

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,080
and this this was it i remember pulling

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,359
up to this and just total

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,600
all right and people have been trying to

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,640
get into this building

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,119
for years now and we just came out i'm

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,720
with doug here we've got a bunch of

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,320
footage from inside

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
it's a mess but it was a lot of fun

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
and there we actually did pull some

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,360
wafers out and some other interesting

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,160
stuff

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,000
so i actually remember where i parked

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,559
the first day right over here i

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,800
parked right where they were we had the

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,600
aerator

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,079
shooting water into the air why because

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,079
there's chemicals in the ground

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,239
that mos had put there and the epa made

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,520
them spray it into the air

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
well it ended up on my car i parked

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,039
under a tree and the leaves were stuck

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,719
to my windshield that's how i know the

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,280
exact spot i parked 32 years ago

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,039
so i'm going to go park there one last

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,799
time before my life ends

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,640
and we'll show you what the inside of

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,479
this place looks like before they either

34
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,840
tear it down or gut it the rest of the

35
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
way

36
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,359
[Music]

37
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,900

so

40
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:52,000
[Music]

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
so this would have been the ground floor

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,079
[Music]

43
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,159
and those are boarded up windows i think

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,600
i think the front door is around here

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
somewhere

46
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,860
oh my god

47
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,280
[Applause]

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
this was the front offices of mos

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
technology

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840

so

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
the outside looking in at the golf

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:51,680

all through here was the chip handling

57
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,640
stuff uh if i remember right

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,480
they would have had the the yellow

59
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
lights because there was the production

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,280
door

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
the or the entrance we used to come in

62
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
and out on a normal basis when you

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:33,840
weren't coming in the front door

64
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,509
[Music]

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,139
[Music]

66
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,839
for sale or lease

67
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,720
this was the offices when i first got

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
here

69
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
for commodore chip guys

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
are the product engineers were in a

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,640
different area

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
but my first office which was actually

73
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,400
benny pruden's office

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080

75
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,759
four of us but he had this great

76
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,479
spider plant collection

77
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,080
due to the fact he had a window

78
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,120
right about here would have been

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,160
shiraz's office

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
this corner here would have been

81
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,000
bob russell ray hughes would have been

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280

83
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,560

90
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,440

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,919

92
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,520
