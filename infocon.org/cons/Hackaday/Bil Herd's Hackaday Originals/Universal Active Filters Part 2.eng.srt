1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,230
bill heard from hackaday we're talking

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,060
about Universal active filters today

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,879
this is actually part two we started

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,809
last last week last month we started on

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,120
the last episode where we showed a

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,520
crossover in a speaker as a typical

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,670
bandpass lowpass highpass you know the

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,450
way to split a signal three ways and

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,220
then we got into talking about a simple

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,800
poll RC filter and then we got into the

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,230
universal active filter called UA f42

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,859
which has a unique attribute well it's

13
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:36,170
cool attribute I like which means that I

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,510
can use a single ganged pot and actually

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,160
sweep all three of those bandpass

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,140
lowpass highpass around with just some

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,059
resistors so normally you're getting

18
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:45,589
involved a little capacitance things

19
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:48,109
like that and then we started testing

20
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:50,179
with a sweet frequency oscillator where

21
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,039
I could show you a whole sweep on the

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,499
screen and off to my left here you see

23
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,929
where I've actually slowed it down and

24
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,789
you can see it starred in the low-pass

25
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,100
go through the bandpass quickly very

26
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,260
small and end up going through the

27
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,280
high-pass so we're going to actually

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,080
throw that on the speakers let you hear

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,570
it then we're going to sweep we're going

30
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,190
to apply the filter to some static

31
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,350
signals more like square wave remember

32
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,010
with the FFT DDS type shows we already

33
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,460
had where I actually claimed that if you

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,230
filter a square wave and get rid of the

35
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,630
even harmonics you will add harmonics

36
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,150
even harmonics cancel if you get rid of

37
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,860
the odd harmonics that you'll end up

38
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,750
with a sine wave let's test that see if

39
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,570
it's true so let's get started okay here

40
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,990
I've got the the sweep oscillator slowed

41
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,810
way down it starts at the low frequency

42
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,060
and goes on up and I did that so that

43
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,890
instead of showing the sweep in one

44
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,560
scope frame you see it over several but

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,360
watch the green where the sine wave is

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,130
very pronounced and abanks its way

47
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,380
through the purple and then kind of ends

48
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,119
up in the blue and then tails on out

49
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,850
this this shows the crossover in effect

50
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,610
so to speak for a known signal so let me

51
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,920
add some music here and let's see what

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,689
that looks like saying you know if it

53
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,159
works you'll see what a crossover does

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,649
in your speakers as you know I can't let

55
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,060
you hear the music that I was listening

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,250
to here this is some very cool Alan

57
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,319
Parsons tales a mystery and imagination

58
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,810
playing here but if you look at the

59
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,519
screen if you look at the green you'll

60
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,060
see the sinew soy del aspect try say

61
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,700
that the sinusoidal aspect of the low

62
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,799
frequency the green the green line and

63
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:27,630
then by the time you get up to the blue

64
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,549
you can see that the signal that gets

65
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,500
through while there's some low frequency

66
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,690
in there the scopes really shown you

67
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,489
there's a lot of high frequency content

68
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,370
so this really is acting is a three ways

69
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,519
a three way filter given that all three

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,150
of these lines look different and if you

71
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,799
were to listen each one you'd hear one

72
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,299
would sound kind of high in tinny and

73
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,590
the every one sounding a little low and

74
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,730
bacey i again can't do it because of the

75
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,170
you know the rules regarding music on

76
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,200
google or youtube if you've seen some of

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,269
the past videos where i've said things

78
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,750
like a square wave is a sum of a lot of

79
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,060
sine waves that was in the direct

80
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,700
digital synthesis or the FFT video where

81
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,069
a sine of square wave is the first third

82
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,720
fifth harmonics and you add them all

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,940
together and it becomes square well

84
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,579
let's test that what happens if I strip

85
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,650
away all the harmonics and we go back

86
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,840
down to just letting the initial

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,700
frequency go through will our square

88
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,470
wave turn into a sine wave in other

89
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,540
words so let's take a look all right

90
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,340
I've got the green that's the low-pass

91
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,030
filter enabled and we're looking at this

92
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,910
happens to be a hundred thirteen hundred

93
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,720
Hertz square wave on the top and as I go

94
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,370
further and further down I'm taking out

95
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,530
more and more of those songs more and

96
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,420
more of those harmonics and in the end

97
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,160
I'm left with just a sine wave so if we

98
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,250
go the other way we'll see that now I'm

99
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,260
adding like the third harmonic the fifth

100
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,590
harmonic and on up the chain until I get

101
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,709
a pretty good semblance of a square wave

102
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,780
now the ringing that you see here if I

103
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,580
added more

104
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,920
or or got less and less distortion that

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,730
would go away too

106
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,300
now this is an interesting observation I

107
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,370
want you to see this here I've got the

108
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,290
high pass and the medium pass turned on

109
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,880
in addition to the low pass and we're

110
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,340
looking at our square wave and look what

111
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,560
gets through the high pass it's the edge

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,140
this edge has a natural high frequency

113
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,680
we call it the Radian frequency 2pi f

114
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
this is where the energy comes from like

115
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,920
for FCC and emissions and when I say FCC

116
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,110
I mean trying to pass FCC regulations

117
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,900
it's not the one you know this an it

118
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,360
this fundamental frequency that gets

119
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,840
through that shows up so often in the

120
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,060
antennas of the receivers it's this

121
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,060
energy in this edge and if you can get

122
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,130
if you can wrap your mind around that

123
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,830
this is a big part of digital and

124
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,350
digital in the analog is understanding

125
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,820
the properties of the rising and falling

126
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,250
edges of a single I'm just sitting here

127
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,530
playing with different this kind of fun

128
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,260
actually but what I've done is and I

129
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,000
just froze the frame here

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,820
I gave it a 200 kilohertz sine wave and

131
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,919
it only gets through the high pass so

132
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,330
why I was doing it's a little messy I'm

133
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,070
not going to show you but as I manually

134
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,750
took the frequency up and down you would

135
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,970
see it first appear on low and then the

136
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,560
mid and the high there's a lot of

137
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,640
overlap this isn't a perfect filter you

138
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,350
know it's it's literally one chip but

139
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,419
it's a great start for seeing how this

140
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,910
stuff works all right I said I wasn't

141
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,070
going to do this to myself but uh let's

142
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,820
do it let's talk about real real active

143
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,890
filters and and if I gave you the

144
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,830
impression I don't do math well I do I'm

145
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,870
an engineer and maths a part of the job

146
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,060
and these days the tools are just just

147
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,850
fantastic the assortment you have the

148
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,370
part I was using the UAF 42 actually

149
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,740
they call out an old basic program it's

150
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,630
probably a Fortran written for a uni a

151
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,270
core so it won't run I think it needs a

152
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,000
15 bit dose machine or something but

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,620
even back then they were trying to pump

154
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,540
out basic programs and actually I I the

155
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,280
way I did dealt with some early Laplace

156
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,310
transform so I wrote a basic program in

157
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,370
1980 so I'm going to show you I just

158
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,930
pulled up web bench

159
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,720
off the off the internet it's a TI who

160
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,699
bought national and I'm sad that

161
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,380
Nationals gone they were my favorite

162
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,350
data book series but there's you know

163
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,949
analogs got you know analog comm I'm

164
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,840
sure has this kind of thing right built

165
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,990
into spice like the free ones ltspice

166
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,800
they all have filter uh programs and you

167
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,960
know you it was always possible to spice

168
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,280
this stuff together but what these

169
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,229
programs do then is help you create a

170
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:51,050
schematic afterwards so you you tell it

171
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,509
the parameters and it will show you then

172
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,050
what a actual active filter looks like I

173
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,639
want to show you is some active filter

174
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,509
so I want to tell you about the

175
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:00,919
different kinds even if we're not going

176
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,320
to play with them real heavily I want

177
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,639
you to know they're there so looking at

178
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,620
our screen here this is again this is

179
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,900
web bench from Texas Instruments and

180
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,300
right off the bat you start to remember

181
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,699
this you heard me call this a ripple

182
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,889
well that is this here's the slope

183
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:21,560
that'll be the 3d point you know which

184
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,259
which talks about the the you know where

185
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,150
in the frequency domain this starts to

186
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,919
kick in we call that little knee there

187
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,500
the three DB point and then how steep

188
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,300
this is kind of becomes our coin and

189
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,330
trade most a lot of the times not always

190
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,330
so if we go ahead and go into the filter

191
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,270
design what is interesting I'm gonna

192
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,750
make sure we can see it's just right

193
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,699
here you can choose if you haven't heard

194
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,190
these words Butterworth you know and and

195
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,530
that was the first filter I ever saw

196
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,120
when I started reading filter books I

197
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,470
don't think I've ever actually used a

198
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,060
Butterworth what we used to do was use a

199
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,460
Chevy Chevy followed by a vessel and

200
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,139
then if we had two more we do another

201
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,449
Chevy Chevron and our vessel and one of

202
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,009
the reasons was let's see if I can do it

203
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,009
i if you can see this here's our gain

204
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,300
response see they're trying to show you

205
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,099
all the different kinds I mean what a

206
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,389
great learning aid where you can

207
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,970
actually see these responses but let's

208
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,740
see that the Chevy chef does it ripples

209
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,509
its tail end off but it's got a real

210
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:20,150
steep you know and this happens to be a

211
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,400
group delay but it does the same thing

212
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,970
in amplitude and and and so what that

213
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,880
means is you get a real sharp corner but

214
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,200
you pay for it with some of this

215
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,029
bouncing around low if you follow it

216
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:34,849
with a vessel the Bessel in here is the

217
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,009
almost one and it's got what's called a

218
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:42,110
the group delay is same across the whole

219
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,300
frequency band so what that means is

220
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,019
that the low frequencies are delayed the

221
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,850
same amount as the high frequencies the

222
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,410
high ones aren't getting out in front of

223
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,110
the low ones so you know here we can

224
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,759
select all these different kinds and

225
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,560
right there the parameters and then this

226
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,380
will draw it for you and so we see that

227
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,240
it's it's really it's just it's kind of

228
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,610
what you saw for the UAF forty two for

229
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,529
calculating these this the program did

230
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:07,850
it for you how do we calculate we

231
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,740
calculated by doing a Laplace transform

232
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,509
that you can do a Fourier if you're

233
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,519
interested in a sense suit since

234
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,639
sinusoidal result which is more of a

235
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,750
continuous continuous stimulus for

236
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,639
moments moments a time moments of time

237
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,490
where am i where am I going to but we do

238
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,139
a Laplace transform when I say we I

239
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,569
usually get a piece of software or a guy

240
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,690
named Dave Haney to do it for me but

241
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,610
what that does is that means that we can

242
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,009
then calculate these things using just

243
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,110
multiplications and divisions and we

244
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,529
were doing floating point 1981 I was

245
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,740
using a 6502 at one megahertz doing

246
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,220
floating-point and we had about 180

247
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,189
milliseconds to do all this math so we

248
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,870
actually could do some digital filtering

249
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,089
in there and for example we never did a

250
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:58,279
division you you would take the

251
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,079
reciprocal multiplied won't fly so much

252
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,490
faster you just couldn't rock it to the

253
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,060
left each time right so there was tricks

254
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,620
but we found that we could reduce these

255
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,750
these laplacian coefficients all the way

256
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,610
down storm and ROM and just banging our

257
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,459
way through some of these so you know

258
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,550
this is what it looks like for a regular

259
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,050
filter not much different than what

260
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,019
we're doing so now let me tell you why I

261
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,439
actually did use the filter I used again

262
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:26,540
it's not because it doesn't use math

263
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,019
what that one did was it had just two

264
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,420
resistive components could control the

265
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,000
position in that filter and what I'm

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,860
going to do next in part two of this if

267
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,810
we if we want to let's not call part two

268
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,389
let's say another version in case I

269
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,040
screw up the design I want to be on the

270
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,699
hook for a part two but what that is is

271
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,970
is I'm going to put in a

272
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,560
an electronically controlled resistor

273
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,120
I'm going to control it with an SPI bus

274
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,580
so now I've got a filter I can control

275
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,280
with an Arduino a bus pirate whatever I

276
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,470
want to use and that's why I went with

277
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,240
that part was because I didn't have to

278
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,520
deal with the capacitors and and the

279
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,930
tolerances and all that I just found

280
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,280
something that I knew I could change a

281
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,020
couple resistors on and they're easy to

282
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,920
fake out right so bill heard on behalf

283
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,500
of hackaday I didn't mean to get in the

284
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,750
deep in here a little bit and I swear I

285
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,400
know you're not all going to agree with

286
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,520
me it'd just be polite when you disagree

287
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,680
but the you know a lot of times Swann

288
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,540
does I'm giving you about how I learned

289
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,700
to and sometimes that's almost good

290
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,160
enough I'd like to know the right way of

291
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,020
course but you know I've done

292
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,150
instrumentation before I did the real

293
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,160
mass quantities of Commodore and stuff I

294
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,890
produced or was an engineer doing real

295
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,770
high quality quality

296
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,780
weighing instrumentation so we did have

297
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,940
to I did have to get my analog chops in

298
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,310
order including grounding and loops and

299
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,620
noise and all that and we're gonna be

300
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,820
talking about that stuff too in the

301
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,950
future so Bill heard on behalf of

302
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,280
hackaday of let's see you next time
