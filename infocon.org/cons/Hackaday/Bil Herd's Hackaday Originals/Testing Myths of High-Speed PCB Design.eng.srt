1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:04,710
bill heard from hackaday today we're

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,049
talking about high speed design okay

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,570
what do I mean by high speed design well

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,150
in part it depends on what you're used

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,509
to and in part it's about when the rules

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,820
change we talked about conductivity as

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,369
electron flow in fact we had it all

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,230
wrong right will you show it picture

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,000
coming out of the plus side of the

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,769
battery and lighting the light bulb and

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,140
that is all about electron flow that's

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,690
about current but when we get to high

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,200
speeds and that's a funny definition too

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,610
because I don't just mean the

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,710
fundamental clock that's in your design

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,649
I mean the edges of those clock which

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,570
have a much higher high frequency

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,660
content than that fundamental frequency

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,149
and we'll talk about that so I've got

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,370
all my test equipment and I got the good

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,460
stuff fired up today I've got frequency

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,379
domain stuff such as my spectrum

23
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,809
analyzer and my vector network analyzer

24
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,049
and I've got a really accurate kind of

25
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,400
old but really accurate time domain

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,380
reflectometer and I can see picoseconds

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,549
with it a fraction of a nanosecond right

28
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,040
and doing that I can actually look at

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,080
what's going on on the height on the PC

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,009
board itself

31
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,610
and I've made PC boards to test it with

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,439
so let's get started

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,049
okay before we get started here I want

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,210
to make a comment about rules of thumb

35
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,700
Engineering's full of rules of thumb and

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,220
they do help when you're trying to you

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,900
know have twenty variables in your head

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,720
and you're you know you're trying to

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,790
start to plot that path through your

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,479
design goals in considerations but my

41
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,640
first rule of thumb is be cautious of

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,369
rules of thumb all right and we're

43
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,840
finding out more and more as our

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,090
equipment gets better that some of these

45
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,899
aren't based in fact and also medicine -

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,390
there's some things over there but rule

47
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,340
number one or a rule of thumb number one

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,920
for me is at high speed it's about the

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,970
e/m field the electromagnetic field not

50
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,730
electrons all right it's kind of like

51
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,830
the photon wave thing are you

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,320
is that particle or is it wave well I

53
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,480
solved for both so when I look at

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,700
something I look at it as if they are

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,250
electrons and I look at is if it is an

56
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,530
e/m field and we're going to talk about

57
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,100
the Yuma field consequently if it's not

58
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,990
about the electrons in the conductor but

59
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,550
this field that goes around the

60
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,590
conductor then I'll tell you that the

61
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,420
signal energy you know especially a

62
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,760
multi-layer PC board is in the

63
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,700
dielectric what the insulation yes

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,460
that's where the energy is all right

65
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,230
electrons aren't energy yes there's a

66
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,950
rest you masculine but the energy you

67
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,520
know this is Maxwell's world right it

68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,140
flows that damn near the speed of light

69
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,660
given some loss and some drag and some

70
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,780
other factors and these fields surround

71
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,120
the conductors and the intersect inside

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,010
the inside layers of a board and then

73
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,280
you have to design knowing that okay so

74
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,590
the third thing you're gonna like this

75
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,640
one is square corners might not matter

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,520
hardly at all that's a speed you're

77
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,100
using and I'll go into that a little bit

78
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,380
now I made an experiment to show you in

79
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,709
addition to the math so I hear a lot of

80
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,450
times it's like I've seen people it's

81
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,250
like they know one rule and it's like

82
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,920
don't use square corners if you if

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,390
that's the only rule you know you can

84
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,739
use square corners because it means

85
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,150
you're not dealing with the other 29

86
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,959
things so here's an Irwin for you on a

87
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,890
regular on a standard PC board the

88
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,420
impedance and we're going to talk about

89
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,150
impedance the impedance changes based on

90
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,459
the direction it flows on the board do

91
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,380
the glass weave having a directional

92
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,110
component to it I'll show you that I'll

93
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,470
show it I got the equipment here is an

94
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,340
edge on of a multi-layer board in this

95
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,770
case I've shown to ground plane and then

96
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,459
there is a conductor in the middle and

97
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,820
it's surrounded by dielectric so this is

98
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,440
actually a three layer board in other

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,140
words ground signal ground what you see

100
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,430
is first off around the conductor is the

101
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,350
magnetic field in a way to recognize

102
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,750
magnetic field as it tries to form a

103
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,080
circle whereas the

104
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,900
electric field the e of e/m couples to

105
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,229
the return path as well as the conductor

106
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:41,120
so tries to include the return path so

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,550
this becomes one animal from here to

108
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,250
here here it is the energy is in the

109
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,289
dielectric by the way what's the

110
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,629
difference here's a Rick Hartley for you

111
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,819
what's the difference between light and

112
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:57,259
electricity frequency all right now this

113
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,419
is important and this goes back to the

114
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,460
last video I did about inductance and

115
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,190
the bigger the loop the higher the

116
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,370
inductance at high frequencies and this

117
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,969
is all again if this is iam field

118
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:13,669
creates this phenomenon it takes the

119
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,580
path of least impedance not the path of

120
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,650
least resistance okay

121
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,779
no impedance has some resistance in it

122
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,740
yes but if if here is the source of the

123
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,139
voltage current gosh I keep saying

124
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,590
voltage source of the current by the way

125
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,479
Maxwell's equations don't actually talk

126
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,159
about Moldy john told you actually have

127
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,169
to derive that from it because it's all

128
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,110
about energy if this was a light bulb

129
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,900
and this was a battery the signal the

130
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,969
the signal would flow to the light bulb

131
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,000
and then come back diagonally right just

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,690
low frequency kind of electrons but at

133
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,509
high frequency it as it propagates down

134
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,279
to here and it's going to do it at the

135
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,740
Bossa T factor of the PC board so we're

136
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,659
talking huge fractions of the speed of

137
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,139
light right iam field bang bang it

138
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,629
follows the single path in the return

139
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:11,180
path so the blue is the ground playing

140
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,729
this fringy color is the current density

141
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:17,110
on the ground plane or representing the

142
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,750
the return cart and the purple is the

143
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,240
signal path itself on a signal layer

144
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,849
here's a diagram of the inside of a PC

145
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,610
board this is the glass weave that gets

146
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,430
a coat coated with epoxy as part of the

147
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,649
lamination putting these layers together

148
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,880
and the orange traces represe

149
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,820
traces on the PC board and if underneath

150
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,360
this was a ground plane or VCC pain

151
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,570
plane something of low impedance you can

152
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,270
see that the dielectric the insulate of

153
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,730
value for glass is different than the

154
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,820
value for just epoxy with no glass so if

155
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,710
the trace comes down the middle here

156
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,510
it's going to have a different impedance

157
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,900
than this way consequently a trace that

158
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,470
does go horizontally is going to have a

159
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,750
different impedance than a trace that

160
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,110
goes vertically and and there's

161
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,690
different weaves and they're becoming

162
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,750
more and more well-documented and the

163
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,540
answer to this is we need to have the

164
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,030
glass we've spread I have it rolled out

165
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,910
spread out so that the gaps are very

166
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,030
minor and of course this is a trade off

167
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,400
between again the adhesive of the epoxy

168
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,920
and the glass weave itself so guess what

169
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,900
you end up paying for this stuff as you

170
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,110
go further and further into the

171
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,710
high-speed design room ramifications but

172
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,870
I wanted to show you this because this

173
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,210
aren't did an experiment to see if I

174
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,180
could with my test equipment see if

175
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,950
there is a difference between going

176
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,350
horizontal vertical or at a 45 degree

177
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,970
angle all right here's a PC board and

178
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,500
actually I've got several of these that

179
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,710
I shot on to test this in this I used

180
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,620
PCB way and I've got their dimensions on

181
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,250
here in both metric and English that are

182
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,860
used to calculate the proper width to

183
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,260
get the proper impedance knowing that

184
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,510
this is not an impedance control board

185
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,000
I wanted results I could show you so I

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,070
used a regular old board not impedance

187
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,550
control PCB way was nice and sent me one

188
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,440
that was impedance controlled where I

189
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,039
could solder an SMA connector to it and

190
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,719
see the effect of a true controlled one

191
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,080
but I like this one because I've got a

192
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,270
horizontal look trace I've got a

193
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,099
vertical trace on the bottom you can't

194
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,290
see here and and if I were doing this

195
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,090
for real I'd have this in a stand that

196
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,070
gets you know so went laying flat it

197
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,810
doesn't pick up something so I've got

198
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,640
diagonal horizontal and vertical and

199
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,889
then I've got a trace with

200
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,499
is in it and then I've got a trace with

201
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,319
a whole bunch of right angles I don't

202
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:01,970
know if you can see it here but this

203
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,589
trace actually twice as long as the

204
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:05,540
others because there's some twenty or

205
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,839
thirty right angles no no radius to them

206
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,019
at all and we're going to test to see if

207
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,519
I can get that glare off for you a

208
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,579
problem with shiny black things we're

209
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,980
going to see about the right angles

210
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,639
before we're done worried about TDRs

211
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,459
time-domain reflectometer you know

212
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,709
they're used for cables right and and

213
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,279
we're measuring feet meters right

214
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,100
distances like that a slow-moving pulse

215
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,350
I can actually use the the frequency

216
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,540
generator built in my scope and a little

217
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,759
T coupling to create the pulse that goes

218
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,269
down and races back and get pretty

219
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:47,660
reasonable a resolution at PC board

220
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,629
speeds which is six inches per

221
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:53,629
nanosecond I need a really fast rise

222
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,279
time where it's still going to be going

223
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,049
up by the time the signals banged off

224
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,329
the end and come back it all gets muddy

225
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,989
right so this actually started out as a

226
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,899
video about making high-speed pulses I

227
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:08,989
I've got a whole folder here of step

228
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:12,860
recovery diodes of Avalanche transistors

229
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,610
in avalanche mode Jenny list did a

230
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,360
mercury wetted high-speed step pulse and

231
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,029
Alan woke on his channel shows you how

232
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,329
to make one with transistors so and I'm

233
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,160
just going to do that till I came across

234
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,160
let's get it here this little guy for

235
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,639
about sixty dollars this has 32

236
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,519
picosecond that's point zero zero zero

237
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,199
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero three

238
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:48,079
two seconds or if you're a nanosecond

239
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,589
sky like I am its 0.03 to of a

240
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:54,139
nanosecond and he did with laser drivers

241
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:57,589
which you know I got a believer are more

242
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,749
repeatable than avalanche mode of a

243
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:03,079
transistor so Leo Bart Bodnar comm is

244
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,970
where I got it for like 50 bucks I'm

245
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,949
never making a pulse generator again he

246
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,820
does

247
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,410
this is a CSA 8:03 I got off eBay this

248
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,680
is a communication signal analyzer and

249
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,899
what it is whereas an oscilloscope has

250
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,240
higher higher sampling rate than its

251
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,300
bandwidth this has lower sampling rate

252
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,089
than its bandwidth but it does multiple

253
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:30,100
traces there's no one trace that could

254
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,420
do 20 gigahertz this has a 20 gigahertz

255
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,750
bandwidth whoo nice eBay fine right so

256
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,370
in the pulse rate coming out of here

257
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,350
it's like some like 12 nano second 29 I

258
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,380
forgot to look it up but it's lots of

259
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,290
zeros and this little and so what that

260
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,740
speed of pulse does means I can see

261
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,950
individual features on a PC board let me

262
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,589
zoom in and we'll take a look here I'm

263
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:00,100
at half a nanosecond per division right

264
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,579
here is the 50 Cal fifty-caliber she's

265
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,310
been out of the army deal on 50 ohm of

266
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,800
the cable all right there's the the the

267
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,290
problem with the connector you notice

268
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,890
connectors aren't perfect and you'll see

269
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,959
that our impedance is just a little

270
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,329
higher than the cable but it's kind of

271
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,940
close so let's take a look at a vertical

272
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,980
direction and see what the impedance we

273
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,810
get from that here I've moved the cable

274
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,149
in the Terminator to a vertical

275
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,320
direction and and actually you can see

276
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,380
the backside of it the the the graddic

277
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,450
oh that's a graticule that's not lit up

278
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,940
real bright but this line is right on it

279
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,680
that's the 50 Cal of the cable and you

280
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,700
see our impedance actually is higher in

281
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,740
the vertical direction than it was the

282
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,529
horizontal direction so now the way

283
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,570
around this that if you want to if you

284
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,279
use standard boards I'm trying not to

285
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,199
call them cheap if you want to use

286
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,810
standard boards you can the board

287
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,480
to the side inside a bigger board so

288
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,940
that there are no angles running exactly

289
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,820
horizontal and exactly vertical they're

290
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,170
run and I think something like 11

291
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,440
degrees or 16 degrees or something gets

292
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,779
you enough mix a horizontal horizontal

293
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,620
and vertical we've components that

294
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,390
you get a better control of the

295
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,380
impedance here's this red impedance

296
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,180
control board you can see my SMA

297
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,090
connector there on the side and you see

298
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,750
we do have a much smoother experience if

299
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,240
you want to call it that now with that

300
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,030
said I can't put a termination on this

301
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,710
so it's not quite an apples apples

302
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,590
comparison but it is you know looking at

303
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,810
it from just one part is also doable and

304
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,090
in this case it looks like an impedance

305
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,480
control board to me now I've hooked to

306
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,720
the trace that has a bunch of vias on it

307
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,610
now I cheated I didn't these are the

308
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,710
worst case we as they are in tenez

309
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,660
they're acting like stubs there are

310
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,390
nasty little things and look what it did

311
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,670
by the way we fix that with things like

312
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,380
back drilling and stuff like that we'll

313
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,070
talk about that later if we do a true PC

314
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,290
board turnout here at two hundred

315
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,110
picoseconds per division can your scope

316
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,690
do this look look at what's going on

317
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,330
here right and what's great about this

318
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,320
is I can actually keep dialing in to see

319
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,030
the effect but look how much it came

320
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,920
down off of off of the 50 ohm so so vias

321
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,830
can have an effect in real life they

322
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,480
wouldn't be quite this bad because you

323
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,190
would do them better I just threw a

324
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,440
bunch of vias on there wondering if I'd

325
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,420
even see something that would show up

326
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,480
you know for a video for hack a day yes

327
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,940
they do so let's take a look at right

328
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,190
angles I know I'm dying to take over it

329
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,520
take a glance here's the board with a

330
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,390
whole bunch of right angles again no no

331
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,300
fill adeno no no radius you know

332
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,720
anything yes you can spot it there

333
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,770
that's them right there boy if this

334
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,900
matters a lot to you you're a better

335
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,720
engineer than me okay now in real life

336
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,220
this is not much you pick up other

337
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,880
artifacts and I'm going to show you a

338
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,520
formula because this this isn't you

339
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,280
can't say they're never important but

340
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,560
it's a ratio of the width to the

341
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,910
frequency that eric boe Girton

342
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,800
describe better than I can so I'm going

343
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,080
to show you that about when you do need

344
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,300
to worry about right angles and the

345
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,060
answer is yes yeah of couple gig and and

346
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,980
up yeah you do

347
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,190
but at frequencies especially our dwee

348
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,220
noise frequencies that they're there

349
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,020
nothing so go start a fight with

350
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,850
somebody over this one let me know how

351
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,830
it goes

352
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,390
so the whole argument about square

353
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,750
corridors had a couple of origins in in

354
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,840
the old days of RF at high high voltages

355
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,380
you would clip the little any any sharp

356
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,090
piece sticking out of the solder blob

357
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,640
because you'd get a Corona there

358
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,940
well I'm voltage does need to not have

359
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,600
corners yes but not at 5 volts three

360
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,230
volts or 1.8 bolt so the whole argument

361
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,970
came down to this represents this

362
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,730
triangle represents an additional width

363
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,070
so it comes along at one width it jumps

364
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,230
to a slightly greater width and then it

365
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,540
becomes a skinny width again and that

366
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,340
change in width is a greater capacitance

367
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,500
and so a change in impedance and yes all

368
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,610
of that's true

369
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,870
so two things one at six inches per

370
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,180
nanosecond this corner is going to go by

371
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,540
in a Pico second or you know some small

372
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,320
number so just the sheer speed of this

373
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,010
wave propagating down here and turning

374
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,400
you know it's just Dwarfs you that

375
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,430
little bump in the road and if you get a

376
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,010
PCB manufacturer it says Oh acid

377
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,040
collects in this corner get a different

378
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,290
PCB manufacturer I don't know that that

379
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,089
was ever true I think that came from

380
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,890
somewhere else like chip design or

381
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,880
something like that

382
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,020
so but Eric's done the math for us and

383
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,330
basically he's saying that in in mils

384
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,570
it's 1.6 femto farad's that's even

385
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,000
smaller in a Pico farad or a Pico farad

386
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,590
1.6 Pico farad 20 mils is 0.02 o of that

387
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,380
and you so it's very small capacitance

388
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,930
and he gave us a roll thumb Eric's known

389
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,530
for DES

390
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,080
finding rules of thumb I think he's got

391
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,790
one says watch out for rules of thumb

392
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,210
also but he says if you rise times less

393
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,150
than 10 picoseconds and you're doing 50

394
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,600
ohm you only have to worry about this if

395
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,300
you're trace is wider than 50 mils well

396
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,690
what for me to get 50 ohm on most of

397
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,700
boards I use you know I'm down five six

398
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,840
four seven mils I'm nowhere near 50 ohms

399
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,680
so I'll never come across this in what I

400
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,770
design I don't think so here's the

401
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,930
here's the whole argument about the

402
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,990
corner with math and this is from an edn

403
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,750
magazine where Eric posted one of his

404
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,090
rules of thumb so I didn't have

405
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,220
equipment like this back in the 80s it

406
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,410
existed I didn't have it when I worked

407
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,200
for Commodore hey we were only like one

408
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,150
of the top three computer manufacturers

409
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,150
here's a board I did that has a wire on

410
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,990
all of six million units 5.7 million and

411
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,410
it's because I got a real bad I'm gonna

412
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,360
stick a TDR on this I'm gonna pop the

413
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,400
wire off and see the difference maybe

414
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,690
make that a chaser video or something

415
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,570
where I just delay out sucked so bad

416
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,030
that I had to provide another pass so it

417
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,400
wouldn't reflect and do a reinforcement

418
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,330
cancellation thing I think waves write

419
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,850
on the board and my best fix was to add

420
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,650
a wire if we try to move the trace on

421
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,270
the board I might just move the problem

422
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,890
and I only had a couple months to do

423
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,830
this anyways so if I'd had this tool

424
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,150
back here I could have said aha

425
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,190
and still might have had the wire right

426
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,430
so I got to stop there man we're like

427
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,260
into twenty five minutes already in

428
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,640
these videos they're supposed to be ten

429
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,650
minutes long and I barely scratched the

430
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,260
surface of high-speed design stuff but

431
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,200
hopefully you start to see you know as

432
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,560
we go up in in rise times and we can we

433
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,840
can look under the covers and see the

434
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,240
impedance and start to care about what

435
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,910
the board is made out of and right

436
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,160
angles don't have the effect we thought

437
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,500
they did right when we were younger so

438
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,050
bill heard from hackaday I really hope

439
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,970
to make a second one of these where I

440
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,540
crack out my vector analyzer and

441
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,960
the the s-domain the the imaginary

442
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,470
domain of frequency and whatnot and I

443
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,080
even have my spectrum analyzer I'm gonna

444
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,730
go back to those corners to see if

445
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,590
they're spraying that's the other thing

446
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,550
they say is they emit emi which can hurt

447
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,780
you in ffcc not at these frequencies so

448
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,360
don't heard from hackaday i'll see you

449
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,330
on the next one
