1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,640
bill heard from hackaday welcome to part

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,970
2 of tearing into delta-sigma analog to

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,800
digital converters it's getting harder

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,139
to say every time in part 1 I talked

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,240
about the the lot of the theory I tried

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,010
to start a fight about quantization

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,949
error I I haven't yet said quantization

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,990
I'm doing good on that one I talked

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,970
about over sampling and noise shaping

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,710
which are all techniques used in the

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,599
Delta Sigma converters today I'm going

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,859
to show you the bench I'm going to show

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,570
you some stuff I built the thing I

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,120
almost built and we're actually going to

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,219
throw it on the spectrum analyzer and

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,840
we're going to end up with doing a

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,850
digital filter an FPGA just as a quick

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,450
example so tearing in a Delta Sigma ad

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,090
converters part two let's get started

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,379
I built a couple of different

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,420
implementations of a delta-sigma

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,510
modulator and let's review before I show

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,640
you the actual builds on those again

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,590
here it's comprised of a difference

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,539
amplifier an op amp it's got an

26
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,160
integrator which is an op amp with the

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,980
capacitor it's got a comparator which is

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,199
an op amp run in open-loop gain and

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,510
what's missing here is I actually used a

30
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,030
clocked comparator where the an external

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,400
clock tells it when to update so it's a

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,500
one bit flash ad converter and then a

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,210
switch that inverts the polarity of the

34
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,950
output and feeds it back I've

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,170
superimposed the block diagram on our

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,909
schematic here here we see the

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,500
difference amplifier up in the top

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,960
corner here's our integrator you see the

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,630
capacitor there here's our comparator

40
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,390
this one is a clocked comparator this is

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,430
a clock signal in and it's actually has

42
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,079
two polarities of output to choose from

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,180
and then I'm using a silicon switch to

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,150
emulate the switch the first schematic I

45
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,250
showed you what's called a single order

46
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,640
modulator here's a dual order modulator

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,259
which means we've got two things going

48
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,350
first two integrators where two feedback

49
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,409
paths going on and you know with the

50
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,439
second order it can either do something

51
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,450
much better than a first-order or if you

52
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,909
screw it up it can do it much worse so I

53
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,070
just wanted to show you this because we

54
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,259
did build one of these unfortunately we

55
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,060
didn't have time to really go into it in

56
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,098
time for this video forgive the weird

57
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,378
camera angles here today we've got a lot

58
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:11,930
going on on the bed

59
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,270
here's our first-order modulator that I

60
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,780
built

61
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,190
pretty straightforward yes to make

62
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,020
connectors for you know get the signal

63
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,480
on and off I have performed okay had a

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,190
little bit of problem with saturation in

65
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,730
one direction but it's alright one of

66
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,380
the ways I looked at building one was

67
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,630
also using a piece off five you can

68
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,190
actually put to push the components

69
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,400
around in the in the GUI for that and

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,720
there's even a digital filter and there

71
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,100
turned out to be the wrong kind but we

72
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,080
may talk about this with digital filters

73
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,030
was pretty cool what you can do for ten

74
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,959
bucks here's a module that is it's a

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,060
dedicated delta-sigma modulator and this

76
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,770
one's actually isolated I'll show you

77
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,709
what that means but this one was a fixed

78
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,570
clock frequency and I ended up using a

79
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,430
multiple clock frequency ones to show

80
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,630
you some of what we want to do here

81
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,510
today and then this just arrived this is

82
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,540
the circuit board for the dual pol

83
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,370
home-built delta-sigma modulator but

84
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,410
it's just it's too late I've need to get

85
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,060
this video done or I'm going to get

86
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,760
fired here's the datasheet for the

87
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,430
analog devices 7403 Sigma Delta

88
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,860
modulator that I ended up using it's a

89
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,870
self-contained modulator in this case it

90
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,269
by being isolated what we mean is

91
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,160
they're separate power supplies for the

92
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,900
input circuit in the output circuit and

93
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,970
there's electromagnetic coupling in the

94
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,260
middle well this is useful in

95
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,350
instrumentation and we actually asked

96
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,530
this in the the comments section of the

97
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,260
last analog-to-digital a post I did how

98
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,810
do you create this isolation in some

99
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,540
cases you do it on the output this one's

100
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,640
done closer to the input say a thousand

101
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,410
volts got shorted to your analog and you

102
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,580
don't want her to get into the computer

103
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,310
measuring it this is the typical of

104
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,160
isolation this is a good place to do

105
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,260
isolation because there's only two bits

106
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,150
we have to isolate there's the clock and

107
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,739
there's versions of this where the

108
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,450
clocks is an output instead of an input

109
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,850
same thing though we just isolate one

110
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,100
bit for the clock in one bit for the

111
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,380
data and we don't have to do 16 or 24

112
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,080
bits for the data so this is the guy on

113
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,060
the bench and let me show you some of

114
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,560
the scope on this guy show you how he's

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,180
working here's the output of the

116
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,220
modulator as seen with a sine wave and

117
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,079
you can see the variations at the highs

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,450
and the lows here with the square wave I

119
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,400
did this just to kinda show you the

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
contrast between the two highs and low

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,460
signals so

122
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,139
looks like gobbledygook and then a

123
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,449
triangle wave so believe it or not their

124
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,919
stuff encoded in here and we're going to

125
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,410
look at that closer but there really is

126
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,330
here's nothing so you would expect

127
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,610
random stuff to look random and then

128
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,099
back to a sine wave here's a live output

129
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,069
of the delta-sigma modulator and I'm

130
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:46,490
going to freeze it and we can see a

131
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,520
single snapshot of the of the

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,330
interpretation of a sine wave so back to

133
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,250
run Heights my sine wave a little bit

134
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,620
but is there really a sine wave in there

135
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,050
well I'm going to use a function on the

136
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,660
scope called average and you can see it

137
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,160
build it down there it's noise of course

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,009
but and I can change the the size of the

139
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,370
average so there's 32 I'm actually

140
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,020
surprised it works this good with an

141
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,870
average of 16 samples but then all the

142
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,330
way up to 512 and loma' holders really a

143
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,940
signal modulated just in that digital

144
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,820
output like that alright back in the

145
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,639
frequency domain remember to the left is

146
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,409
a low frequency to the right is a high

147
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,800
frequency and this is the a spectrum

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
analyzer that shows us this this running

149
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,250
a fast FFT a fast Fourier transform to

150
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,139
display this and then I've got a signal

151
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,599
generator hooked up and remember what we

152
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,099
said that over sampling by 4 gets us

153
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:48,409
another effective bit of resolution in

154
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,710
other words approximately 6 dB so let's

155
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,419
go ahead and change our sample frequency

156
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,180
which is currently 5 megahertz as you

157
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,180
can see here if we change it to 20

158
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,180
megahertz now watch the screen watch the

159
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,360
noise baseline boom down it goes mayor

160
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,289
fact it uncovered some noise good for us

161
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,419
but right there it is it actually works

162
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,849
we did it by a factor 4 and dropped our

163
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:16,509
noise we'll take it back to 5 megahertz

164
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,820
and the noise floor will come up on us

165
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,219
you'll see we have a lot less room

166
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,190
between the top and our noise now so

167
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,509
over sampling works this is cool if you

168
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,610
remember this drawing where we showed

169
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,250
noise shaping where we tried to push the

170
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,469
noise into a curve shooting off to the

171
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,599
right the higher frequencies remember

172
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,529
later we wanted

173
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,659
we passed this so that only this part

174
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:44,329
gets through but remember this where we

175
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,189
did this let's see if this is also

176
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:47,629
taking effect now

177
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:50,809
all right I've expanded the span on the

178
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,669
spectrum analyzer here so it's 2

179
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,709
megahertz from side to side it was a lot

180
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:57,799
smaller earlier and sure enough here is

181
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:01,369
our our hump from our digital noise

182
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,829
shaping over here on the left now let's

183
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,529
watch what happens when I once again re

184
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,389
increased the sample frequency by a

185
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,089
factor for up to 20 megahertz boom and

186
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,979
down it goes again we've uncovered our

187
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,529
noise and now the hump is shoved even

188
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,629
further off to the right and so our

189
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:22,879
techniques have really bought us some

190
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,769
some signal to noise ratio here in a

191
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:26,599
positive way back to our block diagram

192
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,439
of the of the Sigma Delta analog to

193
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,079
digital converter the whole thing we've

194
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,119
just gone over the modulator in detail

195
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:37,489
here creating this type waveform so now

196
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,259
we have two more pieces remaining we

197
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,419
need we have the integrator the digital

198
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,659
filter that combines and averages these

199
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,879
pulses and turns into single bit pulse

200
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,699
and turns it into a multi bit pulse or /

201
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,649
number that we can use internally and

202
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,169
then the decimator which then takes this

203
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,299
overabundance information you saw it on

204
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,849
on the spectrum analyzer all that

205
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:01,159
information but all the stuff we were

206
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,829
interested in was way off to the left so

207
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:05,719
we want to decimate ourself which means

208
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,319
to remove the unwanted stuff and you can

209
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,519
look up what it means it's an

210
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,389
interesting story

211
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,899
but the we remove it down to just the

212
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,239
amount of sampling we need to get the

213
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,539
job done I'm showing the the logic

214
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,859
behind the both sets of digital filters

215
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:27,409
simultaneously here and and so one way

216
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:28,699
to realize what we're doing is there's

217
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,679
two clocks there's two clock domains

218
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,469
there's a clock on the input and a clock

219
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,208
on the output because there are two

220
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,708
different frequencies one's the high

221
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,688
frequency of all those bits streaming in

222
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:41,029
the other is the lower frequency of the

223
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,159
final decimated value at the at the

224
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,499
sample frequency that we want to end up

225
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:48,470
with so and and here's how we read this

226
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,329
as the input signal goes through a

227
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,089
summation and a time delay z is a time

228
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:53,830
to

229
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,510
you know whatever amount in this case

230
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,870
one o'clock and in it feeds back some of

231
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,330
that and get some dinna ghin but also

232
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,460
goes on to the next stage which does the

233
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,810
same thing and delay in the next thing

234
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,090
so this is an averaging filter of moving

235
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,730
averaging filter where the output coming

236
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,530
out of here is the average of going

237
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,120
through all these steps of summing with

238
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,670
itself and ending up with a number that

239
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,280
has noise filtered out of it also

240
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,880
because of the way something works and

241
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,690
integrating coming out of our

242
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,540
integrating accumulation process now we

243
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,360
go to the decimator so this drops down

244
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,190
to here and now we see in the summation

245
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,260
that it's starting to subtract it out

246
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,450
and again the same thing of these these

247
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,390
are Z as a time delay and we are taking

248
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,570
the results removing information from it

249
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,110
at a different rate and finally we get

250
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,510
our output the combination of these two

251
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,440
is sometimes called a CIC filter cascade

252
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,030
integrating comb filter I'll show that a

253
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,520
little bit more it's also it's called a

254
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,430
sinc filter si NC 2 which refers to the

255
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,990
song and nature of it and where it's

256
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,550
centered and stuff here in the datasheet

257
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,090
for the ad 7403

258
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,620
it's such a good datasheet that they go

259
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,540
ahead and show us the characteristics

260
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,760
needed for the digital filter they show

261
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,950
us the curves and and the decimation

262
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,680
rate and everything and then they

263
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,050
actually give us an example in Vera log

264
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,190
of a digital filter and if the if we

265
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,080
look here here's our accumulator

266
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,300
function that I showed here's our

267
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,120
decimation function I showed and then

268
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,520
they show the different rates to program

269
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,680
it for for the different responses to

270
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,050
get you going so what I'm going to do is

271
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,180
I'm going to just snag this bit of code

272
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,640
in reality I had to do some typo fixing

273
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,490
but we're gonna snag this bit of code

274
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,670
and we're going to drop it into the FPGA

275
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,960
all right I'm gonna run you through the

276
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,500
process

277
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,250
real fast way too fast for creating a

278
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,310
digital filter based on having a piece

279
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,770
of error log as your filter and I'm

280
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,330
going to do this in Cortis I'm actually

281
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,360
using cordis 15 which is fairly modern I

282
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,860
use a lot of the old courtesans

283
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,810
sometimes depend

284
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,570
what I'm doing but let's get started so

285
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,040
first thing I'm going to do so I'm going

286
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,340
to import my assignments for the PC

287
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,890
board I'm using I've already worked with

288
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,510
it before I've got a little assignment

289
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,290
thing boom don't need to make a backup

290
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,680
boom and there's there's all my pins and

291
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,870
everything that I'll need and the pin

292
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,810
numbers so this matches to my board so

293
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,270
go back to project navigator do files

294
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:40,500
add remove files from project and here

295
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,930
is our decimator as a I'm sorry our

296
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,400
digital filter as a as a ver log file I

297
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,170
like to start with a top schematic file

298
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,180
it's just habit of mine so we're going

299
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,910
to do that I'm going to switch so here

300
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,950
it is this is typed in this is the what

301
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,700
you saw in the datasheet so we are now

302
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,190
going to create a symbol for this which

303
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,500
will actually compile it alright it says

304
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,420
it created the symbol successfully I'm

305
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,430
going to go back to my top sheet I'm

306
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,020
going to insert a symbol

307
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,890
there's the symbol for the bear log that

308
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:41,250
we did and I can now do generate pins

309
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,519
for symbols and I would go in and number

310
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,630
these if they weren't already assigned

311
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,310
now a reason why I use the top sheet a

312
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,140
lot of times I had test points and all

313
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,480
kinds of other things so let's go ahead

314
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,560
and compile this again okay full

315
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,079
compilation was successful normally I

316
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,540
would go into my modelsim and create

317
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,880
stimulation simulation all that good

318
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,640
stuff but that's why I've been doing the

319
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,740
last week so I'm going to go ahead and

320
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:23,149
program it output files and start okay

321
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,360
it's now running on the bench doing that

322
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,130
piece of air log code that we looked at

323
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,649
this code right here and that's one way

324
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,240
to get your digital filter and again we

325
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,089
talked about what our FPGA is good for

326
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:41,040
well this is one of the things you could

327
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,990
have whole bunches these running in

328
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,149
parallel all kinds of things remember

329
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:46,920
code deck can't work in parallel

330
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,230
typically code works a single

331
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,209
instruction at a time by code I mean in

332
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,970
a microprocessor now let me show you

333
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,149
another way to do a filter in altaira

334
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,230
I'm sure that Xilinx can do this as well

335
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,880
they all have what they call their VIP

336
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,459
suites or they're a high-end Suites of

337
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,709
tools in this case we're going to go

338
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,649
into a thing called Q sis which is a

339
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:17,670
system builder okay and I've been in

340
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,990
here already playing around with a

341
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,779
little bit but if we go to the filter

342
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,140
specification turns out I can choose

343
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,060
different kinds of filters that are

344
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,490
pre-built there is a finite infinite

345
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,920
response

346
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,279
I'm sorry finite impulse response type

347
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,810
filter which actually has the

348
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,459
coefficients and stuff we're all used to

349
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,310
and that's for a different video then we

350
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,199
have the C I see the cascade integrator

351
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,819
comb filter that we're working on so

352
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:45,030
I've

353
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,540
I've selected that and in here we decide

354
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,980
what kind of stage we've already said

355
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,210
it's it's a decimator

356
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,250
we set the number of stages the

357
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,130
differential delay different factors in

358
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,410
it and at the end of the day these

359
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,540
combine to make our output data with and

360
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,950
so right built in right to Altera's tool

361
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,770
set is a CIC filter so here's another

362
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,360
way to do it we generate our HD HDL we

363
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,010
even tell it we want it to well that's

364
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,900
the simulation model but we said do you

365
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,030
want to generate this code as vert log

366
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,870
or VHDL I tend to do Vera log and we now

367
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,730
we're making a filter program from a

368
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,430
wizard there's advantages and

369
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,680
disadvantages but I wanted to show this

370
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,730
to you again if you were doing an F IR

371
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,220
filter you do that you can do this and

372
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,920
still go outside and build your your

373
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,530
coefficients in math lab or I found an

374
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,330
Excel spreadsheet online and I found a

375
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,220
guy that's got a filter builder online

376
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,620
where you can copy the coefficients from

377
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,650
and bring them into into Vera lera I'm

378
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,800
sorry into cordis okay it tells me it's

379
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,430
finished compiling it closed we can

380
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,570
actually get out of we'll just minimize

381
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:07,430
it and now when we go to insert a symbol

382
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,570
there's a symbol for the for the device

383
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,149
we just built and it's got a lot more

384
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,180
things you can go in and manage the

385
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,830
different control signals that uses

386
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,980
something it uses a custom bus that's

387
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,990
got called the Avalon bus so it's got

388
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,540
like ready and wait and signals like

389
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,270
that but again if you want to shortcut

390
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,820
it we just generate pins for all these

391
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,700
run them together and now we've got a

392
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,130
filter built with a wizard inside of

393
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,070
cordis alright we're on the homestretch

394
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,899
here I wanted to show I've been playing

395
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,149
like for a while here getting ready for

396
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,649
this video with different things I have

397
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:52,140
an analog evaluation board here a DC

398
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,420
evaluation and remember I'm always doing

399
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,610
low R to R Dax well now I've got my own

400
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,320
data you know a DAC chip that happened

401
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,600
to be parallel this was a parallel card

402
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,089
and I was streaming information from ADC

403
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,250
back to DAC and doing different things

404
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,140
but at the end of the day didn't do much

405
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,839
for us but I'm going to show you this

406
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,510
this is an evaluation board that cost me

407
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,290
too much money don't tell my wife for

408
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,329
Delta Sigma Sigma Delta type a DC

409
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,559
converters but allows us to

410
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,109
interactively change the decimation rate

411
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,910
things like that so let's play with this

412
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,589
here right in the end

413
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,809
alright here's the board I honestly

414
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,309
thought it'd be more useful for showing

415
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:32,010
you the actual manipulation of the

416
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,190
digital data but I was wrong but let me

417
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,370
show to you what it is useful for so it

418
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,230
does have the FPGA stuff I was doing

419
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,600
with the RAM and this has an interactive

420
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,760
control of a device similar to the one

421
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,950
we use this is a full system called the

422
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,610
ad 7760 of course it needed SMB

423
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,130
connectors and XLR so I had to get all

424
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,200
that working and at the end of day what

425
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,300
we got was this interface right here and

426
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,809
at first glance well it is kind of cool

427
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:05,550
I've got it frozen right now let's put

428
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,410
it we can see the waveform we can see

429
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,520
the frequency domain so time domain here

430
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,500
frequency domain here let's put it in a

431
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,890
continuous operation this goes useless

432
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,480
but here is our FFT that we're used to

433
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,580
in the frequency domain and what was

434
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,440
interesting is I could go in here and

435
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,200
could actually change the filter there's

436
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,039
the filter default coefficient depth

437
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,980
basically I consent you can import file

438
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,549
folders or files of filter coefficients

439
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,710
we can manipulate things like the over

440
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,080
range and that kind of stuff we can take

441
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,120
a look at the modulator output oh what's

442
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,539
this

443
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,149
is that noise shaping going on yes it is

444
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:51,059
and then we've got things like the

445
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,759
number of samples we use on the input

446
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,500
and watch I just set it to a high number

447
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,840
and it's going to slow down but go down

448
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,370
alright so we were integrating in RC RC

449
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,200
filter at the front part of it we're

450
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,179
integrating a whole bunch of samples

451
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,250
five hundred twenty four thousand in

452
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,570
this case let's go back to something

453
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,419
useful and then our decimation rate

454
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,220
member the part we end up dividing it

455
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,830
down for now if you do it without really

456
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,629
taking care of your date you you end up

457
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:21,659
changing the frequency you think you're

458
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:24,269
spotting if you decimate at an improper

459
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,799
rate and so that's one thing cool about

460
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,529
this so I know the frequency I'm putting

461
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:30,710
into it so I set it back and there's my

462
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,340
correct value so kind of interesting

463
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,090
display if you were researching or using

464
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,529
this part it's very interesting because

465
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:46,019
it gives you the actual high marnik

466
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,210
distortion the signal-to-noise ratio

467
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,759
everything is spelled spurious frequency

468
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,379
everything is spelled out for you as

469
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,629
measured so it actually is very good if

470
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:56,909
you're doing this for real and not two

471
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:01,980
minutes in a video all right in the

472
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,070
words of chevy chase spock frankly

473
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,740
captain i'm exhausted we covered a lot

474
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,149
of ground hopefully it's gives you a

475
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:10,860
better understanding that i left last

476
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,500
time frankly about ad converters and

477
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,259
noise and and in the artifacts of

478
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:18,269
resolution that kind of thing who knows

479
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,610
maybe someday I'll have need to stuff my

480
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,679
little Sigma Delta modulator it's a two

481
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,649
pole by the way so with that said Bill

482
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:26,879
heard from hackaday

483
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:28,860
hope to catch you on the next one maybe

484
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,899
we'll tackle something not quite so long

485
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:33,990
and too complicated maybe I'll make a

486
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,690
squirt in my car they'll heard from

487
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,580
hackaday have a good
