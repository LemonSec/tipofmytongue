it's going to be pushed under an

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,950
avalanche of Commodores and that's

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,899
Robert Bernardo the president of the

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,329
president of Commodore users group in I

16
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,430
was an EMT for many years and we call

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,620
that the secondary injuries when the

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,539
things inside the car we called the

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,340
tertiary injury when your brain actually

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,860
slaps the front of your skull so far and

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,570
how long have you been coming here to

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:04,769
these and why did you choose Vegas to do

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,000
this alright it's a happening place

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,420
okay okay so local right there's a

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,970
little bit of extra traction as opposed

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,340
to a Cincinnati Ohio or something like

27
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:26,890
that and what do you have here that's a

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:34,810
metal one okay

29
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,750
uh no rambling this is not a Commodore

30
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,450

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,850
right right beautiful designs that okay

32
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,490
and so with the millions of common air

33
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,460
products salts such as the Commodore 64

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,590
there was a huge market I take it for a

35
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,590
after market thing CMD being one of them

36

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,800
for ten minutes before and it's just you

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,660
know I wouldn't be around if it wasn't

43
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,700
for the company his father made right so

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,580
so what do you have here you have a 128

45
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,690
also went 120 also it's the 30th

46
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,180
anniversary of this exactly in that put

47
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,410
on a 1541 ultimate card no I actually

48
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,170
know nothing about the add-ons might I'd

49
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,060
be embarrassed except they came after so

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,860
long after me it doesn't matter and I

51
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,549
have money okay and that's just that the

52
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:51,850
Omega monitor right works any way we

53
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,560
define automatically see the character

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,450
line noise and there say that right now

55
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,600
I know what causes that it's in the Vic

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,430
chip it's actually it's an interaction

57
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,920
with the monitor the modulator and the

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,250
Vic chip

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,780
sixty-four month just because now you

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,310
know about home down the Commodore key

61
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,910
right right yeah I am better at that we

62
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,270
had to we needed the z80 to get involved

63
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,430
early so we now do you know about the

64
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,630
Easter Egg and the Commodore went

65
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,020
rainbow I read somewhere in actually

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,300
last year but two years ago at one of

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,030
this convention they gave a paper that

68
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:37,170
show put it in 128 mode let's try it and

69
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,120
the guys put this in without telling me

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,130
because they knew that I if ever they

71
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,750
ran out of ROM I would tell them to pull

72
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,430
it out because I did want to hear them

73
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,740
complaining about being out of ROM if

74
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,280
they had the room for an easter egg so

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,260
this three to three to eight hundred

76
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,600
comma one to three comma four five comma

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,430
six inner

78
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,680
and that's us so it's brought to you by

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,150
software fred bowen Terry Ryan Vaughan

80
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,550
or twine Fred did the colonel Terry did

81
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,770
the version basic which somebody asked

82
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,660
me yesterday why we were still using

83
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,029
basic from Microsoft and the answer is

84
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,649
we didn't we just had to leave their

85
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,230
copyright notice up but Terry rewrote it

86
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,420
literally from ground up and then Bonner

87
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,420
winded the cp/m so what I didn't know

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,400
was that this was in there and they have

89
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,990
my name in there but then they put in

90
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,570
the name heard where to represent my

91
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,030
last name Dave hey me and Frank play of

92
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,740
course Dave's well-known for the Omega

93
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,200
stuffing in there so and link arms don't

94
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,960
make them that's that's Terry Ryan the

95
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,570
the vegetarian of the group and we

96
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,250
always got messages when we first turned

97
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,650
things up I was taught there early age

98
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,330
don't take any wooden nickels buy the

99
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,890
messages that Terry would show up

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,630
comment it's a piece comment yeah

101
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,120
absolutely is yes you meet all kinds of

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,400
these kind of old conventions and this

103
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,500
here was a middle manager yep back in

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,770
the days at Commodore he was in travel

105
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,080
he's still making the same noises he

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,100
worked in the software engineering

107
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,770
department and thought we should still

108
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,390
be doing everything the hard so we

109
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,280
should and your name is I am

110
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,910
Theodore sheepdog yeah you were in

111
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,169
charge of software I remember yes yeah

112
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:31,210
so did I yes I had hair back then so

113
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,700
does the dog own any Commodore Gators

114
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,620
yes yes I worked with the kids a glad

115
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,530
tiding assembly and we have a Commodore

116
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,660
128 never heard of it right so that was

117
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,790
like a doorstop for Barnes that came out

118
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,740
back in the 80s well no that was a great

119
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,229
wonderful computer it has two computers

120
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,050
in one you can use a 64 version or the

121
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,729
128 version and it's really really

122
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,010
really really really

123
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:02,100
fun or CPU CPM what is that well that's

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,170
you know being a dog it's it's

125
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,460
understanding you try doing it with

126
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,680
these paws you try that the well you

127
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,350
know can you operate a bt 102 board

128
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,910
that's how we design the keyboard on the

129
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:22,890
128 well first of all what okay so every

130
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,140
always check the dog don't give me a

131
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,040
hard time all right

132
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,170
no that's I'll call I'll call the parent

133
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,030
I've no no pound for me I've done that

134
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,660
before

135
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,230
the foots rot right and you live life in

136
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,240
dog years so it's just life short enough

137
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,810
I'm 70 yeah yeah we used it we used to

138
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,000
kid about that at Commodore because we

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
live compressed time yeah we slept what

140
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,010
did you do it coming on uh well we're

141
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,980
filming you what did I do it yes oh you

142
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,210
are filming me yes we are

143
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,770
well I was an engineer at Commodore back

144
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,040
in the 1980s and I designed the

145
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,260
Commodore 128 yep yep and now that was

146
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,790
an unusual computer because the

147
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,010
management had left didn't tell us what

148
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,500
to do so I actually took a piece of

149
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,160
paper

150
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
set it down my desk and drew it out and

151
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,730
then ran with it

152
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,160
yeah so it was it was a time when four

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,140
people could could make a computer and

154
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,960
take it to production yes you could and

155
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,760
the team grew as we got there that it

156
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,070
all came from a piece of paper very good

157
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:31,500
so I'm bill hurt as in hardware and then

158
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,840
Hardware heard we're heard we're how

159
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,340
about dog where I've heard of that

160
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,220
really yes you can use it with paws yes

161
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,520
pause one point thank you very much very

162

165
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,210
the Las Vegas computer of what's name

166
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,439
you're gonna question five seats okay

167
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,259
and so you do computing power okay

168
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,659
and so you're one of the reasons that

169
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:02,789
they're here in Vegas is because of the

170
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,569
local Packer okay so show us what you

171
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,309
got here live CD TV and I've got a

172
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,589
keyboard mouse and drive is this is a

173
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:15,869
what CD TV okay

174
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,300
and it's the complete set so to run

175
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,479
workbench and amitabh programs are

176
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,959
floppy as well as off the CDs and and

177
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,119
what year is the state do you think I've

178
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:33,328
got 92 I think okay okay right so what I

179
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:35,009
call during act three of the Greek

180
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,360
tragedy in three acts

181
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,649
I brought my SX and these were cool they

182
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,929
mean there were transportable computers

183
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,550
back in the day such as kaypro and

184
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,949
Osbourne's but none of them are really a

185
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,990
color game machine and this did

186
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,959
everything a Commodore 64 did everything

187
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,079
and and it's going one system and so we

188
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,910
carry these around but then you ended up

189
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,560
with bruised ankles carrying the netting

190
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,360
things from the slightly off-center

191
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,720
weight so and how long have you had this

192
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,060
well this one in my first one this one

193
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,740
here

194
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,750
five years and did you have one in the

195
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,240
original I had one not when it was

196
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,890
brand-new but I got one back on the

197
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,000
night okay

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,880
we had a gold version of the Commodore

199
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,130
64 for the 10 millionth the Commodore 64

200
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,070
had you you've maybe heard of that I

201
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,880
don't know and the story goes that when

202
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,950
they went to find the 10 10 millionth

203
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,930
one to pick it out the guy walked into

204
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,500
the back of the R&D lab stood in front

205
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,810
of a junk pile going it's here somewhere

206
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,320
hmm there it is and he picks out one and

207
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,900
we spray paint her to gold and so we

208
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,490
added a glass case so people couldn't

209
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,350
tell it was only painted and that was

210
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,840
the company way so well excellent thank

211
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,010
you for the show here it's been

212
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,290
excellent and it's great great meeting

213
00:09:52,290 --> 00:10:02,400
you and we'll see what else hold on hold

214
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,800
on they got it all done and then we have

215
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,600
these replica t-shirts that the CPM

216
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,880
engineers wore back of the day back in

217
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,740
bill nerds day realistic my day and can

218
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,650
you explain what a jack buster is what

219
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,750
is this t-shirt what is a Jack Buster

220
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,360
well let's see let's it the CPM engineer

221
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,580
who told me this story was like this was

222
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,740
after Jack Tramiel had left the

223
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,200
engineering department wanted to wear

224
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,240
these what are these things angels in

225
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,130
the engineering department and they

226
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,820
built these and this was a playoff

227
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,540
ghostbusters back in the day and we

228
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,970
actually did it for the CES show oh so

229
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,890
yeah we took him specific that we got

230
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,690
him like a couple days before the CES

231
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,010
show during setup and stuff we did yes

232
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,460
yes waiver digging hard so it's a you

233
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,100
know a wise man once told me or once

234
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,210
said that business is war Jack Tramiel

235
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,090
said that so once he once he declared

236
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,270
war everything was legal okay got it

237
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,820
all right in what's your name Jim drew

238
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,740
and how many of you been coming to these

239
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,100
my fourth one I think I got there about

240
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,639
four years ago okay in why why retro

241
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,009
white white Commodore well I've done

242
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:32,829
worse since 1977 okay right so this is

243
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:34,209
kind of like return to some of your

244
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,240
roots or at least the knowledge the

245
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,249
products uh until the death of Commodore

246
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,259
and we actually stayed in open business

247
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,230
how I tell 97 the other thing you can

248
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,410
show real quick actually make a new

249
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,509
product that's called a supercar back in

250
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,679
the day I made a product called super

251
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,499
card which was a expansion before the

252
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:54,699
disk drive okay

253
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:56,889
so this is a modern version of it in

254
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,649
what planet technology is it using using

255
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,990
a microprocessor now which one I picked

256
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,610
my growth okay

257
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,309
very popular it's running it 40 myths

258
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,819
right and basically emulates whatever

259
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,730
you need it to do in code so I've did

260
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,929
this I've got another device and I'm

261
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,100
working on right now is called a micro

262
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,740
Drive this is actually is a complete

263
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,309
1541 disk drive emulation exact well

264
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,290
including the bug some stuff yeah

265
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,939
exactly is your predator bug in the

266
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:26,470
whole nine yards

267
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,240
okay what was that I was talking about

268
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,399
yesterday where we didn't they did not

269
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,920
write qualify the roms in the fifteen

270
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,459
forty ones

271
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:34,839
oh yeah that's where you can actually

272
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,429
write to them you could ruin that yeah

273
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,110
you got a Trojan that would break your

274
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,589
disc drive

275
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,389
yeah because the designers who weren't

276
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:43,779
from our group had had said yeah here's

277
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,309
the address for the ROM the read-only

278
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:46,839
memory but they didn't look at the

279
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,129
readwrite line let's see if it was a

280
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,679
read cycle for the read-only memory so

281
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,769
it's it in a write loop and to repeat

282
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,730
until burnt you know got a bad deed at

283
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,529
that point excellent

284
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,299
well well thank you for your time here

285
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,189
if being problem if this goes up on

286
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:04,520
hackaday if that makes a three

287
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,290
taxi so how are you doing what's your

288
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,280
name John Brown this is just your first

289
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,200
convex or do you come to all of these

290
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,940
some of my sat.1 okay

291
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,000
and and why do you come to this I grew

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,040
up with the Commodore I admire the label

293
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,750
in my town with my friends as the

294
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,110
Commodore wear with pride nerd though on

295
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:33,510
my wife and what was your first computer

296
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:44,730
my Victoria there you go you got a tape

297
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,380
drive so of course everything was nice

298
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,130
and saw mass storage yep mass tort and

299
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,170
then my dad came home for the 1541 and

300
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,360
man we owe massimo throw on from that

301
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,700
slow storage floor the cassette now my

302
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,320
deal is I want to make sure that all

303
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,450
these games are so long software

304
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,330
Preservation Society and Jim with the

305
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,250
supercar throw in the cryo flex team in

306
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,860
German I bought these drives so that

307
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,540
they can read the disk correctly now now

308
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,270
if I were to design the 64 in an FPGA or

309
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,830
something like that is there a software

310
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,080
base I could use or not really it's it's

311
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,530
it's it's it's there but you're not

312
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,300
really can sell a product using the old

313
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,130
Commodore 64 games the trademark still

314
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,630
exists so when jeri ellsworth did the

315
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,180
DTV they went out and got those licenses

316
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,490
is my understanding is yeah that you can

317
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,100
put an entire Commodore system

318
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,960
yes you couldn't back back in the day

319
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,240
but you can now yeah yeah and there and

320
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,610
especially there was too much

321
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,410
non-digital going on back in the day to

322
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,020
put it into an loss chip right and now

323
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,050
the chips do allow us to emulate analog

324
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,790
stuff just by doing digital

325
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,930
representations of it

326
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,290

of those view clear cases that were made

373
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,000
on kik ok where the guy had to take the

374
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,679
Commodore name off because Commodore

375
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,230
went after important yeah so well that's

376

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,730
we called it the CR for cost reduce back

378
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,520
then so it became the C as an engineer

379
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,010
named Katayama did all the hydrating and

380
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,260

number of rings and all that I can

386
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,550
actually run in standalone mode to I

387
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,170

USB power or I have actually heard it up

389
