1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:04,830
bill heard from hackaday today we're

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,060
going to be talking about CMOS

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,980
electrical properties which includes the

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,269
voltages that we use in the

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:10,620
compatibility with some of the other

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,059
things we're going to be talking about

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,009
power dissipation which CMOS is known

8
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,839
for and it's what allows us to make

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,940
stuff very highly integrated can't

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,800
dissipate a lot of power in a in a

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,769
package full of stuff right and then

12
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,000
we're also going to be talking a little

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,650
bit about layout I actually want to show

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,269
you yes that's a wafer I actually want

15
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,939
to show you some how CMOS is actually

16
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,320
made I had the experience of working

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,030
with chip designers back at Commodore

18
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,250
and let me show you some of what they

19
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,460
taught me so it's the ground in a moment

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,070
I'm going to talk about what CMOS means

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,170
where those letters come from but first

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,390
let's review the family real quick CMOS

23
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,579
was best known for being low-power and

24
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,559
you know a lot of people are talking

25
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,570
about the TTL in the comments last time

26
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,579
about how it sold well CMOS is old to

27
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,670
the process some of the parts but

28
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,530
they've gotten better so the you know we

29
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,199
were known for low power but slow and

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,809
like the old CD 4000 series which are

31
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,459
still some good parts out there I don't

32
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,439
care what you say are some great parts

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,450
all right but you know you have to look

34
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,010
at the usage in what you use them for I

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,260
knew a guy that dumped a CD 4000 part

36
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,509
down an oil well to a couple hundred

37
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,909
degrees dur Aidid it for speed it went

38
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,799
very slow but it worked

39
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,439
it was linear extrapolation to

40
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,210
temperature versus feet can't do that

41
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,610
with a bipolar part for the most part so

42
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,880
nowadays they're low-power and fast CMOS

43
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,329
we're talking about um and if they're

44
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,189
low-power static meaning when they're

45
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,020
not moving they're very low-power that's

46
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,610
due to high impedance there's no current

47
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,560
going in the inputs of them and the

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,229
output is whatever they're driving to as

49
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,439
the speeds increase CMOS power increases

50
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,329
and I'm going to show you why the power

51
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,439
dissipation so and nowadays CMOS parts

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,350
have lots of output power in the early

53
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,060
days they they were little twiddle e

54
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,520
things and nowadays they can they can

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,770
produce an output current high and and

56
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,540
output current low that just rivals some

57
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,549
of the bipolar especially they can do a

58
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,020
better job of getting those equal if

59
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,628
it's if it's 64 milliamps up at 64

60
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,930
milliamps down so they're good parts let

61
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,830
me show you though

62
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,780
we talk about old versus new I'm going

63
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,090
to show you a graph here that one of the

64
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,700
vendors made that talks about the

65
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,860
advancement of CMOS here's an

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,630
interesting diagram I pulled from a TI

67
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,630
bulletin about one of their families and

68
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,420
it does show the rise and decline the

69
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,720
the bell curve here of the old parts the

70
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,240
TTL is the shot keys and some things in

71
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,680
the middle of the fast and the H sees

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,750
and then as we come around the curve and

73
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,060
we're getting into the the new stuff and

74
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,240
you do see the red is CMOS you do see

75
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,550
CMOS is kind of kind of mostly driving

76
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,470
the way into the low voltages low powers

77
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,360
is what drives a lot of these are small

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,270
devices these days but there is also

79
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,400
some bi CMOS which means it's a mix of

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,970
bipolar technology and CMOS technology

81
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,980
so kind of an interesting graph here of

82
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,570
course in this they're trying to show

83
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,730
you they're trying to sell you on a HC

84
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,430
as one of the families here's another

85
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,750
chart this one though it's an

86
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,840
interesting chart it shows the voltage

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,790
versus the speed of the C Mo's families

88
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,380
and you really can't get a feel for the

89
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,239
progression you know starting with the

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,250
old high speed CMOS which was you know

91
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,910
couldn't starting to replace CD 4000s

92
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,980
which aren't shown on this chart and as

93
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,300
they progressed through the family we

94
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,370
see we also progress through the

95
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,260
voltages down into the lower voltages

96
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,570
but that we also progress getting faster

97
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,940
and faster now what's not shown on here

98
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,430
is the old CD 4000 family which was one

99
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,580
of the first and it could go to 15 volts

100
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,459
so it actually had used as I helped Alka

101
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,830
with one of his old synthesizers the

102
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,840
other day and everything was running off

103
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,670
10 and 15 volts I'll not say Headroom

104
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,980
for noise right so here's something you

105
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,290
can't do you know is run at 15 volts we

106
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,840
don't see that a lot these days

107
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,150
alright CMOS means complementary

108
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,670
metal-oxide-semiconductor and the

109
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,260
complementary part means we're going to

110
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,060
use both P and N channel devices which

111
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,920
simply means we can pull up and down

112
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,950
equally but MLS

113
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,850
metal-oxide-semiconductor is actually

114
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,160
short for MOSFET

115
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,169
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect

116
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,269
transistor so let's start with those I

117
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,620
want to show you the various kinds and

118
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,060
then we're going to build forward into

119
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,250
how C CMOS evolved in and why it's

120
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,910
useful today

121
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,850
okay MOSFET not all oxide semiconductor

122
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,600
field

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,870
transistor before I jump into that you

124
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,340
may have heard of a junction fet well in

125
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,960
that case the gate which acts like the

126
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,520
base in a transistor if you want to

127
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,740
think of it that way the controlling pin

128
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,960
actually touches the rest of the device

129
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,030
hence the word junction fet has a lot of

130
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,490
uses they're kind of rugged and but the

131
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,870
current here joins with the other

132
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,640
currents it's not as high impedance

133
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,500
higher higher impedance than some but

134
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,860
not a true MOSFET a MOSFET metal oxide

135
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,590
the oxide it means insulator it means

136
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,870
silicon oxide in this case other oxides

137
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,910
are good insulator too but in this case

138
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,860
silicon oxide and that's this air gap

139
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,570
here and if that looks like a capacitor

140
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,060
I'll tell you that's a capacitor with

141
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,100
that said this is a voltage device at

142
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,000
this point this puts a voltage field on

143
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,400
to the rest of the device and it will

144
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,190
either turn off the device in the case

145
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,380
of depletion mode it depletes the signal

146
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,680
flow deplete or it enhances the signal

147
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,230
flow and turns the device on and again

148
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,820
with only a gate voltage applied will

149
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,280
this turn on so this is like a normally

150
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,870
closed switch and this is like a

151
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,730
normally open switch if you want to

152
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,910
think of it that way I do so there's two

153
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,890
polarities two of these also so we've

154
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,210
got a total of four depletion

155
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,640
enhancement in channel P channel the N

156
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,620
channel MOSFET and I've showed

157
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,120
enhancement here because I think they're

158
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,540
by far more common this is really good

159
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,330
at pulling down and we see the way to

160
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,100
recognize as when you see the two legs

161
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,690
down that's the direction that it's good

162
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,510
at and so in channel devices or even in

163
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,670
moss we're good at pulling down and P

164
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,490
channel devices are good at pulling up

165
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,430
CMOS complementary Moss is where we use

166
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,080
both of these so that we're equally good

167
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,900
at pulling down and up here I've hooked

168
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,180
those two devices together the N channel

169
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,100
pulling down the P channel pulling up

170
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,080
and ran them to a signal and this is a

171
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,810
simple inverter if when the signal goes

172
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,140
high it will turn on this device pulling

173
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,600
it low when the signal goes low the

174
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,910
input it will turn on this device so

175
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,800
another way we can draw it that's

176
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,860
actually helpful to remember is we can

177
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,450
draw it with the actual bubble here on

178
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,460
the P Mo's device so when it's low it's

179
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,500
active and when this high this is active

180
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,860
one

181
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,229
way to remember if if it's an active low

182
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,110
or if a part has a bubble is if we were

183
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,819
to put a bubble on this one this arrow

184
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,259
would be in the direction of the bubble

185
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,870
and pop it so if we can put a bubble

186
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,879
here no problem no bubble belongs here

187
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,639
this is an act of hide okay real quick I

188
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,169
want to just show how to make a NAND

189
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:00,689
gate a not and gate and it's how you

190
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,610
hook the devices together so quite

191
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,069
simply when this is high and this is

192
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:06,990
high both of these will be all high

193
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,030
they're in series something you can do

194
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,909
with the CMOS stuff and that's when both

195
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,860
of these will be turned on and pulled to

196
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,650
low any other combination has at least

197
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,009
one of these low turns on the pull-up

198
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,229
and any other combination that doesn't

199
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:23,849
have bowtie doesn't so there's no

200
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,740
conflict when you look at it so now that

201
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,620
we know that this is a voltage device

202
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,169
that CMOS doesn't allow much current a

203
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,360
little leakage but not much current that

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,860
means that this is high impedance

205
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,900
there's no impedance to load down the

206
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,699
source voltage such as if your finger

207
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,110
touched the resistor to ground there'd

208
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,300
be no appreciable voltage on your finger

209
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,550
but if you were to touch CMOS as high

210
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,250
input impedance with a finger and Scott

211
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,110
static on it you just get tremendous

212
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,300
voltage can be applied to this device

213
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,370
you know punch holes right in this very

214
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,050
thin oxide is one of the failure

215
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,940
mechanisms or another one he'll splatter

216
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,580
when it does that so I end up with stuff

217
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,110
all over the inside of the chip and it's

218
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,909
just a matter of time before it then

219
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,240
fails due to usually a heat mechanism so

220
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,339
what we end up having to do or is put

221
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:10,740
diodes on here to protect the input so

222
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,569
that the input in theory can't go above

223
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,370
this voltage or below this voltage now

224
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,389
of course it takes a while for that

225
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:17,339
diode to turn on and a lot of times

226
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,960
these are actually Fe T's these days

227
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,810
that perform the diode function we used

228
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,180
to get all the time something called SCR

229
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,400
lajiye met silicon controlled rectifier

230
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,770
latch up now it's in the days of s ers

231
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,449
and thyristors which is how we made our

232
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,820
cool light organs blink to the music and

233
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,899
stuff and quite simply it's not simple

234
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,839
there is a a P and n of P and an

235
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,849
injunction formed by the way all of

236
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,708
these things come together that wouldn't

237
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,449
happen if you were doing either just in

238
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,699
moss or P MOS alone it's because we have

239
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,010
to flip the polarity some some things

240
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,600
and we'll talk about what an n-well is

241
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,329
here in a bit you end up with something

242
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:54,880
looks like this

243
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,069
I've used to draw it like this when I

244
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,130
was younger and in the way I visualized

245
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,019
a Nessie are turning on was this tunnels

246
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,910
to where it's only an N and a P Junction

247
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,470
and the current swiping through that

248
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,699
well in the reality it's a pair of

249
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:08,920
transistors back to back and the way

250
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,839
these combine you get a resistive effect

251
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,759
which turns on it's a cascade effect

252
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,709
transistor turns on which turns on the

253
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:15,670
other transistor and pretty soon

254
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,470
everybody's turned on and we used to

255
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,630
have to remove power for 10 seconds or

256
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,240
so to let this undo you don't let it

257
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,910
unlatch and you think you'd blown the

258
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,230
heck out of whatever you're working on

259
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,940
sometimes you had but sometimes you

260
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,290
could turn it off let it sit and it

261
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,569
would turn back on otherwise it'd just

262
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,660
be dead right all right let's talk about

263
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,449
TTL voltages versus see most voltages

264
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:39,940
let's let's have that conversation now I

265
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,769
want to go fast enough that this isn't

266
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,230
too boring but I don't want to go so

267
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,389
fast that I just lead too many facts

268
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,490
missing so but bear with me here

269
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,949
so real quick the old TTL if you

270
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,569
remember we had a lot of headroom here

271
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,459
we get to 2 point 4 volts and we throw

272
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,459
the rest of this away well in 5 volts

273
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,529
CMOS that's not the case that you split

274
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,569
it in half and that's your threshold the

275
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:03,730
upper two-thirds around that area is

276
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,620
where you know it's said hey I'll

277
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,360
produce at least this much I need at

278
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,550
least this much on my input same on the

279
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,350
lower end so you'll see it's kind of a

280
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,569
nice linear spread and that actually

281
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,250
carries out through the lower voltages

282
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,410
except for the TI logic guide that did

283
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,029
this and i recolored it so it looked

284
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:21,370
good to us they blow it see there's a

285
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,560
zero in here when there shouldn't be so

286
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,810
looking at this then you can see that if

287
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,089
you drive CMOS into TTL provided you

288
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:29,589
have enough current capability in these

289
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,480
days CMOS has a lot of current

290
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,180
capability the output high is well above

291
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,579
what we need in the output low is really

292
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,829
really close to what we need right so

293
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:41,199
there you generally wasn't a problem

294
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,360
if in doubt check for yourself however

295
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,149
going from TTL to CMOS you'll see says

296
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm only going to guarantee you this

297
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,610
high and he says well I need at least

298
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,670
this I so you can use a pull-up resistor

299
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,079
I may show it later in the video just

300
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,250
show a little picture of a pull-up

301
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,670
resistor on a gate but if you do the

302
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,990
math and make sure that the pull up

303
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,790
resistor doesn't break any rules over

304
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,290
heat anything provides enough current

305
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,589
the meantime you can translate from TTL

306
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,439
to CMOS told you I'd show you a TTL gate

307
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:08,780
with

308
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,820
pull up on it this actually works a lot

309
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,440
at the time I'm just not saying all the

310
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,420
time because you should do the math and

311
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,890
you might find an instance where it

312
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,750
doesn't but normally if you have like a

313
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,850
high-speed CMOS advanced high-speed CMOS

314
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,240
a video CMOS etc you put a pull-up on

315
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,010
here and it'll make your V input law or

316
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,340
V input high or you could use a T

317
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,020
version when you see the T on the end

318
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,630
sometimes there's T's in the middle like

319
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,510
a high speed CMOS TTL compatible input

320
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,210
same thing here and here you don't need

321
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,030
to pull up and the input thresholds have

322
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,360
been to actually be compatible a

323
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,620
lot of these get used so this is

324
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,720
typically how you do a TTL to CMOS word

325
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,150
the voltages or otherwise the same I'm
