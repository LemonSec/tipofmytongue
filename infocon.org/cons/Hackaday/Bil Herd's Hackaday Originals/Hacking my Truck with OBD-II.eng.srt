2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,859
they'll heard from hackaday today I'm

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,799
going to be hacking the OBD port on my

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,070
late-model SUV just kinda for the heck

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,650
of it as I said I'm going to be hacking

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,529
away at the OBD port in my car here

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,980
today and I'll probably say ODB at least

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,039
one time during a load EDC or some but

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,789
onboard diagnostic obd now that's that

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,920
funny little connector that's up under

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,960
your dashboard as a matter of fact when

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,149
my older cars failed they changed the

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,340
laws here in New Jersey I take it in

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,930
they couldn't get to the plug like

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,640
getting a straight shot at it and they

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
failed me for emissions because they

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,870
couldn't plug in so now everything they

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,879
want to know about my car I get from the

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,410
onboard diagnostic OBD port now this

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,000
here is like a little wireless dongle

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,219
that you can get to plug in these are

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,960
real popular these days you have your

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,539
own scan tools that allow you to plug in

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,989
and learn what's going on in your car

25
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,960
but I had a different thing in mind what

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,049
happened was I had installed a usable

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,020
GPS into my late-model Ford Explorer and

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,750
so that silly Microsoft thing kept using

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,250
my cell phone asked where the heck it

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,040
was just horrible thing so I stick it in

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,409
and I get a harness adapter and I've

32
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,720
done this dozens of times but this time

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,170
the VSS signal the video speed sensor

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,450
signal was not present in the harness I

35
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,549
didn't notice right away right time but

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,470
I noticed when my GPS would show me

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,360
driving about forty yards to the right

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
of the actual highway and things and

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,259
what happens is the GPS is a combination

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,180
of asking the satellites from time to

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,000
time but also knowing the speed of your

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,329
car and so it can do some dead reckoning

43
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:47,070
especially the satellite signal is weak

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,180
or whatever so I go to look for the VSS

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,740
signal and I've had to track these down

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,090
before this is just common alright you

47
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,490
can get it you know it's usually in the

48
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,409
car somewhere it hangs off the

49
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,869
transmission sometimes at the cable I

50
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,969
mean the sensors Hall effect sensor

51
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,250
something and they day sometimes they

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,410
hang off the wheels for the speed but

53
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,630
that's kind of for the

54
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,910
the breaking what I don't want to get I

55
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,060
own terrified that a microprocessor is

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,620
in charge of the brakes of my car anyway

57
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,210
you slide alone messing with that wire

58
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,390
and what I found was I couldn't find the

59
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,980
VSS wire i alternate li rented the

60
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,080
schematics directly from Ford for three

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,320
days dug deep into it found that the VSS

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,330
wire indeed does not come anywhere near

63
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,280
the dashboard it's not underneath the

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,560
kick panel where it used to be on some

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,490
other cars and in fact the finally the

66
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,980
place I found it was where they had a

67
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,200
wire say knew how fast to make the

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,260
windshield wipers go silly reads only

69
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,960
but only digital version of the VSS wire

70
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,930
in my fork in in the past it used to use

71
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,520
them so you knew how loud to make the

72
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,990
radio but they I guess they quit doing

73
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,760
that or that's a GM thing or something

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,090
so what I wanted to do is make a small

75
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,100
circuit board and this is just an insane

76
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,960
little thing if you see the way I did it

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,590
I'll show you here in a second that

78
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,780
takes that reads the OBD port so you

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,730
plug it in leave it in and creates a

80
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,240
speed pulse for a GPS so big ole

81
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,540
elephant dragging a mouse right so I

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,920
want to show you how I did that and

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,690
talked a little bit about the obd part

84
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,050
of obd onboard diagnostic protocol and

85
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,750
you know some of the things I learned

86
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,720
while playing with this now here's my

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,580
first pass at a board that does what I

88
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,260
was talking about which would interface

89
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,400
to the OBD port in my car and create a

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,710
pulse basically you know you'll see I

91
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,840
did a really crazy thing I'm using

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,150
surface mount for the chips because of

93
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,960
the available the available space here

94
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,750
and then I still used actual

95
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,300
through-hole resistors and stood them up

96
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,100
on end like the old transistor radios

97
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,440
that just simply because I hate hand

98
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,800
soldering tons of SMT resistors so you

99
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,690
don't take up too much room and I did

100
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,060
get it to fit but but this was a

101
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,550
full-blown does all the different

102
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,220
versions I so enjoy 1850 and stuff and

103
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm going to change that I think so on

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,800
board we have a basically a UART four

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,250
obd made by a made by obd solution

106
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,100
strangely enough but it's called the stn

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,600
one one one zero

108
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,900
the 1110 and basically it takes care of

109
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,700
it I'm going to show the schematic here

110
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,410
but it takes care of kind of the

111
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,020
protocols for you and then I threw on an

112
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,620
80 mega 3:28 like in your Arduino ish

113
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,140
type things so it sits on the board and

114
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,540
notin so basically what I've done is

115
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,460
emulated taking an Arduino and a can

116
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,770
shield right and this is made by seed

117
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,540
studio and you can do that if you want

118
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,130
but I wanted mine to fit in a little box

119
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,320
so I kind of jumped in and made my own

120
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,590
little thing right here's the view of

121
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,630
the PC board I made for this video

122
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,630
inside my CAD package now I toyed with

123
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,990
the idea of doing yellow with black silk

124
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,940
screen and two things one what if it

125
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,100
looks like crap on the video yeah I just

126
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,880
I couldn't risk it and second I use PCB

127
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,460
way overseas for my boards these cost me

128
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,830
a buck each and I get them you know

129
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,200
within a week except for black silk

130
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,940
screen raised the price to like two and

131
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,310
a half bucks each so I went back to my

132
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,900
normal blue and white so here I am if my

133
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,150
normal colors and you can see like I

134
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,750
said I I did this crazy thing of

135
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,580
standing the resistors but you know once

136
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,680
I started trying to make it fit I just

137
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,560
got lost in trying to make it fit so but

138
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,780
here's what the schematic looks like and

139
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,050
I'll tell you never ever do this okay

140
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,510
don't cram all the stuff on one page but

141
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,990
with that said do as I say not as I do

142
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,060
again I get so involved with just trying

143
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,800
to make it fit so I have a processor

144
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,290
page with the static protection for uh I

145
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,390
say you should say surge protection and

146
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,729
the regular page but there's too much

147
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,440
here to try and show you so I'm going to

148
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,900
break it down further I mean show you in

149
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:23,160
one page here's the main part the stn 11

150
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,360
10 that I spoke about

151
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,760
and again this acts like a UART to

152
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,669
convert all the protocols into just a

153
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:33,419
UART it's not like setting registers and

154
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,280
having to learn in this case the can

155
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,580
protocol or the ISO protocols or

156
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,540
anything

157
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,220
pretty much does that for you given that

158
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,070
you know how to query out using an ATC

159
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,490
type command set like the elm327 I think

160
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,190
is the super subset of it and it

161
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,750
actually acts kind of like a modem in

162
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,040
some ways so here's here's that part and

163
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,450
you know it's available in a surface

164
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,380
mount or a dip and again it takes care

165
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,940
of old stuff this thing costs like

166
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,450
eleven dollars so you're paying for the

167
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,770
software on this now the can shield I

168
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,390
called you I don't know why they call it

169
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,830
a ship we call them daughter cards

170
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,520
people my age and probably shows our age

171
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,930
but the you could go with the standalone

172
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,970
can controller that's what's on the

173
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,280
shield but I'll tell you what you got to

174
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,530
learn something about can protocol

175
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,660
you've got to learn about extended data

176
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,150
frames I think and then at the end of

177
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,640
the day nothing says that's the OBD

178
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,280
represent a version of the protocol it

179
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,470
scan protocol and what I first heard of

180
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,160
came back in the late 70s early 80s for

181
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,400
uh for automation in the factory

182
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,440
manufacturing automation so been around

183
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,690
a while but I just want to talk this

184
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,370
thing like a UART I'm going to get this

185
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,380
project rolling along get a video made

186
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,530
out of it so I stuck with the stn 1110

187
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,400
so let me show you this in a schematic

188
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,380
where where you can see it so to go

189
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,330
through the board schematic in a little

190
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,420
bit more detail remember that obd is

191
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,290
several different protocols not per car

192
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,900
but the plug has to support it depending

193
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,490
on what kind of car you're plugging into

194
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,020
you're going to be plugging into in this

195
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,380
case you see Ford uses Ford modern-day

196
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,470
Ford uses K and high-speed but it used

197
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,980
to use one of the one of the ISOs and so

198
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,059
I'm sorry one the J 1850s remember that

199
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,630
we have J 1850 variable pulse which 1850

200
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,940
pulse width modulation variable pulse

201
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,849
width the actual frequency will change

202
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:44,430
with pulse width modulation only the

203
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,680
ratio of highest to load change but

204
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,310
there's more involved for J 1850 pulse

205
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,260
width modulation the main thing they see

206
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,070
is that

207
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,130
based on five volts and if we look at

208
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,080
variable pulse width it's a seven volt

209
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,670
creature yay so right off the bat one of

210
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,620
the things I want to show you is that's

211
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,050
the way we deal with the 5-7 volt the

212
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,090
defied the seven volt need is there is a

213
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,130
control line that indicates when it's

214
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,750
and pulse width modulation mode or

215
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,600
variable pulse width and that changes

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,900
the 5/7 volt signal to be your powers

217
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,840
power rail to be either 5 or 7 and it

218
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,490
does this by changing the ratio of these

219
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,330
reference resistances on an LM one one

220
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,210
seven of adjustable voltage regulator

221
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,700
similar to the low dropouts four five

222
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,100
and three except this one is not preset

223
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,140
to a voltage it uses these ratios and

224
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,680
basically you count on this resistance

225
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,020
here to be almost zero when it's on and

226
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,360
when it's off you'll see this 240 volts

227
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,620
or 240 ohm here we see the J 1850 in

228
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,480
their interface and one thing I'll say

229
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,960
is all of this stuff needs heavy surge

230
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,690
protection the automobile is a horrible

231
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,090
place for power surges you have huge

232
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,280
inductors right starter motors all those

233
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,710
we call load dumping so I'm not showing

234
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,330
a lot of that right now you might see it

235
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,220
later just attacked on the schematics

236
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,780
but if you were going to production with

237
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,180
this is a big part of what you can't

238
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,370
ignore is how to protect all this from

239
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,380
the environment it's in also automotive

240
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,090
temperature ranges are just horrible

241
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,030
right minus 40 degrees hot car was that

242
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,760
iron 2130 leave it in your window right

243
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,930
melt so here's the J 1850 though and you

244
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,930
can see that you know the transmitter is

245
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,900
if sets basically it's got a low and a

246
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,460
high and this sets the correct

247
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,100
references and then for the receiver we

248
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,720
end up with two halves of an op-amp

249
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,340
which basically just different

250
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,870
thresholds that's that's pretty much

251
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,880
what's going on here and then these

252
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,930
again go into the 1110 and it turns it

253
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,410
into a York signal into ASCII for you I

254
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,750
so 91 42 is has a basically when you see

255
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,790
a K in an L line that's that's the

256
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,550
signals involved in this it's a 12-volt

257
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,310
based protocol and as it says this is

258
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,870
Chrysler European or Age

259
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,200
vehicles again up to about 2008 here's

260
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,570
the interface for that just pull downs

261
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,980
and actually the speed of these

262
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,500
important I have a feeling I'd have to

263
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,810
check the speeds on the 22 22s by the

264
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,310
way I grabbed most of this right out of

265
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,620
the application notes for the parts -

266
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,960
people make these parts no more than I

267
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,850
do at the moment if I was a production

268
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,370
design for production you better believe

269
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,029
I would tear into these to the minutia

270
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,430
right because that's that's how you make

271
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,380
things work in production here's the

272
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,680
transmitter is your basic common emitter

273
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,240
output and then it uses a op amp with

274
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,270
again a preset threshold here as a

275
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,339
comparator I'm sorry this is compared

276
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,990
I've been called an op amp which often

277
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,960
comparators are op amps but lm339 is an

278
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,760
open collector version that's very good

279
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,220
at what it does and so this is the third

280
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,029
part of the LM 3 339 and this is the ISO

281
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,680
91 41 protocol and then we have cam and

282
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,410
I haven't been showing you the speeds

283
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,110
but KN is the fastest they you could see

284
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,580
the speech but now now we're into the

285
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,540
high speed stuff this is since 2008 and

286
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,850
we find that it's got a voltage the high

287
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,100
and lows so it's all below 5 but the

288
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,459
high it welds 4.5 as we see here and the

289
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,310
high and lows are 3.5 and 1.5 volts you

290
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,290
will not build your own key and

291
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,600
transceiver most of the time you will

292
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,830
use one here's the can transceiver I'm

293
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,070
using um if I go completely if I make a

294
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,020
version that's just canned based

295
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,820
I'll probably go back to making

296
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,589
everything through hold maybe I can make

297
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:47,970
it a kit throw it up onto Indy or

298
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,130
something but this is a canned

299
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,380
transceiver not to be confused with a

300
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,529
can controller right this is a whole

301
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,990
processor thing or I'm sorry this meant

302
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,910
an Augmented processor like they show a

303
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,490
lot of pic variants and it speaks SPI

304
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,660
this is just the correct electrical

305
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,140
interface to the car now again I'll

306
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,080
throw in my things as es des des D you

307
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,970
need to protect these devices from all

308
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,890
the crazy voltages you'll find in your

309
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,770
car and let alone that you write strange

310
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,610
commands to your

311
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,769
Caron caused it to fall out do that kind

312
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,390
of thing now I've been talking way too

313
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,920
much just showing you the hardware

314
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,240
involved so I actually want to show you

315
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,579
this working I'll cover more about the

316
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,060
actual obd codes that you need PIDs

317
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,940
parameter ID that we send a request

318
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,310
information an OB D bus doesn't just

319
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,800
stream information you ask it things in

320
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,019
the ECU or actually transmission might

321
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,269
respond and then there's a diagnostic

322
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:47,339
trouble code at DTC and that is that

323
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,040
does originated from the obd bus tell

324
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,300
you its problem that your check engine

325
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,190
light usually means there's a dtc

326
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,380
waiting to be picked up but first i just

327
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,180
want to show you remember i want to go

328
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,670
get the speed of my car so i can vary a

329
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,310
pulse with very simple right well first

330
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,459
we need a car well doesn't fit in here

331
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,810
right plus you're not going to go out

332
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,940
and really work on your car outside and

333
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,860
hook strange hardware to it without

334
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,800
knowing at least works so I have here a

335
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,260
obd simulator stimulator whatever you

336
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,390
want to call it or Dax like a car I got

337
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,959
this one cheap off eBay for like 70

338
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
bucks or something you can buy these in

339
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,490
the States could good ones from no

340
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,050
manufacturers there are a couple hundred

341
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,550
bucks if you're doing serious work

342
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,170
that's what I do but I'm making a video

343
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,310
here so if we look at our obd stimulator

344
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,070
here simulator says sim right here you

345
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,980
see we can pick today all kinds of them

346
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,740
right now set mind set for iso 91 41

347
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,870
we'll see if that works and then here

348
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,089
are potentiometers that represent the

349
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:53,100
different things about your car remember

350
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,890
i was interested in the speed of the car

351
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,010
and if i turn this the speed actually in

352
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,490
shown in kilometers an hour will vary

353
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,529
okay now what I just noticed here a bit

354
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,140
ago is there's actually the PID written

355
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,010
below at 0 1 0 D so what I want to do is

356
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,000
ask this device here about 0 1 0 D and

357
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,890
it should come back with a speed between

358
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,510
0 and 2 and 255 kilometers per hour here

359
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,760
I've got my simulator plugged into a

360
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,860
development board and it's made by obd

361
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,079
solutions same people that made the chip

362
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,240
that's on here in fact here's the chip

363
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,449
this is the 1110 hit this is an 1170

364
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:34,380
it's a cousin to

365
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,330
here's all the driver stuff that's all

366
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,940
over my board here and this processor

367
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,050
that I'm just showing here because I

368
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,330
lost my hackaday pro trinket while I was

369
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,330
shooting here so I pulled this one out

370
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,560
represents the processor that's down

371
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,420
here but what makes this good for

372
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,710
shooting here today is it's got a

373
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,130
built-in USB to serial adapter and let's

374
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,870
see if we can pull the speed out of this

375
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,450
thing here on the Left I've got my

376
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,240
terminal program hooked to the virtual

377
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,680
comport on com6

378
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,650
and it's got the reset message I will

379
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,630
warn you this has kind of the standard

380
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,060
old problem of carriage returns and line

381
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,760
feeds not kind of mapping each other but

382
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,790
when I give it an ATV just like it will

383
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,830
note them it gives me back my message

384
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,140
now remember this is all about getting

385
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,110
the value for 0 1 0 D which is right

386
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,230
here and that is the speed right next to

387
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,870
it C rpm actually 0 1 0 C but let's go

388
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:34,550
ahead and ask for the current speed and

389
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,930
what it's done is it's overwritten

390
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,720
itself but it replied with 41 0 D and

391
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,230
then B 5 which happens to be 181 I

392
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,820
looked it up ahead of time and sure

393
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,400
enough on the speed here it's up for 181

394
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,060
km/h if we go ahead and change the speed

395
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:04,650
and ask it again now we get a DD so all

396
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,220
this to get that little value to pop out

397
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,630
of the OBD bus of your car so as you saw

398
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,720
I was able to extract the the speed as a

399
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,720
bite without non-kin protocol anything

400
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,939
like that just a little bit of ASCII and

401
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,040
that's why I did it that way again

402
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,170
designing for production IBEW well I'd

403
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,550
want to do it the cheapest way which

404
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,439
means you invest more upfront in your

405
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,380
design and less and using other people's

406
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,120
expensive stuff but that's a cool little

407
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,660
chip in my book so next time I'll be

408
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,240
working back on this thing here again of

409
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,910
doing the software for it and I'm going

410
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,470
to probably treat this more like a

411
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,990
real-time operating system meaning I

412
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,520
want to use I don't want to sit in

413
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,030
Assyria

414
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,920
Loup i won when you use the counters and

415
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,840
timers to create those pulse widths and

416
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,090
and do so in a way where it's rooted in

417
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,740
you know relates to the crystal

418
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,010
frequency right real time I'm a hardware

419
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,940
guy right

420
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,550
I like in-circuit emulator and hopefully

421
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,440
I designed this sucker good enough that

422
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,470
I can actually in circuit emulate and

423
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,390
not just do a bunch of printf because

424
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm a lousy programmer I like in-circuit

425
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,860
emulator 'sons so that I should be able

426
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,380
on this one I think I use the debug wire

427
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,160
pin so bill heard from hackaday uh part

428
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,650
one of two parts of obd this being the

429
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,150
hardware stuff next time we'll do a

430
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,160
little bit of software for creating our

431
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,820
pulses so that we can drive a GPS off

432
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,760
our obd bus so still heard from hackaday

433
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,960
and we'll catch you on the next part

434
00:18:34,960 --> 00:19:20,319
