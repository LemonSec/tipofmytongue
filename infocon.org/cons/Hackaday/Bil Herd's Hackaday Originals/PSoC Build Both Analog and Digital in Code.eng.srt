00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,450
hi bill heard from hackaday today we're

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,589
going to be looking at this little

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,380
development board called a pioneer for

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,380
features a peace Hawk for chip which is

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,839
a programmable system on chip and it

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,520
features not just digital like we're

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
used to but it features also analogues

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
such as op-amps ad converters MUX is

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,820
audio muck or analog muxes and so you

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,830
can change the gain on your op amp by

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,390
bringing it out to some resistors that

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,380
kind of thing

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,739
so what I like about first off I love

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,329
development boards because you can get

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,829
up and running right away without having

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,079
to make a mistake on your first PC board

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,020
it's not like I've done that but also

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,450
then because I can include a certain

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,280
number of analog parts including things

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,219
like watchdog and stuff that means I can

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,870
put the whole design on here and not

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,730
have to build something on a solderless

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,800
breadboard or later when I want to use

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,480
it again rebuild what was on the

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,520
solderless breadboard it so I can not

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,280
download everything in one shot so it

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,700
does also fit our do we know ish shields

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,939
and so we'll see what all we can do here

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,409
today we're just going to go through all

30
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,900
the steps real quick to program it so

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,790
that you see one of everything and just

32
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,700
know it's there and in future videos

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,189
hopefully we'll build something actually

34
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,689
kind of intricate or interesting at

35
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,970
least so again Bill heard from hackaday

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,960
and let's see what we can do with this

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,759
okay so here's the pioneer for

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,530
development board with the piece for the

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,590
piece hawk for years this shows the

40
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,840
alignment of how a an Ethernet shield

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,049
would go an Arduino shield if we were to

42
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,750
put one on there also here is the piece

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,720
hawk for itself and then this piece hawk

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,960
this is AP Sauk 5 and it's used to act

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,950
as the bootloader

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,409
take care of the programming and some

47
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,689
other housekeeping and it's kind of

48
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,909
common these days on developer boards to

49
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,560
see a second device in there assisting

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,320
so the first device connect more native

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,509
but still be able to load code and do

52
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,729
some other things okay I did want to

53
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,399
show you the integrated development

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,550
environment here

55
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,310
real quick before we actually take and

56
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,440
burn our own part our own sample design

57
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,480
here just to show all the pieces from

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,600
beginning to end but there's too much to

59
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,070
show but there's some cool things I want

60
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,930
to show you here real quick so here in

61
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,750
the center is our content this gets

62
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,790
pushed or pulled by the vendor what I

63
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,380
like about it is we do have the app

64
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,120
notes and the data sheets in a handy

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,490
place so I do appreciate that often the

66
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,770
left we have our design files these are

67
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,640
both schematics and maintenance EAH

68
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,220
living together which demonstrates you

69
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,840
know the fact that we've got software

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,030
and hardware under our design here and

71
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,300
there is even some of the modules you

72
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,910
can implement as hardware or as software

73
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,850
or a mixture of both so it's truly a

74
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,880
hybrid type thing we got going here if I

75
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,610
were to show you the examples real quick

76
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,970
let's see if I can bring that up for you

77
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,310
here we go and is if you if you were to

78
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,140
look through here there's a lot of

79
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,989
different kinds of product projects that

80
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,420
you can start and so if we do take a

81
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,440
look here at the schematic here's a

82
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,330
schematic like you might see with the

83
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,330
exception that you know that this is

84
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,570
going in a chip and it's got analog you

85
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,850
know so I can bring in parts I can hook

86
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,550
them up I can scale gains here here I

87
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,550
can connect external parts and set gains

88
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,250
as you see here so and here's a MUX so

89
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,470
this is a remote controlled gain device

90
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,950
right so that's that's pretty cool if we

91
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,380
take a look over here then on the right

92
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,410
we can take a look and I don't know if

93
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,170
you can see all that but I wanted to

94
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,940
show you just some of the kinds of parts

95
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,060
of op amps comparators dax digital

96
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,610
analog converters I squared see we've

97
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,410
got digital functions you are it's

98
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,890
quadrature decoders PWM all kinds of

99
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,920
flops flips registers character displays

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,170
pin and then we've got system things

101
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,900
like clock and bootloader and interrupt

102
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,380
management under tools here we do have a

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,640
DMA wizard that guides you through

104
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,290
making a DMA

105
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,440
paddleball device I I kind of I look

106
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,150
forward to trying that because that that

107
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,910
sounds very cool so but this is in a

108
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,880
nutshell this is the IDE so let's go

109
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,350
over back over to the bench

110
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,830
and let's burn apart here real quick all

111
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,990
right setup is extremely easy as you

112
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,700
might expect Wells we need is our

113
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,500
development board which plugs into the

114
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,780
USB cable that came with it and I've

115
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,520
already pre-loaded the software on the

116
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,160
computer so got our monitor down get our

117
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,020
keyboard out and that's it we're ready

118
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,890
to go okay here's our top design I chose

119
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,610
now I got this off of Newark element14

120
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,060
they had a they had a promo of a hundred

121
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,580
circuits and a hundred days using the P

122
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,850
sock for the the Pioneer 4 board here

123
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,070
and so I grabbed number two in the list

124
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,810
and it's just an example of the

125
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,030
capacitive slider that's built into this

126
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,970
and it's just going to make the color of

127
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,520
the light of the LED change so here

128
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,860
here's one of these devices that doesn't

129
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,720
have any visible pins but I'm sure it's

130
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,520
plugged into the firmware into the

131
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,230
assignments there and so the values are

132
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,380
coming in this is probably half half

133
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,410
code and a little bit of hardware here

134
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,840
so here's our two LEDs and here's our

135
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,500
captions and when we're ready we're

136
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,880
going to go ahead and do a clean and

137
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,370
build okay right now it's doing a

138
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,300
fitting I know that because I see the

139
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,740
word fit in the name it's a couple

140
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,660
minutes later and the design is done

141
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,350
it's been compiled and then it's been

142
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,770
fitted into the programmable part of

143
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,470
this device here's our schematic again

144
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,280
but if we go to two resources with these

145
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,500
are the pin assignments as we talk but

146
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,990
then you can also see the analog usage

147
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,900
and some are things how the clocks play

148
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,810
out and in some other things and again

149
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,420
real common with all the FPGA s we have

150
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,090
our clocks pages and all those things

151
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,950
only there we're dealing with real small

152
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,160
clock sometimes real fast clocks so the

153
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
only thing

154
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,430
next is to see this thing in operation

155
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,530
so here's the compiled and uploaded

156
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,760
version and what it does is as we put

157
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,180
our finger on the slider it's changing

158
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,210
it from green to red back to green I

159
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,130
realize that the camera may not really

160
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,410
do that justice because that's a pretty

161
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,380
deep red and a pretty bright green right

162
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,740
now so on and it keeps the last color

163
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,010
you touch that's it for this video I

164
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,180
want to do another one where we actually

165
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,180
do a design and show you in more detail

166
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,250
all of the steps because again they're

167
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,880
useful almost in any IDE you use there

168
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,710
there'll be something similar to one of

169
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,620
the steps that we'll use in this IDE so

170
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,730
and and hopefully there's you can see

171
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,340
how how we can widen our toolbox and

172
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,190
have different answers to the same to

173
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,410
the same problem in this case we can

174
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,140
reuse code you know the C code we can

175
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,980
fit a shield to it it's it's you know

176
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,930
the same processor only different and

177
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,020
how many times have you done a one of

178
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,270
these small designs you see I got a glue

179
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,250
on a power supply two op amps and a

180
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,010
couple filters or you're doing it on a

181
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,020
solderless breadboard and when you're

182
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,480
done you just what do you do you take

183
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,520
the breadboard apart because you know

184
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,830
there's no longevity to it here you can

185
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,050
store a design on your disk and come

186
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,580
back to it and pull it out and the

187
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,680
comparators come online or the analog to

188
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,860
digital converters and whatnot so yeah

189
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,040
I'm just looking at doing a fan speed

190
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,500
controller with temperature probes for

191
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,810
our next project on this and if we go

192
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,030
that way I'm sure we'll be very detailed

193
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,660
so as I said that's it for this time if

194
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,400
there are any questions feel free to

195
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,429
post or to email me you know maybe I'll

196
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,919
build it into an the next video or

197
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,750
answer directly to it depend on what it

198
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,929
is and with that said Bill heard from

199
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,939
hackaday keep on hacking
