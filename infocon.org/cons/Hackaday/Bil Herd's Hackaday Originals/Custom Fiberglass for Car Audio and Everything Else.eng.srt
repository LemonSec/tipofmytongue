1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,980
Dillard from a kadhi today we're back in

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,529
the garage doing custom fiberglass

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:09,630
what's custom fiberglass well it's a way

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,540
to make a mess let me tell you and it's

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,059
a permanent mess it's a great mess so no

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,270
I it's when I work on my own cars or

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,250
sometimes just need something done I'll

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,420
go and make a speaker pod or a subwoofer

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,609
enclosure you've seen probably in custom

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,130
cars I just happen to like to do my own

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,539
I'm going to show you how to do a simple

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,308
one today a couple of quick examples

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,350
that I'm not saying I do the best in the

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,969
world I tend to get bored long before

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,770
the job's done but this is a subwoofer

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,579
panel in my custom one I get in my 280z

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,520
as part of a whole stereo build out I'm

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,210
doing and here's a custom pot I did on

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,460
one of my other cars where I was

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,680
actually trying to also hide the hole

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,930
from another speaker so it's got kind of

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,539
strange shape but it happens to fit

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,280
snugly when the door shuts right in the

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,039
dashboard and actually I did also some

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,899
custom dining to make kind of silver and

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,150
black work so but this is a vinyl

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,700
wrapped custom pod we won't be vinyl

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,470
wrapping today but it's the last step in

29
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,659
of doing what we do and something you

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,729
can do yourself so as I said I'm going

31
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,090
to show a small tape well we're going to

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,979
do a one-off of a speaker pot so it

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,600
won't be stereo so I won't have a use

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,460
for it other than to show you how to

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,830
make them and then I'm also going to

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,650
show a regular fiberglass mat like you

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,630
might be used to thinking with marine or

38
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,770
Corvette bodies but it's also how we do

39
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,840
we turn like their spare tire well into

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,520
a whole bait speaker tell if I'm going

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,869
through that phase where I drove around

42
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,540
without a spare tire and I got burned by

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,329
I want so spare tires back in the car

44
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,350
now here's a throwaway pot I did earlier

45
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,470
the it's a couple years ago now I was

46
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,329
playing actually with the angles to see

47
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,950
what fit the car and everything and

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,590
actually uh what the speaker could fit

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,369
and if you see the detail there's an

50
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,229
offset ring in there that allows the

51
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,280
speaker to drop down in alright and I do

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,318
that with a router and we're not going

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,060
to talk fully about routers I'm going

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,380
well talk about mom

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,630
going to turn my router on today it's

56
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,710
just too hot and dusty in here already

57
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,440
temperature here New Jersey went from 65

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,080
to 95 this week so the thing about

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,640
speaker pots when we make them what

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,580
we're really trying to do is starting

61
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,410
with the backboard that or something

62
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,630
thinner than this but this is what I'm

63
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,200
using we want to mount the speaker ring

64
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,760
the thing that will hold the speaker and

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
whatever angle we want whatever cool

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,840
design we want in fact you know you

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,250
could do two of these and this would

68
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,910
represent your custom speaker plot this

69
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,150
happens to be India multi density medium

70
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,660
density fiberboard it's okay you get it

71
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,810
wet it sandwiches way up but it is

72
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,490
actually a lot nicer for routing and

73
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,120
stuff than plywood and some of the other

74
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,460
boards so I use a lot of MDF when I do

75
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,810
this so let's say this is why what my

76
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,850
speaker pod to look like where the rings

77
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,410
represent the speaker by the way these

78
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,870
are MDF rings you guys can buy them

79
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,700
pre-made I use a lot of pre-made ones

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,130
but then I make rings from them so I use

81
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,240
some more as templates because

82
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,220
ultimately I screw them off and I hope

83
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,380
to buy more you can cut them out with

84
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,750
circle cutters using your router again

85
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,090
there's the router you can do it with a

86
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,500
jigsaw and matter of fact I'm going to

87
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,570
be using a jigsaw today but I'm using

88
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,060
these pre-cut rings to represent the

89
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,850
speakers and this is my template I'm

90
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,950
going to trace onto a backboard of MDF

91
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,660
to mount my speakers

92
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,810
all right so there I've got my bottom of

93
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,090
my speaker pod I'm going to take it to

94
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,490
the sander which I actually keep in my

95
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,900
blacksmith shop but this will be books

96
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,660
but this will be what our speaker pod

97
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,680
looks like when we're done we'll have

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,900
speakers raised above it alright so I've

99
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,910
got a outline of my speaker pod I'm

100
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,550
going to take this out to the sander and

101
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,430
smooth it off but combined with the

102
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,380
Rings held off the ground I'm going to

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,850
held off the board I'm going to show you

104
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,590
how to do that this will be what our

105
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,510
speaker pod looks like our custom pod

106
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,560
all right

107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,750
sand it down before I do the next step

108
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,030
which is to put holes in here so we can

109
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,770
wire up the speakers and everything once

110
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,800
it's in I'm going to talk a little bit

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
about router because I'm going to use a

112
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,400
hole saw what it is but I could use a

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,169
router what is the router what I'm like

114
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:41,730
what do I keep talking about so let me

115
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,530
show you that so here's a full on our

116
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,240
table I don't use it on my bench like

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,060
this makes too much sawdust I use it

118
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,180
over in a different part of my garage

119
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,590
but let me show you a close-up of the

120
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,370
business end of this thing so here in

121
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,440
the center we've got a big motor down

122
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,080
below and what we are doing there we go

123
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,979
is we've got various rotating bits these

124
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,900
are nasty looking things these will

125
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,750
these will hurt too big time ok so

126
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,120
here's here's a ring that's two rings

127
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,710
that I've stapled and glued together and

128
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,690
it's got a shelf in here for a speaker

129
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,830
and I was able to do that with this

130
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,040
particular router bit the ball bearing

131
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,500
tracks the inside and this removes the

132
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,750
material to make a shell so I think

133
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,190
that's called the rabbiting well it's

134
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,510
been too long since I actually have the

135
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,280
names this one here would do the

136
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,250
opposite it would make a it would cut in

137
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,169
this far to whatever you're tracking and

138
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,260
they're the templates on the top just

139
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,880
like in that but it's a different you

140
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,200
know here the ball bearing is bigger

141
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,970
than the cutter here the ball bearing

142
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,250
smaller in the cutter and then here's

143
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,780
one where the cutter and the ball

144
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,250
bearing and same size and this where you

145
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,720
punch a hole and tray something out

146
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,210
directly so I could use this to make the

147
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,410
hole in the bottom of the pot but a lot

148
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,030
of noise and sawdust I'm just going to

149
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,100
use a hole cutter to

150
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,080
by the way you can do some cool things

151
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,570
especially you like a new plexiglass and

152
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,030
stuff let's see if you can see that

153
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,280
bevel here this is I polished this

154
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,290
myself and everything but I cut this

155
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,740
using this type of cutter and I was able

156
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,310
to make a beveled edge all the way

157
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,780
around and then like this from the

158
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,730
center and then put my amp on it okay

159
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,860
I've got my holes cut I've actually even

160
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,110
changed my headband I was dripping all

161
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,300
over everything here it's extremely hot

162
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,180
today I wanted to show you what a big

163
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,010
ring looks like right I have a whole

164
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,800
bunch of these so I just forgot about so

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,270
I thought I'd show you one for this for

166
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,710
obviously for the biggest of subwoofers

167
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,140
or for tracing the outline one but this

168
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,500
actually has the rim for for us a woofer

169
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,380
mounting so while I was doing this

170
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,670
something occurred to me I was thinking

171
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,720
of doing two rings like two speakers but

172
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
one things we can do is I took the

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,180
cutout from the small hole on the vs.

174
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,030
and I can do a flush mount tweeter

175
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,890
pointed whatever direction I want so I'm

176
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,720
actually going to do that just to change

177
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,100
it up a little so we're going to do one

178
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,050
ring in one flush mount now the fun

179
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,570
begins so we're going to make a frame of

180
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,940
rings and standoffs to make a crazy

181
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,800
shape for us and then we're going to

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,320
cover it with polyester fleece this is

183
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,460
stretchy stuff in the old days we used

184
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,290
grow clock which sucked

185
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,840
quite honestly didn't stretch it took

186
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,670
took a lot of strength and then never

187
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,680
incorporate itself into the wrist so

188
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,420
let's talk about rezulin a fiberglass

189
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,840
what is I buy mine by the gallon I get a

190
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,810
new gallon every every summer there's

191
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,090
the least one unopened gallon sitting

192
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,800
around here somewhere by the way no way

193
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,990
you just buzz the fiberglass is you

194
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,400
take all your heart or pour it in there

195
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,930
shake it up real good it turns into a

196
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,030
lump of inert material and you can throw

197
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,000
light but fibreglass has a limited date

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,730
okay it's good for like 90 days you know

199
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,480
I use a pass that but it's know it's

200
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,300
it's it's got a lifetime right so a lot

201
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,690
of these have born on dates they I even

202
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,440
went to my local marina or marine repair

203
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,529
I should say

204
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,049
and the the other the resident they had

205
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:18,569
they're not a lingual is ageless so you

206
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,339
couldn't tell but you didn't know if it

207
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,719
was the good stuff or not the good stuff

208
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,909
supposed to be read by the way a lot of

209
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,199
what I know is from listening a guy

210
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,119
named Robert Garza from select products

211
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,729
he was a fellow small business owner and

212
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:32,039
he catered to like the home audio market

213
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,870
and then he got bought by somebody now

214
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,219
they only deal with distributor so

215
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,979
Robert miss you guy but they saw a lot

216
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,870
of what he did in his videos you know

217
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,719
he'll tell you that it should be read

218
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
which indicates it's a prime resin

219
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,790
polyester resin and if you get it green

220
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,529
it means it's all the slop or together

221
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,139
it's not even guaranteed to set up okay

222
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,970
so I get a fresh buy I get mine from

223
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,860
fiberglass site so it's just easy to

224
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,249
remember I throw it around somewhere and

225
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,379
when you get it you get with it the

226
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:07,170
hardener and you also get some surfacing

227
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,930
wax to help it unstick from stuff and I

228
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,879
used to get my the or the harder is a

229
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,180
methyl ethyl ketone peroxide in ekp I

230
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,949
actually used to get that by big jars I

231
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:21,689
sweat look they're big big containers

232
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:24,269
and in the over the years the container

233
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,009
cracked and bent it out right so I'll be

234
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,980
using the stuff they gave me like

235
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,870
polyester resin you mix 1% one and a

236
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,069
half percent of your hardener and I use

237
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,620
this is old but I imagine it's okay but

238
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,199
I still use the new stuff this is how I

239
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,120
measured out is I figure out the

240
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,689
milliliters or the milliliters of resin

241
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,089
I'm doing and then I measured myself a

242
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,740
little bit by squeezing into this upper

243
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,019
cup and I pour it in so I don't do it by

244
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,819
the drops some people do it till turns

245
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:59,670
more it is an exothermic relationship

246
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,839
right they work need to get hot and we

247
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,550
actually have a chart that came with it

248
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,949
for hardener percentage versus

249
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:09,720
temperature and it's actually hot enough

250
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,399
I'm going to look at it today just to

251
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,259
see if I need to like be more closer to

252
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,389
one percent than one and a half percent

253
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,389
so the cool thing is when we use this

254
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:22,139
least it is polyester itself and so in

255
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,120
Weber I as Robert said from select

256
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,910
Roddick's it actually starts to dissolve

257
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,230
and the polyester so I'm going to

258
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,200
stretch this on a frame and we're going

259
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,780
to fiberglass it up so hang on so the

260
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,520
first thing I'm going to do is I am

261
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,400
going to hot glue little pieces of MDF

262
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,640
to act as little supporting struts for

263
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,370
my ring and hopefully I'll show you a

264
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,800
close-up of this on the bench itself but

265
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,630
you say hot glue but that's not very

266
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,260
stable

267
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,480
well all we need is this ring to sit in

268
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,250
the right position long enough for the

269
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:59,420
polyester to harden right so hot glue

270
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,830
[Applause]

271
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,790
okay now we've got my three posts and

272
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,930
again there just has to be strong enough

273
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,330
for the two to get this whole process

274
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,660
kicked off so I'll go ahead and and do

275
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,280
the Reg here and I'm usually not happy

276
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,770
until I have burned myself so I'm not

277
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,690
going to drop it in but if that's this

278
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,160
is the ring where the speaker would go

279
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,620
and it's now pointed in theory towards

280
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:53,470
the listeners there was just burn myself

281
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,270
my friend do I just want to make sure

282
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,040
that when I pull my fabric over this I

283
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,990
don't actually pick up a corner Ford I

284
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,030
didn't mean to I want this to be the

285
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,460
edge and this to be the edge and all

286
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,930
around here to be the edge that the

287
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,840
fabric catches okay a word about this

288
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,690
fleece I think my wife actually picked

289
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,850
this up at Joanne's it's just a

290
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,370
polyester fleece it does have directions

291
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,620
it stretches better so I try and get

292
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,150
that in the directions going to be the

293
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,150
worst for me there's a prairie saw get

294
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,730
in a not so far a sight so you you do

295
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,650
want to try and have the nuts a furry

296
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,000
side up you're going to spend a lot more

297
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,900
time of sanding for the next step I'm

298
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,450
going to staple my fabric down to the

299
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,060
frame while stretching it and I'm going

300
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,180
to use an air-powered stapler you could

301
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,920
use a regular stapler you could use

302
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,280
superglue I keep a one of those plastic

303
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,930
jars to cyanoacrylate and three

304
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,420
different speeds or densities and

305
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,130
there's nothing wrong with doing that I

306
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,540
just prefer to use stapler

307
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,330
so you can see it's starting to work

308
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,490
where I'm pulling it tight and I'm

309
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,850
actually doing the staples in the end

310
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,279
okay so here's what it looks like

311
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,110
completely stapled out through the

312
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,970
bottom so you'll notice I got to cut

313
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,570
this off and there is a row of staples

314
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,899
that will actually can grind off when

315
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,540
all this is done because it'll be

316
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,370
fiberglass at that point or enough will

317
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,019
have come around the edge so what I'm

318
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,220
going to do is I'm going to take a fresh

319
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,930
razor blade and I'm going to trim off

320
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,350
the bottom here and as I said they're

321
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,940
staples in here but we'll be actually

322
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,640
able to grind those off later now mostly

323
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,399
flat I'm going to do one more step where

324
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,820
I kind of hits on the missing spots but

325
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,649
I'm also been a staple in here to give

326
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,260
the ring to tighten everything and also

327
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,300
start the process of creating the the

328
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:06,490
drop out where the speaker would go okay

329
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,839
you can see what I've done here it's

330
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,220
actually tight as a drum here and

331
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,140
everything else is a little tighter and

332
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,700
I'm going to go ahead and cut this part

333
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,500
out with a razor blade now remember this

334
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,029
we can either drill later for our

335
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,220
tweeter or we can do a surface mount

336
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,600
tweeter on it just to be a little

337
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,820
different and the bottom is pretty much

338
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,380
clean again we've clean this up later

339
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,300
but we just want to lay flat while we're

340
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,620
working on it and there we are ready for

341
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,880
fiberglassing finally couldn't wait

342
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,700
could you the cool part the smelly part

343
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,110
the part that's cool because it's

344
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,820
smelling all right I have boxes of these

345
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,279
can't have enough of them go if you go

346
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,230
to Home Depot to get them you're going

347
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,209
to pay out the lodging but get a box for

348
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,930
100 from online Auto Supply places

349
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,220
they'll pay for himself the fourth time

350
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,140
you do this in my humble opinion I'm

351
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,180
going to is graduated all kinds of mix

352
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,980
ratios everything on here I'm going to

353
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,370
go 400 milliliters to cover this and

354
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,130
then I'm going to use it's between one

355
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,990
and one and a half percent well four

356
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,540
would be one percent six would be one

357
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,250
and a half so I'm going to shoot round

358
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,670
five or so when I pour it

359
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,310
to bracket it all right you should be

360
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,170
wearing gloves for this only problem I

361
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,910
have is I never know what to do with the

362
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,490
the results of finger it seems like done

363
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,400
it's not with the rest a technique I

364
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,760
learned 4/4 and resin is to pour from

365
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,580
the top have the have the outlet at the

366
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:43,360
top all right like I said I got a nice

367
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,340
reddish color here that usually denotes

368
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,280
a higher quality polyester going add my

369
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,940
partner Emmy KP methyl ethyl ketone

370
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,870
peroxide if you remember your tea tones

371
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,760
you stick a methyl and ethyl together

372
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,140
with Athena a double bond a low or

373
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,220
something like that the middle that's

374
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,960
for a lot of smells and stuff come from

375
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,250
this stuff smells great

376
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,080
don't you be sniffing it you should be

377
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,270
wearing a mask I'm old my brains gone so

378
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,630
I'm past the point but save yourselves

379
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,210
so I usually use the screwdriver for

380
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,970
this I can't find my firm screwdriver so

381
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,560
I'm going to use one of these again my

382
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,360
Home Depot got stingy with these so I

383
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,220
bought a big ol box of these things I

384
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,710
give them out as party favors so and

385
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,920
when we stir this you're actually going

386
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,350
to see a change in not just the color

387
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,210
and the consistency you're going to see

388
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,010
it actually kind of move through it and

389
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,300
that's when it's starting the ball and

390
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,840
it will actually get a little clearer

391
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,550
also I do in this i buy crap loads of

392
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,490
cheap paintbrushes you know might get

393
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,530
twenty four nine dollars or five dollars

394
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,670
or something

395
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,890
so you Pro Malay when you're done now if

396
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,270
you can see that the color has changed

397
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,730
it's no longer reddish pink it's

398
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,220
becoming clear with just a tenth of a

399
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,650
red overtone to it in the center and we

400
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,910
are going to soak the material so that

401
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,250
is it there's no air left in the

402
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,020
material and you'll see what I mean now

403
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,470
usually I do this on a desk I have just

404
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,839
for this kind of thing but I don't have

405
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,819
a camera shot what I'm really trying to

406
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,740
do is use the paintbrush just to convey

407
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,060
a mess of a polyester of the resin to

408
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,210
the material you need you may or may not

409
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,859
be able to

410
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,709
see what I'm doing but you'll see me

411
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,510
chase the light spots it doesn't hurt to

412
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,350
try and brush the fibers flat a little

413
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,240
bit less aiming for later but at the end

414
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,580
of the day you're going to be doing lots

415
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,770
of sanding anyways I'm going to go ahead

416
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,720
and make sure that the back side is 5 or

417
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,420
to where it comes from sorry coded to

418
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,480
where it comes around the corner so that

419
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,340
later when I sand it off I'm sanded

420
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,580
fiberglass flush all right

421
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,010
it's coated I'll show it to you better

422
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,620
after it sets up and actually I give a

423
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,780
secret one of the pigs did kind of let

424
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,610
loose from all the pulling I did have to

425
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,679
get in there with some epoxy and so it's

426
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,230
a little deformed and so at this point

427
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,630
I'm wanting the the fiberglass to set up

428
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,210
before I do a bunch of gyration with it

429
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,210
so I'll give this up now I'm going to

430
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,190
get give it half an hour and we'll come

431
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,110
back and check on it all right here we

432
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,070
go here at the fiberglass to set up may

433
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,020
look the thing but all very solid

434
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,000
I got a nice good outset but it's no

435
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,820
sexy sticky spots on it a good way to

436
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,049
tell if all of your resin setup is you

437
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:39,669
get to make a little abstract art set

438
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,350
that around people pick that up wonder

439
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,870
what's going on and you can reuse

440
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,480
container so the next step is body putty

441
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,750
and it's I use rage gold you'll see this

442
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,480
a lot used in the audio magazines and

443
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,850
stuff so you see a key in the small I

444
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,890
normally buy it by the gallon I bought

445
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,660
this just so I could do this thing today

446
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,110
and then also a metal glaze

447
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,990
now the body putty typically leaves

448
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,020
pinholes the metal glaze leaves smaller

449
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,049
pin holes they're still pinholes with

450
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,490
you know just a little pocket if you

451
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,169
were to paint you tease little pockets

452
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:16,150
and so you end up wanting to use a high

453
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,950
build primer and trust me why do all

454
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,710
this i if I'm doing it for a real thing

455
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,510
for my car I actually use automotive

456
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,549
spray paint I've got the air hose with

457
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:27,100
the dryer in it I've got big paint cans

458
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,450
here and stuff another technique to do

459
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,410
is to actually mix the body putty with

460
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,660
resin 50

461
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,550
and I've heard it called a lot of things

462
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,490
I call it goop okay I'm not doing that

463
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,500
today almost it but I was just like all

464
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,930
to say anytime on it when you sand down

465
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,870
body putty within an hour after it sets

466
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,790
it's a lot easier to wear actually 15

467
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,230
minutes so I'm just thinking of this a

468
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,870
coat of body putty maybe mix in some

469
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,940
some metal glaze we'll see how that goes

470
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,680
now I'm going to say in this down so

471
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,740
give me a bit so I've got my body putty

472
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,310
on my board that is basically a tablet

473
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,730
of paper attached to a board to hold it

474
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,500
and this actually kind of useful they

475
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,510
sell this auto body supply places on the

476
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,380
web you'll need a scraper yes I have a

477
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,440
box of scrapers Home Depot doesn't even

478
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,180
give them why and the general accepted

479
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,010
way to doing the Horner is to leave a

480
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,080
trail partners this will find its own I

481
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,180
scooped it on the paper this will find

482
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,130
its own diameter due to viscosity and

483
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,230
then the general thing is to leave a

484
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,990
trail the harder across the diameter of

485
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,160
it like so and then and I'm not as good

486
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,200
at this as I should be if you watch guys

487
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,540
to do this for real they do this motion

488
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,190
see we're actually going to go for a

489
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,810
green color by the time in the blue and

490
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,880
everything mixes they do it without

491
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,250
mixing air into it I guess Marin

492
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,330
alright looks like crack doesn't it

493
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,270
America's getting a hot eye

494
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,429
I've taken some shortcuts that I

495
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,780
shouldn't I should have sanded that

496
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,880
fiberglass first because I had to work

497
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,770
my ass off just to get a covering on

498
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,390
this I'm going to say in almost all of

499
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,299
this back off and there's just pits and

500
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,700
holes just do the nature the way be

501
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,590
rough fiberglass in the body putty came

502
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,370
to go the mini starts this way I am not

503
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,289
worried with that said it's not going to

504
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,000
be a prize-winner I'm trying to just get

505
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,620
through a video here so I'm going to let

506
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,940
this set up but not too long it actually

507
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,429
gets harder to work after an hour it

508
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:55,710
becomes cement alright that was a brutal

509
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,049
sanding session it's 90 degrees here in

510
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,530
New Jersey again today very humid

511
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,299
evidently my son used all of my reusable

512
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,760
but yet disposable hefty filter aside a

513
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,590
pug off put on the bug as we used to say

514
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,059
in the army

515
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:13,169
and I had to sand my ass off as you can

516
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,030
see here now my friends during this

517
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,280
process were rowlocks alright these

518
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,669
things that particular one and then the

519
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:25,140
green one now they'll take the skin

520
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,929
right off your bone it's only useful for

521
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,730
knocking the corners down you cannot

522
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,220
sculpt with it you need something else

523
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,080
to sculpt with I couldn't find my

524
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,760
air-powered orbital sander so I went to

525
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,419
my electric one problem is the de pads

526
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,740
are so old they were coming off the

527
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,659
adhesives or the adhesives coming off

528
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,600
the the pad right but I still got to

529
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,039
this part and then I was able to

530
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,320
actually even use one of these in my air

531
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,880
tool to rough it in in here

532
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,220
they're our pin holes all over this

533
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,650
place and I don't know that I care for

534
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,120
what we're doing here I might show you a

535
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,400
trick I used to cheat where you can't

536
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,650
see the holes as much so I might go back

537
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,299
in with my metal guys I might not but

538
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,309
I'm taking a break alright here we are

539
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:10,620
another day I've decided to do it right

540
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,130
sleep is a good thing right if you look

541
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,070
there's a divot there right that's

542
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,230
that's bigger in a pin hole but that's

543
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,880
the same one I did there was an air hole

544
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,290
in the body cut

545
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,059
and it's quite common when you start

546
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:28,210
with the rough stuff and like I said

547
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,559
then you approach it with metal glaze or

548
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,480
mixture metal blades and body putty I'm

549
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,510
going to do a couple of these with the

550
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,400
metal days so that you do see all the

551
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,380
steps involved the thing to notice here

552
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,240
with the metal glaze is it's running

553
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,950
right that's how we're going to fill the

554
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,750
hole since I don't know of any other

555
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,390
properties actually we even use the same

556
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,570
partner we same technique I'm going to

557
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,049
put rner just cross the the diameter of

558
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:01,990
the pulip arms and I just made the

559
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,330
mistake since been a couple days not

560
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,370
really given my heart our good squishy

561
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:12,220
squishy to mix it up so Ruth so where

562
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,540
I'm going after some of these holes

563
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,549
trying to get a highlight there so you

564
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:17,679
can see it I'm just going ahead and I'm

565
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,480
pushing this into the holes and I'll

566
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,740
probably come back across with my little

567
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,700
green thing to smooth it out and I'm not

568
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,110
going to do this whole thing I'm going

569
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,100
to cheat and I wanted to cheat not even

570
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,960
do this stuff but here we are and here

571
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,059
you actually see the glaze some of its

572
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:46,270
advantage this bends a little bit and so

573
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:55,690
I can get a nice nice cut going a nice

574
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,260
smooth see it's already smoother let's

575
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,390
get the light on here one of my lights

576
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,730
blew out too during the heat spoon or a

577
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,790
smoother than the body putty and it's

578
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,360
already hard means I used a little too

579
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,860
much all that right stuff came out used

580
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,080
a little too much it also does harden

581
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,030
pests which means I can cycle faster

582
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,860
this will be set up I can go to the

583
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,210
sander I'm actually going to show you my

584
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,390
orbital sander next thing main reason is

585
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,309
the temperatures block the drop below 95

586
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:28,830
degrees here so we're happy all right

587
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,510
because of the dust I'm doing this just

588
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,510
outside my garage when I'm really doing

589
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,190
this for real I actually have an area I

590
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,880
clean

591
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,250
but I just didn't get to it and I'm not

592
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,320
going to make a dusty Mouse how the area

593
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,990
you saw so here we are the sun's going

594
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,420
up and down forgive me when I was

595
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,610
sanding a really rough stuff I used an

596
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,280
air sander air hose goes here and this

597
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,380
stuff which will take your fingers off

598
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,930
if you if you get into it right and then

599
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,400
there's a green version of this that's

600
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,770
even rougher this is called a roll lock

601
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,140
because of the little threaded thing and

602
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,020
it just goes right on there and you swap

603
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,370
those out as soon as you wear them out

604
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,050
and that stuff wears even these things

605
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,870
out okay so the other kind of sander is

606
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,150
this ones are powered also this is an

607
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,640
orbital sander meaning it doesn't just

608
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,220
spin and make concentric grooves and

609
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,410
cuts and burns in you it kind does a

610
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,470
pattern and I'm going to use my electric

611
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,810
one and I'm going to show you you can

612
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,340
actually touch this while it's running

613
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,190
because it's so smooth it's not actively

614
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,370
going there's there's a planetary gears

615
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,510
in here and stuff

616
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,539
and get like composure so I'm going to

617
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,460
briefly smooth off the metal glaze you

618
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,049
just saw me put on yes I should have a

619
00:26:49,049 --> 00:27:00,210
mask on so basically you saw me using

620
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,039
the very front of it as much as possible

621
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,929
I didn't have to worry about gouging and

622
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:06,510
stuff due to the nature of the sander

623
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,860
and let me show you the next thing we do

624
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,750
as I get closer as a final product I

625
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,549
start getting cleaner I'm not going to

626
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,520
wipe this down just yet but I'm going to

627
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:25,370
give it a good something with air and

628
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,960
normally I might even vacuum the inside

629
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,049
out but again we're skipping stuff my

630
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:35,700
next step is to use some high-build

631
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,950
primer I happen to use some for it they

632
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,840
make a whole line of automotive stuff so

633
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,980
I figured they know what they're doing

634
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,169
usually I use one of these stuck to a

635
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:46,409
can but this has a kind of nozzle

636
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:47,880
probably won't fit but it's probably a

637
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,710
better nozzle normal this I could you

638
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,299
put that on a can it makes it into a

639
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,470
spray gun for you

640
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,590
I do have spray gun equipment and an air

641
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,210
dryer and everything else maybe I'll

642
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,860
show you that so I don't usually

643
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,350
rattle-can all of this stuff but you

644
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,409
certainly can some half my stuff is

645
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:10,080
rattle tin all right

646
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,780
trick here on clean your can when you're

647
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:18,799
done spray it tilts out of there I

648
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,120
actually did get a little wet I got

649
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,890
grass up as I came around second dog

650
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,470
basically you spray it you let it dry

651
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,720
you spray it again you you try and

652
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,669
overlap your spray but a dusty spray is

653
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:30,960
better especially for high build primer

654
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,120
because you want it to expand and land

655
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,830
on this thing the more you hit it with

656
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,320
the air to try and clean it up the more

657
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,770
pinholes you've seen you get in a cycle

658
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,179
so when you do this for real you'll

659
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,730
you'll lose lots of layers of something

660
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,980
like a primer to finally give you your

661
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,690
automotive finish if you're going that

662
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,510
direction I'm going to cheat I'm going

663
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,880
to use something that has texture to try

664
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,290
and hide

665
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,060
my pinholes and stuff this is probably

666
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,950
my favorite texture too so let me show

667
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,480
you that first I am going to say on this

668
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,340
so with the help Michael primer I would

669
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,690
be that you should buy time you get that

670
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,000
staff your hand sandy and then we're

671
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,380
going to go for a textured paint so as

672
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,360
you probably know with painting clean

673
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,660
clean clean right if your paint flakes

674
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,960
off probably one click and even though

675
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,960
it looks like so I you know I have tack

676
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,700
cloths things like that i'm just using a

677
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,200
pre painting prep this one's from

678
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,090
eastwood there's a lot of kinds you can

679
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,220
use I tend not to use this acetone on

680
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,490
this though not afraid to either but

681
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,560
acetone melts too many things so take

682
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,610
that back so since I don't have a attack

683
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,300
off with me I got a box upstairs but

684
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,490
it's way too hot to go get it so I'm

685
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,690
just going to spray it wipe it with a

686
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,560
microfiber cloth

687
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,279
all right so normally like I said you

688
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,470
should be wearing a mask and even gloves

689
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,730
and all this and this cloud will

690
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,499
probably let go over and land on my cars

691
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:59,169
but offer the name of a hackaday video

692
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:02,320
right so what I've got is satin black

693
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,320
chip guard by SEM let's see if we can

694
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,610
good in light again

695
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,740
some happens to make it chip guard you

696
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,120
ever see that text here along the

697
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,950
running board of your car that's their

698
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,929
kind of for chips of rocks to come off

699
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:15,879
and it's kind of got a satin or velvet

700
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:18,490
texture to it and you can get satin and

701
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,529
velvet texture paints you can get

702
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,480
additives to paints or even a clear

703
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,629
paint that you put down for texture and

704
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:27,549
then come over with an automotive paint

705
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:30,340
or something this is on one can I just

706
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,440
happen to choose black satin black chip

707
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,269
guard so we're going to go ahead and

708
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:36,070
give this a texture they'll hopefully

709
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,850
hide some of our are bigger divots in it

710
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,799
can't stress how much shaky you know

711
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,690
mixing is appropriate here I do get to

712
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,580
use my gun this way my finger doesn't

713
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,289
get all covered with paint and again

714
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:52,389
same thing we're just going for like

715
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:55,210
coats that overlap don't I get the best

716
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,909
spray pattern out of it this time fit is

717
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:01,690
what it is I'm sure I'll get enough by

718
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,110
its time I've done it several times

719
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,429
alright I'm going to let that dry I got

720
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:08,590
where this shot the first time is just

721
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,779
way too wet so I do have to let that a

722
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:13,269
boil off let the organics come with and

723
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:15,820
volatile organic feels he come out of

724
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,830
there so that I get a chance to put a

725
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,740
dry coke must of the rest of its alright

726
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,210
so I've decided to go with the sunken

727
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,340
tweeter so I could have done a ring

728
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,129
earlier or I can just use my trusty hole

729
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:29,710
saw on the flat spot we make holes all

730
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,090
it is again throw with these name going

731
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,168
to Center it up and measure

732
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,120
I don't even know if this is the right

733
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,409
size hole all right

734
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:46,390
home stretch for your speaker pod so to

735
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,799
show you just a couple of patient

736
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:53,470
details time to screw the speaker into

737
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,039
the pot well you can you want to dress

738
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,809
that up a little bit you don't have to

739
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:01,030
use regular Phillips screws I'll use

740
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,530
what's called a security head screw and

741
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,900
it looks kind of cool has a special bit

742
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,580
let me show you under the other camera

743
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,830
here's the head it's got two holes in it

744
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,830
and that fits our bit like this

745
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,340
so when when we're done when we're done

746
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,429
we don't have Phillips head time for a

747
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:20,650
speaker grill I've been doing this a

748
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,360
while I have a box of speaker grilles

749
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,179
since a pretty much changed sites I can

750
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:30,100
pick what I want form it to fifth I'm

751
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,049
going to I try very hard cuz this is the

752
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:37,780
throwaway press and there's a pity

753
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,270
speaker pot now real life I probably

754
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:46,570
make these silver alright real life I'd

755
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,159
make these silver I would probably

756
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,200
disassemble this tweeter if I was really

757
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,400
using it and I would die or spray the

758
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,289
parts of the grille silver for the

759
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:59,679
contrast and Sam and these other

760
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,530
companies do make dyes as well as paints

761
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,809
so sometimes use the dye special and

762
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:07,659
leather on some of the plastics and then

763
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,340
you prep it and it actually opens the

764
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,350
pore of the plastic and it's not paint

765
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,470
it goes in there and colors the plastic

766
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,549
and you don't have to worry about little

767
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:17,650
flakes coming off your grille so but

768
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,770
there's our face speaker pod - about 20

769
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,510
hours of sanding not that much but

770
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,460
there's sandy and I couldn't afford and

771
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,380
we did this using you know some

772
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,210
standoffs and some fabric because you

773
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,830
saw me do to create the shape all right

774
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,659
I want to show you more fiberglassing

775
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:39,760
why because I've already made a mess

776
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,590
it's already hot I'm sweating my

777
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,929
electrons off so I'm going to show you

778
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:49,120
some of the standard standard some of

779
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,039
the legacy some of the regular ways to

780
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,820
do fiberglassing you

781
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,070
for example I've got to been here this

782
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,620
could be like your rear tire your spare

783
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,360
tire well a lot of people like remove

784
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,850
the spare tire put our subwoofer there I

785
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,680
did it one day I broke down in the

786
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,180
middle of a New Jersey Road in the rain

787
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,120
with no spare kind of undid my subwoofer

788
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,489
a little bit or this could be like the

789
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:13,570
side of in your trunk where you want to

790
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:18,409
mold a speaker to or whatever you want

791
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,210
but in my case I'm just talking about

792
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,120
speakers to to the to the car itself

793
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,030
without damaging the car itself so so

794
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,530
what I've done for starters is I've

795
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,270
taken my green tape there in the blue

796
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,480
tape I think this is what I've used

797
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,300
that's why I see everybody else use the

798
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,639
3m I'm sorry but yeah the 3m Scotch

799
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,340
green tape and I've covered half of it

800
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,389
now this starts the protective barrier

801
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:47,630
between what I want to uh fibreglass up

802
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,940
against but it's just the start it's

803
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,850
still porous so I'm going to then do

804
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,440
some other thing I've seen people where

805
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,820
they go in with the wax and do the

806
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,320
fiberglass next I'm going to put another

807
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,100
layer in there to protect the car if you

808
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,990
think of this is like the side of a card

809
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,020
I'm doing a subwoofer here's something I

810
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,070
bet you can't do alright what I'm going

811
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,360
to do is I'm going to take my regular

812
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,020
old 3m multi-purpose adhesive I've put

813
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,600
up headliners with this and stuff now

814
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,790
I'm going to take some aluminum foil and

815
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,820
I'm going to adhere the aluminum foil to

816
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,590
the tape so the tape when it comes off

817
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,060
will protect your car from the adhesive

818
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,540
but this stuff is not for us

819
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,310
fiberglass can't get through it the

820
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:38,740
resin fiberglass can't stick to it

821
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,050
you can try and make the aluminum foil

822
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,000
flat I always start with that as my goal

823
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,430
never achieve it and in complex shapes

824
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,470
cleaned up with having to do multiple

825
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,420
overlaps and even occasionally patching

826
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,250
it this case you see me spraying the

827
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:57,260
foil itself to patch a hole again this

828
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,270
is our protection especially if it's

829
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,840
somebody else's car right so I've left a

830
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,310
little green so we can see our layers

831
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,830
underneath is tape and then aluminum

832
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,080
foil tape down now I'm going to lay some

833
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,900
fiberglass matting in here fiberglass

834
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,580
matting lots of different kinds in

835
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,640
weights and I'll tell you that when you

836
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,590
go to do a free-form standing I mean

837
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,950
this is a quite freeform you need a lot

838
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,470
of fiberglass you build it up a layer at

839
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,120
a time if you try and build a big little

840
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,890
thick fat layer to crack and hair of air

841
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,220
bubbles it's time-consuming process so

842
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,900
you do start with thicker weights if you

843
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,930
see this is shreds of glass all right

844
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,660
and what they get fibreglass right so

845
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,030
what they do in production houses is

846
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,620
they actually have a shredder gun that

847
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,040
has the fiber mat coming to it and it's

848
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,960
got chakra blades that actually blows

849
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,550
this this stuff see it's getting all

850
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,550
over me already in real time mixing it

851
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,650
with fight with the resin in the gun and

852
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,130
in the air actually in private gun and

853
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,090
deposits it but we're going to do it the

854
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,230
old-fashioned way I'm going to cut some

855
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,870
pieces of this lay it into this now I'll

856
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,430
show you one thing there are other

857
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,260
materials that can make the process

858
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,300
quicker if you look this is a polyester

859
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,670
type each thing has got holes in it and

860
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,410
stuff I got this from select products

861
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,570
six years ago don't know where to get it

862
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,010
now but I'm sure you can find it again

863
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,320
what you're looking for something some

864
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,690
kind of matting compatible with

865
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,060
polyester resin so let's start this

866
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,770
sometimes you can cut it this stuff's

867
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,570
coming apart by hand for me so I'm going

868
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,730
to turn me off some tres but I'm going

869
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,200
to keep tearing it into smaller shreds

870
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:37,520
to lay it into here if you can see that

871
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,380
and I'm not doing a perfect job here

872
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,210
this is again I'm blowing through it for

873
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,490
the sake of a video but I've laid it in

874
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,960
there a lot of times you put the resin

875
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
down first I'm going to soak the resin

876
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,630
through and I'll show you that

877
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,839
I now have little fiberglass hairs

878
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,390
hanging off my glasses and all right I'm

879
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,310
seeing the color change it's going clear

880
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:04,609
maybe you can see it now you got lots of

881
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:07,280
these right cheap old brushes by I'm 50

882
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,829
cents each I could sit here and dip this

883
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,810
and dab in there and you keep doing it

884
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,060
until you see no air bubbles you stipple

885
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,550
it you you just go after and keep

886
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,740
pushing the air bubbles out or you can

887
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,109
have one of these this has these little

888
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:23,450
rulers and this thing's job is to push

889
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,730
the air bubbles out so if you can afford

890
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,369
one of these great I have two sizes can

891
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:30,800
from the other one you can do it with

892
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,240
this now since this is a captive

893
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,130
container I'm going to go ahead and pour

894
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,630
the resin in and then spread it around

895
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,589
so what you're going to see is you're

896
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:41,720
going to see me rolling the bubbles out

897
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,520
of the matting and then adding more

898
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,660
matting I just keep adding more and more

899
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,130
of this I'm trying to get it actually

900
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,869
stiff enough that I can take it out to

901
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:56,630
show you what I'm done in real life I'd

902
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,069
be here the rest of the day and use this

903
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,230
whole sheet I think alright I'm going to

904
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,240
let that set there's a limit look see

905
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,250
it's almost see-through right that's my

906
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,440
first layer but I've chased the bubbles

907
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,390
out which is important if I kept just

908
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,740
adding to this while all in one all in

909
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,420
one batch it wouldn't be as strong you

910
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,180
need to let it set up this thing needs

911
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,270
to go in acetone alright I gave it a

912
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,369
little time to set up as I said you do

913
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:24,560
this several times but I've peeled the

914
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,810
aluminum foil back there's still some

915
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,900
stuck to it but you can see a start of

916
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,579
what would be a Speakerbox

917
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:34,550
or or whatever it is you'd want to do

918
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,250
this and more importantly we've left if

919
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,150
this was a car part of a car inside the

920
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,710
trunk or something it sun damage and a

921
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,750
little bit of I pull the tape off of the

922
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,380
aluminum foil that got stuck but again

923
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,869
there's our molded part of the recess

924
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:56,540
it's a basic fiberglass Pods whatever

925
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,250
you want to do you can custom that

926
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,990
doesn't have to be a speaker politest

927
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:05,010
and you know various ones we've done so

928
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,470
this was just basic fiberglassing to

929
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,920
show you that you grab yourself a grab

930
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,109
yourself a gallon of resin again I use

931
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:15,570
fiberglass site.com you can use whatever

932
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,940
you want try and get fresh try not to

933
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,940
get it from a store shelf somewhere it's

934
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,030
who knows how old and get some paint

935
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,400
brushes it cleans up with acetone if you

936
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,910
need to do that create modern works of

937
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:34,200
art as I've said and you know trip out

938
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,140
on it so bill heard from hackaday hope

939
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,760
to see you again when it's not near as

940
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,130
hot it'll be contest see how many people

941
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,130
find out how how many people notice how

942
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,349
many times I change my shirt while

943
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:50,490
filming this so till the next time maybe

944
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,080
I'll tell you why there's an oven in my

945
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,030
garage
