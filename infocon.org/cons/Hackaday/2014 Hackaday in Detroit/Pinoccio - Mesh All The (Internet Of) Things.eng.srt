1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,170
I'm from Pinocchio what is this

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,690
so Pinocchio is a Arduino compatible

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,730
microcontroller that's connected to the

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,559
web read a box and it's got mesh

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,150
networking bait dragon it's the

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:26,970
architecture of this connects to know

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,779
yes modules yeah and these are what

8
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,590
these are either to 1514 yep or gears

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,329
using RF mesh so all the boards are

10
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,219
talking to each other locally using mesh

11
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,800
radio and then one board can bridge up

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,360
to the web that has Wi-Fi or you can

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,250
just run a standalone mesh network if

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,140
you're doing remote since our networks

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,670
and the field cuz you can find on a

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,980
research you can do that it doesn't

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,469
break the network if you lose Wi-Fi or

18
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,329
if you're out of range of Wi-Fi so all

19
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,850
these the mesh is like automatically

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,880
reconfigure and you can you can

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,880
broadcast messages to every node and the

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,049
whole group you can selectively

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,500
broadcasting to tasks just to one more

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,760
and of course you can do like automated

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,259
triggering we're trying to push all of

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,759
the intelligence to the edge of the

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,340
network so that these boards can still

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,560
work autonomously you know the sensor

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,780
reading on web board gets up a certain

30
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,700
predetermined threshold it can trigger

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,770
action on another board over here and

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,110
every board routes on behalf of the

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,360
whole network it's coordinator this so

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,470
it makes it really lightweight really

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,110
resilient if one node drops off the

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,259
network its self-healing

37
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:43,439
so getting started stuff first project

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,540
yeah how do we do that

39
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,990
you pull the board's out of the box flip

40
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,390
them on plug in your Wi-Fi board get it

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,270
to connect to Wi-Fi just using Chrome so

42
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,619
once it's connected you can unplug it

43
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,330
provision the rest of the boards now

44
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,880
they're talking to the web and typically

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,380
the way that people are using it out of

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,460
the boxes they're just sending

47
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,289
over-the-air simple scripting commands

48
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,270
from HQ which is our web app so you'll

49
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,160
see a little console you could just do

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,038
you know LED red and blue to the LED

51
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,870
change wirelessly and from there you can

52
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,269
start to build out have some functions

53
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,500
you can always program this with the

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,959
Argentina IDE if you prefer but the

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,000
scripting language that we have laid on

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,100
top of this is pretty robust you can do

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,799
pretty complex projects just so you

58
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,590
don't you don't need to use your your

59
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,470
web thing you don't so we're trying to

60
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,630
make it so any piece of this that's

61
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,430
useful for you you can just use that you

62
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,500
know your there's no notion of like a

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,239
walled garden you don't have to use our

64
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,650
software stack with these boards you

65
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,590
don't have to you know you're not locked

66
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,390
into using our web app in particular you

67
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,519
can you can spit up your own instance of

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,620
the API locally so if you're doing you

69
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,640
know we have some product design

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,859
agencies that are doing work that's

71
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:54,989
under NDA and by contract that are

72
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,730
required to do all their stuff

73
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,649
physically and certainly in-house so

74
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,209
some of this this Pinocchio is it's

75
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,250
invented and streaming right so any

76
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,870
changes that happen in this Pinocchio

77
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,299
those cheeses are meaning he needed to

78
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,359
be sent to the guy and a guy sent them

79
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:24,870
out on the event screen for this sound

80
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,130
and so this client side page I have this

81
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,540
page would be that we have a Mitchell

82
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,480
the things it subscribes to that to then

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,030
stream and then when he guest a new

84
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,760
event like bulb on was pressed it can

85
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,680
make changes to the site so if I just

86
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,430
press this little button

87
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,470
and set up so that if if this button is

88
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,290
being pressed all of those little

89
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,269
circles turn into activate logos and

90
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,790
actually you see the text changes to to

91
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,920
hack all the tanks instead of mesh

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,150
elements so when I let go the site is

93
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,230
fun hat press to the fact again so it's

94
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,170
a little effector website done and it's

95
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,420
it's doing that for anyone else who's

96
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,519
looking at the page too so you know not

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,799
just me you're not to see once this page

98
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,260
is subscribe to that event stream so any

99
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,029
changes that happen over my Pinocchio

100
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,180
are immediately broadcast to the site to

101
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,449
the side
