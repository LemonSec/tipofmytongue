Larson I'm with team detroit asst we we

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,189
decided to reinvent the wheel to in the

22
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,290
ways that you fight blight and you urban

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,750
farm with a giant air cannon that can be

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,229
packed full of mulch and seeds to plant

25
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,990
abandoned lots or really anything in a

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,930
blink of an eye and alternatively you

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,220
know since now we have a giant air

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,979
cannon we can also paint blighted houses

29
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,310
with one gallon buckets of paint and

30
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,900
salt the roads because Detroit is really

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,670
bad about plowing plowing and salting

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,180
their roads
