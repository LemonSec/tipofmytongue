50
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,790
team with their own helicopter I think

51
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,470
that's my they didn't fly we might have

52
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,570
been jaded by picking them because they

53
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,450
had a helicopter but they're amazing fun

54
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,930

56
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,080
here which is the the host of this event

57
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,600
is detritus Detroit itís how do you say

58
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,730
it to Detroit asst Detroit is I have a

59
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,410
really hectic freighter feel a little

60
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,299
bit of ditcher yeah treatise it's

61
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,940
Detroit asst which is head up by Doyle

62
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,130
who is the resident artist here and icon

63
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,650
of Detroit he's built a giant 60-foot

64
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,420
long dragon that shoots fires if they

65
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,079
roll around Detroit and when the cops

66
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,519
pull him over they actually just take

67
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,850
pictures

68
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,200
of the thing and then send them on the

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,250
way they don't know what to do with it

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,050
so the dragon is like this mythical

71
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,260
