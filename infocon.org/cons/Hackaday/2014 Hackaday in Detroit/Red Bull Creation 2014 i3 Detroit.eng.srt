1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,270
so your i3 Detroit your i3 Detroit we

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,250
are Michigan Detroit Michigan's first

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,649
and finest hackerspace okay and you're

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:08,940
reinventing the wheel how are you doing

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,230
this we are we are reinventing the

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,049
Scarecrow the Scarecrow he has come from

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,000
the future to save Detroit with urban

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,539
farming he is Robo crop and he will so

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,029
here's a robotic scarecrow that will

10
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,630
watch over your urban farm and squirt

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,910
water at birds and tents and will

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,170
measure soil conditions and moisture and

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,260
that kind of thing okay yeah and you're

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,280
gonna get this done of course okay

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,739
you're halfway through already halfway

16
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,079
through your bill doesn't it look done

17
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,840
it's us it's us this would obviously

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,000
scatter small mammal

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,820
damn straight okay hi I'm Murray anga

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,649
I'm fight of the ISB Detroit team for

21
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,050
the Red Bull creation competition for

22
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,399
the last three days we have been

23
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,820
building a robotic scarecrow who lives

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,250
in a windshield greenhouse we call him a

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,720
Robo crop we got the idea we're thinking

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,940
about ways things to help improve

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,520
Detroit and we thought transportation

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,410
was too big for three people are four

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,020
people lighting was too big something

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,450
simple that one person could do few

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,740
people could do for people to do is

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,600
build it up slowly you start with some

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,280
urban farming ideas so we came up with

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,460
Robo crop to help with urban farming and

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,409
beyond being a scarecrow

36
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,530
he also waters the plants monitors the

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,569
soil conditions

38
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,630
he motion controls water controls water

39
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,460
sensors automatically waters the plants

40
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,080
takes care of the farm for you while

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,409
you're away

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,750
we even has the camera so you can

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,250
observe it remotely from your cell phone

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,259
or from your computer and know what's

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,560
going on at your farm plus you can farm

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,520
throughout the winter with the

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,630
greenhouse may different yields
