1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
so here we got Army Corp from Detroit

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,650
you're reinventing the wheel how are you

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,550
doing this but we we're going to go off

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,130
our our original project was called

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,630
reach detroit and basically what it is a

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,599
bunch of nodes that up across the city

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,020
it'll be a computer fed information

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,500
center so by that i mean people will be

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,910
able to upload events and things going

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,170
on in different communities and they'll

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,410
be up at party stores and libraries and

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,210
things like that or something like we

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,880
just like the center recycle now yeah we

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,440
can have one out front here cause local

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,670
people are coming to recycle like

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,610
there's block party there is you know

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,649
food drive there's these different

18
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,600
things going on so that was our original

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,950
concept and we're gonna go with that and

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,300
put our unit this time is going to be

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,700
more portable and it's going to be

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,440
specifically for eastern market so it

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,260
would be a portable node for eastern

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,890
market okay so I am Hank I'm a member of

25
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,809
omni credit or a based in eastern market

26
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,079
detroit michigan and the omni core

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,090
Detroit team participated and redbull

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,369
creation and created a demonstration

29
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,590
project for a messaging system that

30
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,229
could be a platform to get community

31
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,450
messages out to all of Detroit's

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,770
neighborhoods we started with a

33
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,799
demonstration project that was based

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,270
around the idea that it would be placed

35
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,700
in eastern market it's a kiosk and it

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,979
brings people together to prepare food

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,360
that they've made in the market make a

38
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,220
smoothie maybe grill some veggies that

39
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,229
they've bought but in the meantime they

40
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,290
can look at the feed of community events

41
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,880
that have been submitted through a forum

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,549
on reach detroit us and it'll be

43
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,130
submitted on and displayed on to the

44
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,680
screen at the kiosk and at the same time

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,710
as they're socializing with fellow

46
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,680
residents they can also find out about

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,170
community events oh that was

48
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,610
intentionally to respond to the request
