1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,949
you know I really like the Model T and I

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,100
work on the Model T regularly and you

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,420
know it's one of the best parts of the

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,630
museum you work on this exact one right

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,490
yeah and are you restoring it or what

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,259
are you working actually this is a build

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,170
a Model T program and what we do is we

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,940
disassemble this car in the morning and

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,800
that's before the museum opens and then

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,689
throughout the day we invite guests to

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,699
come in and help us rebuild the car and

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,130
we do that to show them how simple the

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,140
Model T was so throughout the day from

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,269
9:30 to about 2 o'clock guests will come

15
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,679
in they'll each do a little job and

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,180
together we'll build the car it's a

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,230
hands-on experiment
