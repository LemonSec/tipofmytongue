sculpture fills with thought donations

99
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:22,690

104
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,630
out of fear<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our differences and</font>

105
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:39,789
acknowledging these fears can lead to

106
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:42,340
social change so this project began last

107
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,080
spring in Cambridge Massachusetts out of

108
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,409
my daily interaction with a homeless

109
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">community each morning homeless people</font>

110
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,570
lined the streets of central square as I

111
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,850
walked to school they had already been

112
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,940
out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> streets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hours by the time</font>

113
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was headed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> school one woman always</font>

114
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">called me bunkie back back while another</font>

115
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,460
homeless man would always smile and wait

116
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,739
telling me have a wonderful morning

117
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:13,000
these are my<font color="#E5E5E5"> people my morning community</font>

118
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,850
yet our lives are so very different it

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,760
was heartbreaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to see day</font>

120
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:22,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">after day passerby completely ignore</font>

121
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,039
these people in their situation why do

122
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,900
we ignore homeless people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we</font>

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,850
frightened of the homeless<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we</font>

124
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,120
frightened by our differences or by our

125
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,310
shocking similarities what if there is a

126
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,200
way to shine light on homeless people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

127
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,330
their plight without the fears

128
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,760
associated with actually speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one</font>

129
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,130
which causes people to shut down and

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,610
ignore<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem stifling social</font>

131
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:49,630
change thus the concept of invisible was

132
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:52,419
born my goal was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create a sculpture</font>

133
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,590
to reach people make a statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

134
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:58,299
inner worlds

135
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,640
inspire compassion for others to concept

136
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,010
stood out for me the first was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt</font>

137
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,320
invisible should be human centered she

138
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,789
humans shaped to get people emotionally

139
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,500
invested<font color="#E5E5E5"> I experimented with different</font>

140
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,020
representations of humans sitting lying

141
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,630
down standing but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no question</font>

142
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,549
for me that it had to be human because

143
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,469
that is the element that invites and

144
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,100
intrigues people to come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and take a</font>

145
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:26,880
closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> look the second concept was I</font>

146
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,320
felt invisible needed to be transparent

147
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would come into play later in the</font>

148
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,840
design but I had this concept from the

149
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:37,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning to help guide me here are some</font>

150
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,729
early sketches I knew I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

151
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,450
closer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an emotional design response</font>

00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,040
because my emotions<font color="#E5E5E5"> were responding</font>

153
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:48,400
trust your instincts in your community

154
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,370
feedback I sketched until I got what I

155
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,929
was looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I then mocked up a rough</font>

156
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:57,820
idea of the sculpture just using

157
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:59,650
cardboard and saran wrap in full support

158
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,800
of hackaday in the open source community

159
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I began looking for human shapes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

160
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">in existence why reinvent the wheel as I</font>

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,140
searched around four different 3d models

162
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,450
of bodies I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came across this mannequin</font>

163
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:16,960
made by fab lab using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Autodesk</font>

164
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,659
software 1 2 3 d make and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I loved its</font>

165
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:24,159
aesthetic feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I especially love the</font>

166
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:26,470
slant of the layers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cardboard this</font>

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,810
gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place to start I pulled the</font>

168
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,370
Autodesk file into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rhino because that</font>

169
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,559
was the best program for me to

170
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,310
manipulate the files and I plan to do a

171
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,349
lot of manipulating I knew I wanted the

172
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,179
sculpture to be transparent so my

173
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,220
challenge was to tweak the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape to be</font>

174
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,620
so it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hollow and take out as</font>

175
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,890
many layers as possible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the</font>

176
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:50,200
sculpture open and feeling i took out

177
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,260
ninety percent of the layers i added

178
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,960
arms legs a neck and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a head to create a</font>

179
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,960
body position of hopelessness and being

180
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,360
invisible all the while thinking of how

181
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to feel as they saw the</font>

182
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,450
sculpture because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so many</font>

183
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,900
layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also added vertical supports to</font>

184
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,510
a common

185
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,670
the changes I then laser-cut this

186
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,230
iteration in cardboard just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

187
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,410
everything fit together and was

188
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,540
structurally sound with phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

189
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,850
invisible complete<font color="#CCCCCC"> its it was now time</font>

190
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,750
to explore how invisible would interact

191
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:29,740
with people this brings me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my second</font>

192
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:32,920
point usability the best designs are

193
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,320
intuitive to use if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

194
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone how to use your product then you</font>

197
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:47,200
also a sign telling you to push or pull

198
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:49,270
it we've all<font color="#CCCCCC"> been that person tugging</font>

199
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,670
and pushing over and over again on the

200
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,710
door in the wrong direction and a flow

207
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,310
has so many models but look at how

208
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,050
intuitive this one is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no sign</font>

209
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,079
telling you to put your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

put your hands in there yet you know to

put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands in with a gentle shape of</font>

the opening and it's called the air

213

blade which signals you to move your

214

hands out slowly even though there are

215
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:36,579
no instructions take the toilet wand if

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,620
it were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> functional you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could just</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody does that because it's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">disgusting the first toilet brush</font>

220
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,220
designs added a stick which was a

221
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,750
welcome improvement but then someone

222
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,880
really thought through the toilet

223
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,990
cleaning process and sorted out all the

224
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,300
gross parts here's a toilet<font color="#CCCCCC"> one with a</font>

229
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:14,350
over a sponge completely intuitive to

230
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:16,510
use and decorative this is another

231
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,790
project of mine i<font color="#E5E5E5"> created a Tai Chi</font>

dodecahedron

234

there are five floating dodecahedron at

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,400
various<font color="#CCCCCC"> heights surrounding an empty</font>

learn you quickly learn to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move towards</font>

241
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,220
each orb to lead your meditation motion

242
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,950
they can be set for various programs to

243
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:50,900
represent various Tai Chi routines once

again intuitive to use back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> invisible</font>

245
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,569
I needed a way to draw people towards

246
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,100
the sculpture while I accomplish this

247
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,290
with the first step in designing the

248
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,720
body shape and transparent materials I

249
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,319
now needed to find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

250
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,610
to add their notes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sculpture I</font>

251
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,830
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a sign next to the</font>

252
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,930
sculpture with instructions or literally

253
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it like a panhandler holding a sign</font>

254
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I felt that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would limit people's</font>

255
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,430
interpretations of the project so

256
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,460
instead I experimented with etching

257
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,620
words onto the chest plate I designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

258
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,400
chestplate that asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question what</font>

259
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:30,920
makes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel invisible at first I</font>

260
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,740
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very flowy naturally natural</font>

261
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,380
feeling chest plate with a few invisible

262
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,360
suggestions around the edges but it

263
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,540
didn't match the style of the rest of

264
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,430
the piece I then settled on a sleeker

265
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,410
looking design that allows invisible

266
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,560
suggestions to be more plentiful in

267
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,420
various sizes suggesting different<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font>

268
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,420
problems different levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of awareness</font>

269
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:58,969
and for different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people my goal was to</font>

270
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">include as little direction as possible</font>

271
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,530
as people read the chest plate they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

272
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,359
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see notes inside the sculpture</font>

273
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,300
in the opening in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chest plate to</font>

274
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,430
drop then in just one starter note is

275
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:15,170
enough is enough to give direction with

276
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,270
invisible now aesthetically drawing

277
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,459
people in and intuitively showing them

278
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:26,060
how to interact it was time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my third</font>

279
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:28,780
challenge keep your costs in check you

280
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,310
can design something amazing and truly

281
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,120
revolutionary but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's too expensive</font>

282
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,989
to make

it's not going to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mass-market</font>

284
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,010
maybe your product is so amazing that

00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:42,260
you can commit<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself to the cycle of</font>

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,040
the better off you'll be bringing your

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you already know</font>

387
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,320

392
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:31,168
these questions often who is this
