00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,659
grand prize winner is going to win 150

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,520
thousand dollars and a residency at the

all been in today the hackaday prize was

design and other generally smart

15
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:28,809
projects now it's in our third year and

16
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:32,068
the hackaday prize is synonymous<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

17
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,069
creating social change

18
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,760
Oh

19
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,820
we have a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of fun making</font>

20
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,890
these videos but we spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of extra</font>

21
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,359
nights and weekends and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sweat</font>

22
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,549
and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tears I'm doing it because</font>

23
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,140
we think it matters that's really the

24
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,600
point of the hackaday prize is to get

25
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,920
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to unlock their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skills and really</font>

26
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,960
build something that matters to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

27
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,119
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that inspires people to lead</font>

28
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,470
to meaningful change and positive change

29
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,680
in the world we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really</font>

30
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,030
successful and really lucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that on</font>

31
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,340
when we started thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

32
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hackett a prize for 2016 we wanted to</font>

33
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,030
pull in as many people from as many

34
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,380
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> skillsets as possible so we</font>

35
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually divided it up into five</font>

36
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,370
different challenges the first challenge

37
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a design your concept challenge so</font>

38
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,690
show us how you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea and</font>

39
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,850
fill it out through to an entire plan

40
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,620
and we took 20 winners from the first

41
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">round and worded them a thousand dollars</font>

42
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,250
but the hope that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would take that</font>

43
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea that concept and actually build it</font>

44
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,140
into a full project a full prototype of

45
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,539
for a full proof of concept and we saw

46
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from almost every one of those</font>

47
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,320
finalists whether they made it through

48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,300
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the final ten or not they put</font>

49
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,849
a lot of blood sweat<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tears of their</font>

50
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,230
own projects the other three rounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

51
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,480
we looked at where anything goes so

52
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,720
build anything that you want citizen

53
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:59,400
science the automation and assistive

54
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,810
technologies let's look at one of the

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,060
videos and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what the judges have to</font>

56
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,060
say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of our top 10 finalists</font>

57
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:24,189
okay the low-cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source industrial</font>

58
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,949
servomotor Mehcad we know features a 14

position feedback true closed loop

61
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:37,090
control rejects disturbances

62
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,210
in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> closed-loop position</font>

63
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:44,739

64
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:47,258
torque and user definable modes I love

65
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,389
clothes with control systems and I can

66
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:51,909
still remember the first time I built

67
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,490
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of clothes oof you know thing</font>

68
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:56,770
it was a it was like a DIY a laser

69
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,050
projector and so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the</font>

70
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard-disk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voice coils and some little</font>

71
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,770
optical sensors to provide feedback and

72
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a piece of code</font>

73
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,520
which was acting like a spring and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

74
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,859
could kind of push on it and feel the

75
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,960
force response and actually have this

76
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,599
physical system which was responding to

77
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,188
this equation that i typed in to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDE</font>

78
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,860
somewhere you know that was a really

79
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:19,449
cool experience and it just requires so

80
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,000
many steps because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

81
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">know blinking an LED it's having inputs</font>

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,750
and outputs and a loop and it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

83
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,669
fast enough and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy to</font>

84
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,500
break the hardware if your control loop

85
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,659
isn't working properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> UTEP first test</font>

86
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,639
it so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole sequence of things</font>

87
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:35,349
any one of which could cause you to kind

88
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of want to give up and so it's really</font>

89
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,009
great to see a project to come out and

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,560
hit what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be a sweet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spot</font>

91
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,879
between you know having having something

92
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,740
that's easy to use but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

93
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,270
powerful and isn't going to break the

94
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,639
bank because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they've taken a</font>

95
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,049
pretty novel approach to reuse readily

96
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,690
available components to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really</font>

97
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,210
nice product and sometimes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

98
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,069
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily dismiss simplicity I</font>

99
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,599
just found my<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents like an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino</font>

100
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,129
with like a summer motor controller on

101
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,259
it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do other stuff</font>

102
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,270
sometimes you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just execute</font>

103
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:07,139
simplicity well to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it's</font>

104
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,139
usable for lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cookies</font>

105
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:16,419
fly by itself is is another it's an

106
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:19,360
automated science platform wrapped

107
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:23,019
around in microscopic let's say

108
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:27,459
microscopy great scope and i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

109
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:31,629
might be soon but anyway um so it's all

110
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:33,429
about automating science and so it has

111
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:37,149
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like a light source</font>

112
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:39,969
interface it's God's motion control if

113
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:44,019
you need to change your aspects and it's

114
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:47,619
got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> blogging cake really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so</font>

115
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:49,509
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you can take like a series</font>

116
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:52,449
of readings and measurements over a

117
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:55,749
period of time so what I like about fly

118
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:57,610
pie is that they give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some tools for</font>

119
00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:01,469
set up and you can choose which tools

120
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:04,089
you want to build into your project and

121
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:05,558
you know they it's sort of modular<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

122
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,269
you can add the parts that you're

123
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:09,519
interested in and not the parts that you

124
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:12,459
might not need or you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can build</font>

125
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:16,209
on what you have and the idea that you

126
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:18,999
can do it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-cost wherever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

127
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:20,949
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tortilla money but also they've</font>

128
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,689
gone the extra mile to say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

129
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,800
experimental setup<font color="#CCCCCC"> passed and I don't</font>

130
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,929
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> else you've described that</font>

131
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,029
better but essentially they've got

132
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:30,518
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific experiments they can do with a</font>

133
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:32,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">setup so to do with the you know the</font>

134
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,029
wavelength and frequency of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the light</font>

135
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,009
they've got specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests to look for</font>

136
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:38,349
specific parasites and do various other

137
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:40,990
scientific testing so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

138
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,630
quite a you know taking the USB webcam

139
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,980
microscope thing to the next level and

140
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,959
actually saying it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fly to these</font>

141
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and situations the developing</font>

142
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,829
world and so on

143
00:08:51,730 --> 00:09:00,070
Becca even over<font color="#CCCCCC"> unload my electric hand</font>

144
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">/ one of the key features of the extra</font>

145
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,690
is it says which is the size of an

learning grass ups and in robotics class

166
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,750
was 15 years ago you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know these systems</font>

167
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,269
were really complicated and really sense

168
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,829
of scale have picked something up but

169
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,420
with the precision and the reliability

170
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,949
that they're showing in this video so

171
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,750
the fact that someone could actually

172
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:07,959
take these instructions and go on dope

173
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,579
this um it was pretty shocking to me and

174
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:12,040
the video you can see the Creator

175
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:14,439
putting the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> together it you</font>

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,079
know in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> lapse but still 26 minutes</font>

177
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,139
to put the whole hand together and I

178
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,029
also like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that there's a force</font>

179
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:23,800
feedback or at least motion feedback

180
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,779
control so if you grip something to hand

181
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,430
knows that it's you know crypt down I

182
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:32,519
think that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new feature</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

183
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,519
I hadn't seen in sort of DIY prosthetics

184
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:44,550
alright so some amazing of the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

185
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:46,170
right there we've actually built up a

186
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,579
legacy with the hackaday prize in a few

187
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,290
short years that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it so</font>

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">our grand prize winner the high greater</font>

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,240
prize winner from 2014 was sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> nogs they</font>

190
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,400
designed a satellite tracking antenna

191
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,780
that could automatically track objects

192
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,170
as they go through the sky but then

193
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,000
built the underpinnings of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

194
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,920
framework so that you can schedule time

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,300
on other people's satellite trackers in

196
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,520
their backyards and therefore thereby

197
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,290
track satellite going around the world

198
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,329
and of course the important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for</font>

199
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,040
this is it unlocks personal satellites

200
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,510
so you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your own cubesat or</font>

201
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,579
university could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cubesat</font>

202
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,140
going around the earth on but if you

203
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">only have one antenna you can only track</font>

204
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,199
it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's overhead this network</font>

205
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,150
allows other people to build them and

206
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,370
allows you to do time sharing with them

207
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,709
to track as it goes around the earth but

208
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,120
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've won they actually formed a</font>

209
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,640
foundation called the Libra Space

210
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,070
Foundation and this year that foundation

211
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,689
has published the first open hardware

212
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,100

226

wasn't connected to the mobility of

227
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:20,040
their wheelchairs and their team came up

228
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a design that is on kind of like</font>

straps over the joystick interface and

231
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,780
it doesn't obscure it so it can still be

232
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:31,380
used by caregivers but it allows them

236
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:55,220
let's take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next set of</font>

238
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,030
expensive so i made a holder and ring

239
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,700
system using a laser cutter and some

243
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,310
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you can adjust the aim up</font>

down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> left right and the ring doesn't</font>

slide around or fall off you can put

246
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,910
magnets in the holders for better

248
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,500
needed the kit lets you examine and

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,380
prototype all the common optics

250
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,790
functions such as projection

251
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,740
magnification and even advanced laser

252
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,560
effects such as the Michelson

<font color="#E5E5E5">this project is instructions and files</font>

255
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,120
to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own optics vent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using a</font>

256
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,729

257
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,240
high-end experiments fairly accessible

to anyone who has a laser cutter for me

259
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,990
what was really neat about this project

260
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,569
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's incredibly well documented it</font>

261
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,720
was easy to read all very well photo

262
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,260
documented but a lot of effort was put

263
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,670
by this team to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> their full process</font>

264
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,530
and the part of the cons it left me

265
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,060
wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run over to my laser cutter</font>

266
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,980
and make an optics bench which wasn't

267
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,560
something that I really ever had on my

268
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,240
to-do list which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of an eat</font>

269
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,010
anything for a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave the</font>

doesn't have those tools I can make this

272
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,589
so the new thing is I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

273
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,119
classrooms that wouldn't normally think

about this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say classrooms I need a</font>

00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:06,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">original controls the printed overlay is</font>

294
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,600
designed to be easily aligned and

295
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:12,529
attached to<font color="#E5E5E5"> its appliance using</font>

296
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,600
adhesives so basically it's to help

297
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:17,800
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are blind or partially</font>

298
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,079
sighted generate tactile interfaces for

299
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,490
appliances by themselves which I thought

300
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,559
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good innovation so</font>

301
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,139
essentially you stick a dollar bill on

302
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so microwave keypad was</font>

303
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:32,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">the example or anything and you scan it</font>

304
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,420
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone app and it goes off and is</font>

305
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,638
crowd-sourced for people to suggest for

306
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,099
that information look like as Braille or

307
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,379
as other symbols and it basically

308
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,110
generates using open-source software as

309
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,720
well they're using open s CAD or variant

310
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,589
of it with my believe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font>

311
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">plug-in or something to actually</font>

312
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:54,470
dynamically generate a 3d model that you

313
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,059
can 3d print and then stick on that

314
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,839
interface and then you can obviously

315
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:01,519
feel it to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's so basically</font>

316
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,689
the person you can't see as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

317
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">can hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their phone and they know</font>

318
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:05,930
roughly where the appliances they

319
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,720
effectively can get

320
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,560
think generated by themselves I think

321
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,000
one of the things that's going to make

322
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,209
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool is that they're going to</font>

323
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,460
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> a library of created interfaces</font>

324
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:19,360
for specific appliances that people can

325
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">just download and print</font>

326
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">bach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 is easy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use just plug it in</font>

327
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,200
the USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> port of your smartphone or</font>

computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Louis the software and your</font>

329
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,740
workbench is ready voxel provides

330
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,230
affordable access to an oscilloscope

331
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,240
signal generated power supply spectrum

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,680
analyzer<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor interface we all timed</font>

333
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,320
it a little bit and many other tools

334
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,609
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ways in which you can</font>

335
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,490
now replace what used to be really

336
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,110
expensive to a legging oscilloscope like

337
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,430
you you have similar processing power

338
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,950
available now on inexpensive

339
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:51,219
microcontrollers right but those aren't

340
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,290
necessarily products that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Agilent or HP</font>

341
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,210
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> tektronix are rolling out like</font>

342
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,910
they're still making like high-end stuff

343
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:00,430
and so there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real gap there i</font>

344
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for to be able within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a low-cost</font>

345
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,629
platform to provide like a lot of kind

346
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,099
of introductory tools I teach controls

347
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,730
lab courses as an engineering professor

348
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:11,649
and our urbanist is ridiculously

349
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,020
overpriced and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running into</font>

350
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,610
constraints with number of students that

351
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,790
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can physically put into the lab</font>

352
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:21,369
situation so if i can say by this<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

353
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">source hardware widget and plug it in</font>

354
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:26,169
your phone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the lab remotely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

355
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,400
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have benefits and more</font>

356
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,140
than one way because students get to

357
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,900
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their own time in that way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

358
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,820
not just kind of a two hour lab you know

359
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,820
fake hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> on today</font>

360
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,469
never hold an object and an angle to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

361
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,030
light tilting it back and forth to see

362
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,080
subtle surface details you can't see

363
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,149
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking straight at it</font>

364
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,559
you're taking advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way the</font>

365
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,860
light interacts<font color="#CCCCCC"> with those surface</font>

366
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,629
details to make them more<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily visible</font>

367
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,639
reflectance transformation imaging RTI

368
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,799
for short is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital version of this</font>

369
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,330
technique photos are then processed in

370
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,220
software to create a virtual lighting

371
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,720
model so that using the viewer you can

372
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,559
set the lighting angle to a desired

373
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,419
position to reveal details in the object

374
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,590
with my design up to 64 LEDs are

375
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,679
installed on the inside of a plastic

376
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:13,330
dome the system supports automated

377
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,610
triggering of the camera shutter in

378
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,949
synchronization with the LEDs for many

379
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,780
different makes of cameras so this

380
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,150
project I was so taken I've never really

381
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,960
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about pictures museums and how</font>

382
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:28,780
to get these detailed images and seeing

383
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,020
the photographs was really exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

384
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,250
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see I just got back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a weekend</font>

385
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,389
of camping I could see having a lot of

386
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,270
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at rocks</font>

387
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,740
differently using a device like this

388
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,809
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a neat project that now opens</font>

389
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:45,070
ups to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of others it's science</font>

390
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:46,710
and art application so yeah this seems

391
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">like really good application of</font>

392
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,640
the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's are out there and</font>

393
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,799
there's some stuff out there that you

394
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,169
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide in a novel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way and add some</font>

395
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,770
software and and now it does something

396
00:18:55,169 --> 00:19:01,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really amazing and an even more so I see</font>

397
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,629
this as being you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a unique offering</font>

398
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,770
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of open source world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

399
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't you wouldn't really see</font>

400
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,309
this from industry and if you did it

401
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,199
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be astronomically expensive it</font>

402
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,178
wouldn't be accessible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so</font>

403
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,700
yeah I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this is one of those</font>

404
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,899
projects that is both kind of

405
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,210
intellectually and practically

406
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:34,320
interesting and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really</font>

407
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-executed just a word about our</font>

408
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,260
sponsors we we had for this year

409
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">digi-key microchip atmel and our parent</font>

410
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,980
company supply frame all believed in

411
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind that this kind of competition</font>

412
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,779
could create social change so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

413
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:58,919
say thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and do a round of applause</font>

414
00:19:48,779 --> 00:20:00,690
for our sponsors so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

415
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">what our judges thought of the last</font>

416
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">three of the 10 finalists</font>

417
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,840
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you teach a five year old to play</font>

418
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,640
the harmonica well at<font color="#E5E5E5"> my kindergarten we</font>

419
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,980
use a big poster on the wall that looks

420
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,590
something like this

421
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:34,660
the teacher points to the square and

422
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:39,480
says don't ray me there's got to be a

423
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:41,510
better way so I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

424
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,550
the classroom music teaching aid

425
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:47,010
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help kids and how to play</font>

426
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:51,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the harmonica let's turn it on and see</font>

427
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:53,460
what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like this project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

428
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it started with a really focused</font>

429
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,110
problem and so you know sometimes you

430
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,790
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> project and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of trying</font>

431
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve everything all at once but this</font>

432
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,879
is a really focused problem and

433
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,500
therefore you can have a really focused

434
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,560
solution that really solves it really

435
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,320
well so in this project at creator made

436
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,700
a music teaching machine that solves a

437
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,080
problem that's pretty common right like

438
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,450
how do you explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone how to</font>

439
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,939
play a music instrument other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just</font>

440
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">by random trial and error making sounds</font>

441
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,170
with the instrument this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

442
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">student instant feedback of how they're</font>

443
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,870
put what note they're playing and have

444
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,580
one display that reminds the kid that

445
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">the note the bear plant is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same one</font>

446
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,340
the teacher is playing or different less

447
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:38,340
than see what the difference is and I

448
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,620
like I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of almost</font>

449
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,780
prosthetics anesthesia or you can have

450
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,699
these devices that you know give you

451
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,889
these extra connections between senses

452
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,600
so if you maybe would have quite have

453
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,340
made that leap on your own or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

454
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,290
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> via the kind of technological</font>

455
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,360
prop then that can help you reach

456
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,960
additional leaves that maybe you would

457
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,959
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that</font>

458
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,139
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a Moya from hunger and in this</font>

470
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,289
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> very fluid it's basically</font>

471
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:31,719
function like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> liquid metal so if we</font>

472
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:34,840
change an LVDT xylem court to a cell

accelerate the sensor the amount of

ferrofluid in a secondary coil is

476
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,230
changing it's really nice to see people

477
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,320
developing brand new sensor technology

478
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,759
in fact I don't think of all the contest

479
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,470
entries that I just I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

480
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,659
actually saw another sort of basic

481
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,340
fundamental sensor tech like this before

482
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:56,769
which made it pretty unique in addition

483
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to its actual design and so this is a</font>

484
00:22:56,769 --> 00:23:01,690
linear variable differential transformer

485
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:03,039
that uses a liquid as its core instead

486
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of iron or something like</font>

487
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,059
that it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite an ingenious idea</font>

488
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,429
it's it's simple and it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective</font>

489
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:13,450
in what it does I thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was so</font>

490
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:17,529
cool um for one thing girl fluids are

491
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,289
awesome but pretty useless for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

492
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:24,279
part I mean it's goofy and messy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

493
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:27,509
gross right I and hard to work with and

494
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:32,080
he's actually using it for something

495
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful which is really cool I liked</font>

496
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,970
watching the progress of the project

497
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,619
that it Theo they talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they</font>

498
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,659
were starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and they went all the</font>

499
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:42,889
way through publishing the abstract for

500
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:51,320
the paper that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have under review so</font>

501
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:54,530
really enjoyed that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Theta it</font>

502
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:58,429
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like much but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when it links</font>

503
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:00,830
up with the rest of it pulse things get

504
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:03,860
a little bit more interesting so I

505
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,780
initially thought this is a robot that

506
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,939
you can snap snap the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blog's together</font>

507
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,740
and out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an evil little snake but what</font>

508
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,720
I saw was it had all kinds of other

509
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,760
potential locomotion methods that I

510
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,820
hadn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even thought of crossing a little</font>

511
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,879
bridge for example or turning from a

512
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,520
snake into a wheel and these are really

513
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">neat trying to figure out ways to get to</font>

514
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,740
place with the robots otherwise can't I

515
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:29,360
really thought I could also follow along

516
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,670
the set of build surgeons and easily

517
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,260
build one of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I imagine</font>

518
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,820
going to meet up with mine and meeting

519
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,990
up with people who have 20 others we

520
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,780
connect them together and make super

521
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,640
robots and the thing about ditto that's

522
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,350
so cool is number one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

523
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,980
multi-million dollar research lab that

524
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:48,050
did it and to like just all of it it's

525
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,270
clear that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just run that robot all</font>

526
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,070
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like the number of</font>

527
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,540
different things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those modules are</font>

528
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,510
doing in the videos like they have

529
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:00,050
sliding down inclines climbing up stairs

530
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,610
like detaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reattaching or like</font>

531
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:05,360
figuring out how they can go up or down

532
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,159
and in our research group when people

533
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,659
make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> robots it's like they're really</font>

534
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited when it works once and they make</font>

535
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,110
a video<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and they're write a paper</font>

536
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,300
about it kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> overkill and and this</font>

537
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,740
ditto robot seems like they're just kind

538
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,020
of like goofing off and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

539
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,800
out and learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do different things</font>

540
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,800
with the robot

541
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:35,389
some truly amazing top 10 finalists so I

542
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,530
loved those videos and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the best</font>

543
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,120
part of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos was hearing what</font>

544
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,980
the judges had to say we're really

545
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,840
fortunate when you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a huge</font>

546
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,170
engineering initiative like this and you

547
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,669
specifically target a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

548
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,340
themes you need a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

549
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,750
experts and we reached out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

550
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,389
community that kind of surrounds

551
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,060
hackaday and we had overwhelming

552
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,890
response from these judges 14 of them

553
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,379
who donated to their time and their

554
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,090
talents not just to judge but then to

555
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,560
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos like this and to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to us</font>

556
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how the contest was going and then</font>

557
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">even just show up today we actually have</font>

558
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,830
five judges here with us today we have

559
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">akiba we have peak dr we have crystal</font>

560
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:17,419
Gordon we have Kathryn Scott and we have

561
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> krasna whoo-hoo I had to look I</font>

562
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,810
look over some for some advice there

563
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,400
sorry about this so let's uh let's have

564
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:28,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big round of applause for our judges</font>

565
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:30,620
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are here today and we love to delay</font>

566
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,000
and we'd love to make it the intensity

567
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,300
go up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more but I think it's</font>

568
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,980
actually time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start revealing who the</font>

569
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:46,460
winners are so presenting the fifth

570
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:49,370
place award is<font color="#CCCCCC"> akiva ok but can akiba is</font>

571
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:52,010
an MIT research affiliate he's got free

572
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:54,290
clag's labs wireless he's an amazing

573
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:58,430
breakdancer and I'd probably say some

574
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:00,649
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff too oh hi everyone oh I'm a</font>

575
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:06,680
key ball I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> honored to be one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

576
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:08,150
2016 hackaday prize judges um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will not</font>

577
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:21,500
delay any further I'm going to try and

578
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:23,180
open this envelope see aha the the fifth

579
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,740
place winner was a finalist in two

580
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:31,820
categories anything goes and automation

581
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually I was one of the judges for</font>

582
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,090
this project and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

583
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:39,240
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing a lot of people are used to</font>

584
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:41,340
stepper motors in their lives they run

585
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,000
our CNC machines they run our 3d

586
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,889
printers and they're cheap when people

587
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,720
will say servos they think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> hobby</font>

588
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,390
servos like little ones that you use to

589
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,510
drive RC cars during or things like that

590
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,370
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually there's a class of motors</font>

591
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,410
called industrial servos which are

592
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,689
amazing and they're expensive so

593
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,910
industrial servos they're very high

594
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,010
torque very high speed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a low power</font>

595
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,750
and there are also hundreds of dollars

596
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,090
so they're out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the price range of</font>

597
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,710
most hobbyists or<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are just</font>

598
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:14,159
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> designing something that</font>

599
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:20,420
is that you can actually sell for less

600
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:23,700
than like 30 thousand dollars so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40</font>

601
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:29,880
for the fifth place on the 2016 hackaday

602
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:33,300
prize award the prize goes to make a do

603
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:37,190
we know by joseph church at tropical

604
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,190
labs Oh is he is he in the house

605
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:49,580
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mehcad we know created an adapter</font>

606
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:51,769
board to convert a servo to convert-- to

607
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,139
convert-- a standard stepper motor which

608
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:56,929
is very cheap like on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the order of ten</font>

609
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:58,728
or twenty dollars to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a servo motor which</font>

610
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:00,679
is expensive on the order of three

611
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:02,899
hundred to a thousand or probably a

612
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,539
couple thousand dollars it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna hope</font>

613
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:10,369
it'll probably open up a new servos to a

614
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:15,158
new class of hobbyists<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh okay oh and</font>

615
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:26,959
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so thank you thank you</font>

which is designer on concept and they

640
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,399
kept working on their project up until

641

best uses of ferrofluid anyone has ever

643
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,450
seen and it's extremely accurate which

644
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,040
is highly important in sensors these

645
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,929
guys were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolt this thing to a</font>

project called a new hire creative sense

659
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,059
or in which I developed a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,439
measurement sensor with which also can

661
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:48,749
be measured used to measure acceleration

662
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,960
I've got two functioning motors or
