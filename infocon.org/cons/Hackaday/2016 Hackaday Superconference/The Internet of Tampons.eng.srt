00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">something say that most people don't</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">through our journey about innovating in</font>

17
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:17,060
women's health which we've seen a huge

dearth of generally throughout history

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,030
until recently more specifically we will

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,009
talk about the shattering of the uterus

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean awkwardness lining because</font>

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:30,979
there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stigma around this</font>

23
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,090

throughout history how can tech help is

26
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:40,729
it even relevant what my flow is and

27
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:44,209
what challenges do we face so first

28
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:46,789
let's ask why is this something that we

29
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:49,369
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of last year I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> texting</font>

someone just had to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> them that it</font>

31
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,390
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time of the month I have my</font>

33
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,970
got tampon misspelled and autocorrect

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,110
did not know that that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a word that</font>

35
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:05,179
they needed to suggest to me however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">males even use first and only suggestion</font>

39
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,730
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that you know we</font>

40
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a lot not to</font>

as the curse for a lot of reasons from

43
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,459
frustration to constant leakage and

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:29,109
staining sexual stigma and thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

48
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,299
this looked like throughout history<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:45,390
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early days women were banished to</font>

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,650
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> history they decided that ok you can</font>

allowed women more functionality but it

60
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,459
wasn't until 1929 that people thought

61

why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know go to the</font>

French for buffer was invented and

65
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:32,070

66
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,680
however in the 70s and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s when Tampax</font>

were not saturated enough it's

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,000
uncomfortable so they came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with one</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is extra absorbent and stayed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

four days that however hard word great

breeding ground for bacterial infection

76
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,489
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of women ended up receiving</font>

amputations from spread infections and

78
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:05,940
also a lot ended up dying so now every

79
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,950

84
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,890
during their periods is a menstrual cup

in China<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is for religious and</font>

signify that it is connected

start transmitting data to our phone to

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,510
the phone where you can then set

152
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,760
notifications so your phone can tell you

153
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,440
oh you're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty five fifty eighty</font>

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,490
and that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does you can't just</font>

157
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,510
at the long-term trends of your data so

158
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,810
you can look at your average you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

159
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,580
look at your current monthly flow and

160
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,170
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using it it stores on</font>

161
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,880
this keychain so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it around</font>

162
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:59,140
until you next need it our app also has

163
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,300
some pretty cool features that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you about so it actually learns</font>

your flow it uses machine learning to be

166
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,950
able to predict a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so first</font>

167
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,870
of all it can predict time until removal

168
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,550
which we've found is a really big pain

169
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,770
point as amanda was saying earlier with

170
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,310
our customers you know if you're walking

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,490
can sit through inception that's fine or

174
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,960
like Oh an hour and a half I don't want

175

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,610
just go now and change it you can also

178
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,080
predict the timing of your cycle there

179
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,599
are a lot of apps right now that do this

180
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,760
there's guess there's clue there's a lot

181
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,020
more that I'm not going to mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

182
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,150
of them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was a time where to</font>

183
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,670
log your fitness data you would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

184
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:51,640
your phone and you would write<font color="#CCCCCC"> in okay I</font>

185
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,890
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> um 30 minutes of moderate exercise</font>

186
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,230
and they would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh this is how many</font>

190

ourselves like a data monkey so we

191
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:05,300
figure it's time that we give the period

192

the same

194
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:14,269
is an awesome database of menstrual

195
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:16,670
information so eighty-two percent of our

196
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,680
potential customers have said that they

197
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,240
would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have their data aggregated</font>

198
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,399
anonymously so it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to know when your tampons fold</font>

article more specifically um the author

225
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,949
mentions that you know maybe she's never

226

been more wrong maybe these connected

products push ahead human progress and

228
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,880
innovation she then goes on to

229
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,070
potentially compare us to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

230
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,170
invention of electricity that that was

231
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,240
pretty freaky when you know there was a

<font color="#CCCCCC">Lightning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming down onto a key from a</font>

that vegan consumer product but

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,399
potentially women's health is

236
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,790
experiencing that revolution right now

237
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,040
and we're in taught in kind very scared

238
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,959
and maybe it'll become like Jacob

239
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,319
mentioned just like another track

240
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:17,300
phenomenon like sleep so

241
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,589
there's a why here there's a reason why

242
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,899
we're doing this we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

243
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:22,520
we've talked about what's happened but

244
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,589
you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

245
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have is you know why is this even</font>

246
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:30,560
important and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address that so</font>

247
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,270
yes we are creating at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

248
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,040
day a consumer product<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a thing you</font>

249
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,880
go and you buy and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have it and</font>

250
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,640
the store has money great but what we're

251
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,830
also doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating data now what is</font>

252
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,660
data do it illuminates problems that we

253
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,270
don't know about it brings things into

254
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,490
the light from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the darkness and I want</font>

255
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:53,050
to talk a little bit about what being in

256
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:58,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the darkness has meant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for ministration</font>

257
00:11:53,050 --> 00:12:01,430
so medically right now the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> rigorous</font>

258
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,040
way of measuring a woman's or anybody's

259
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,930
menstrual flow is to have them use a pad

260
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,279
and then when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done with it you</font>

261
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,229
take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you weigh it and you say</font>

262
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's you know it's about you know</font>

263
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,490
30 milliliters of blood I guess they

264
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,230
they menstruated and there's no way of

265
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,670
knowing Oh were they heavy at the

266
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,020
beginning and they taper it off at the

267
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">end there's no way of being able to</font>

268
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,800
really get fine information at this data

269
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,589
and that's the most rigorous it gets

270
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,969
below that there's literally just taking

271
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:28,220
the pad and this is a real method

272
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:32,810
looking at it and saying yeah 30

273
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,490
milliliters probably and this is you

274
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we sleep for thirty-three percent</font>

275
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,320
of our lives right menced raiders men

276
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,589
straight on average for 6.5 percent in

277
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,420
their lives and yet the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

278
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,130
we have on sleep is orders of magnitude

279
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,020
greater than the amount we have on

280
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,339
menstruation this is as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amanda said it's</font>

281
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,810
something that affects have the

282
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,060
population the world for half their

283
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,899
lives and its really pretty ridiculous

284
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,849
that considering a hysterectomy 'he's

285
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">IUDs birth control pills all these</font>

286
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,230
procedures devices and drugs that affect

287
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,770
menstruation we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any way of</font>

288
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,470
quantifying how they do that so that's

289
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to address</font>

290
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,459
innovation right now at least until<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

291
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of innovation in</font>

292
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,300
this sector and it's partly because of

293
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stigma against demonstration and</font>

294
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,959
it's partly because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of</font>

295
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,640
data around it and really it's hard to

296
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,219
separate the two that's another thing we

297
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,959
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact so we want to create data</font>

298
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,680
that allows people to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this</font>

299
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,719
sector

300
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,109
and and create things themselves we want

301
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,490
to make this more accessible and lastly

302
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,770
and most importantly we want to address

303
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,990
stigma because that's kind of at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

304
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:42,920
root of all of this because it's my

305
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,649
personal belief<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I have on my</font>

306
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,660
phone right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here for like every night I</font>

307
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:49,730
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> slept for the past couple years how</font>

308
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:53,510
long I've slept and what the quality of

309
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,670
sleep was I have similar data for the

310
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,370
number of steps I've taken and a lot of

311
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">people do and once we can say the same</font>

312
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,480
thing about menstruation what it can be

313
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,339
another app that you put on your phone

314
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,140
and it's sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there right next to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

315
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:09,050
your other bodily functions maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

316
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,550
will be able to to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize this</font>

317
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,069
isn't some like disgusting horrible

318
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,199
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to like erase from</font>

319
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,810
the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> conscious besides to like</font>

320
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,250
make weird jokes about in movies maybe

321
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,199
this is just another normal biological

322
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,170
phenomenon we can start to accept it

323
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,740
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really this gets to a</font>

324
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,599
deeper issue of that there are things we

325
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,420
know and there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that</font>

326
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,680
we don't know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most dangerous are</font>

327
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,969
the things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know we don't know</font>

328
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,760
the unknown unknowns and as much as I am

329
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">gung-ho</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about menstrual innovation now a</font>

330
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,339
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago before I started working here</font>

331
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:48,500
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> day to day basis I didn't know that</font>

332
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,950
menstruation even existed it didn't

333
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,870
cross my mind at all so there's this

334
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem where we have you know knowing</font>

335
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,970
things and then outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

336
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,640
menstruations over there and there are a

337
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,920
lot of benefits to bring this into the

338
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,689
the realm of what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> known and yeah</font>

339
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,719
there's stuff like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking</font>

340
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">about there's bringing people in making</font>

341
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,440
them feel included having everybody's

342
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,070
problems out on the table or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

343
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,529
problems having everybody's experiences

344
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,829
out on the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can all share in</font>

345
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:23,060
them but there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more I mean</font>

346
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:26,170
we're all hackers right we're all here

347
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:29,180
cuz we like to build really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool things</font>

348
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,459
I've done the I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a pretty</font>

349
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,899
nice array of stuff and the work I've

350
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,310
been doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> past year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

351
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,100
of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting I've ever done</font>

352
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,510
like working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the human body</font>

353
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,250
dissecting what's okay and what's not to

354
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">do in terms of FDA regulations and</font>

355
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,859
safety

356
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:46,099
working with the specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> phenomenon</font>

357
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:48,649
it's been really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting and putting</font>

358
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,449
this into the the space of not unknown

359
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,009
unknowns allows us all to share in that

360
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,969
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alta to solve these really</font>

361
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:58,040
interesting problems not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

362
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,350
in this space that's neglected there is

363
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">huge opportunity for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a smart</font>

364
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,299
entrepreneur to come along and create a

365
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,189
device and make a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money by</font>

366
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:11,089
improving the quality of life of a lot

367
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people so whatever year your reason</font>

368
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:14,779
is for wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's plenty</font>

369
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found there and the really</font>

370
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:20,299
interesting thing is that once you merge

371
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,709
these two you know you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great</font>

372
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:23,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">ministrations part of the known space</font>

373
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:26,839
now the question that you then have to

374
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,790
ask is what other unknown unknowns are

375
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,519
out there what other spaces are just

376
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,199
waiting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be opened up so we can we can</font>

377
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,119
start to explore them and start to see

378
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,769
what problems they present and start to

379
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:42,769
capitalize on audiences that want help

380
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:44,869
well for those spaces as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as for</font>

381
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:47,829
menstruation it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> bloody time</font>

382
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,829
thank
