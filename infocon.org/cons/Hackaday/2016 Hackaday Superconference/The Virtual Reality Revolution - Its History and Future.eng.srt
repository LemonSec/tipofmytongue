virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality 3d interaction and</font>

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,809
wearable computing which means I'm

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,670
probably going to invite you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk it</font>

9
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:49,309
a meet up here probably in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

10
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,050
couple months or so his work combines an

11
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,239
engineering approach of building

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,610
technical artifacts with a scientific

13
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,010
approach of experimentation and user

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,080
evaluation he is currently associate

USC Institute for Creative Technologies

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,610
and all handed over to you did it good

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,080
afternoon good evening wherever we had

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of a transition thanks for the</font>

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,259
introduction I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> David crumb going to</font>

21
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,799
talk a little bit about the role that my

22
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:19,820
lab played in sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new</font>

23
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,560
revolution or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Renaissance where do we</font>

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,289
want to call it in virtual reality that

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,759
we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of are experiencing these days</font>

26
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:31,969
it's pretty interesting and exciting i'm

27
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,829
associate lab director at a small lab at

28
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:38,839
the Institute<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Creative Technologies</font>

29
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:40,669
it's part of USC and we do work for the

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,770
military we do work for companies and

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,399
things like that looking at training and

32
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning and other ways to use</font>

33
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology in new and interesting ways</font>

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,249
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great to be in pasadena</font>

35
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:54,740
talking about virtual reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

36
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:57,020
undergraduate here over at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caltech</font>

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,089
institution and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always think of</font>

38
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pasadena as a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where there's a</font>

39
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,490
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff goes on Rose Parade</font>

40
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,619
things like that but there's a couple

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">little pockets of really cool</font>

42
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:09,830
engineering and science they go on and

43
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,920
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new ones so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I began</font>

44
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,020
working with virtual reality back in

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,540
1998 so you can see me with less gray

46
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,730
hair and less wrinkles today I'm still

47
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,959
building and studying new techniques and

48
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,640
technologies to improve virtual reality

49
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,920
so in the last few years we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen some</font>

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,940
really amazing new developments in

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,040
virtuality and augmented

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,040
reality and so this path that we're

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,690
taking as a society towards virtual

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,120
reality has been really a wild and

55
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,579
exciting over the last few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my</font>

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,740
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> journey like I said began almost 20</font>

57
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,650
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on any journey it's</font>

58
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,330
important to sort of sometimes you know

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,900
look around look up look around and see

60
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,880
where we've come from and how far we

61
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,200
come and where we're going to so I'm

62
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:01,680
hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about that</font>

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:04,410
today so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is virtual reality so for</font>

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,020
me virtual reality is not really about

65
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,060
the gear right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not or at least not</font>

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,350
about a particular set of gear so it

67
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,240
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily mean it's a</font>

68
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,470
head-mounted display that you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it</font>

69
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,790
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily mean a certain</font>

70
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,720
number of pixels it doesn't mean a

71
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:22,890
certain refresh rate for me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:25,829
about the goal right the goal is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font>

73
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,559
a feeling to people that there someplace

74
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,720
you're right or they're interacting with

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,780
something it's whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of</font>

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,910
technology or pieces of software to help

77
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,570
you experience a synthetic kind of a

78
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:42,420
computer facilitated environment and we

79
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,480
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks in science fiction</font>

80
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in literature playing with this</font>

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,560
where the level of virtuality is so

82
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,850
amazing that people can't tell the

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,850
difference between the real world and

84
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,260
the virtual world and<font color="#CCCCCC"> where of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course as</font>

85
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,519
you probably know we're nowhere near

86
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,470
that in in the real world and a real

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,780
world level of technology and for me

88
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,459
that's actually okay it's not really

89
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,140
useful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

90
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,610
perfect virtual world that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

91
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,010
tell the difference it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great</font>

92
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,380
for as a science fiction trope or a

93
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,630
philosophical discussion but it's not

94
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,839
really practical to think about on the

95
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,850
day-to-day basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes I talk about</font>

96
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">when i talk about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i talk about two</font>

97
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,990
experiments that i've read about in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

98
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,640
literature and many years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago some</font>

99
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,650
researcher came up with his experiment

100
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,870
where he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give people a virtual</font>

101
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,659
candy bar<font color="#E5E5E5"> and compare that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a real</font>

102
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,390
candy bar so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the guys in all the</font>

103
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,730
participants into virtuality headset and

104
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,650
to pretend to eat a virtual chocolate

105
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,240
bar that you could see it in the rule in

106
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,799
the virtual world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you could</font>

107
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretend to take a bite of it and then</font>

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,770
you would have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know do the</font>

109
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,659
same thing in the real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

110
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,280
candy bar and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course yeah you know</font>

111
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference between the two one</font>

112
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,539
tastes good the other is you're

113
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,520
pretending right so your conscious mind

114
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,640
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not fooled at all right and</font>

115
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,010
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the point of</font>

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of experiment is but there's</font>

117
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,420
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> study that was done by Germany</font>

118
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,979
balancing up at Stanford he's at

119
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,650
Stanford now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he did this when he</font>

120
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,870
was at Santa Cruz but he did some work

121
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,760
looking at a virtual character in the

122
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,490
space and would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people walk around</font>

123
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,200
the character and you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk</font>

124
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,840
behind the character to read a sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

125
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,969
that characters back and he looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

126
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the path of how people walked around it</font>

127
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,450
and for some of the virtual characters

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,310
he made them absolutely still and they

129
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,840
didn't move at all some of them he<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave</font>

130
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">them a little bit aliveness or I gave</font>

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,109
them the ability to track with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eyes</font>

132
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,349
were there watching the user and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

133
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">more realistic it was the more distance</font>

134
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,770
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were unconsciously giving</font>

135
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,480
that character as I walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that</font>

136
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,849
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't a real</font>

137
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,440
person but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were influenced at some</font>

138
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,180
level and maybe a subconscious or

139
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,980
unconscious level to like oh that's

140
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,060
that's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a person so I'm going</font>

141
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give them a little more personal</font>

142
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,040
space so you know we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font>

143
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,830
virtual reality but if I can fool parts

144
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,900
of your mind at certain levels yeah i'm

145
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,190
i'm presenting you some kind of reality

146
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,530
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were acting too so you're</font>

147
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,840
reacting as if that character is more

148
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:14,260
real and that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be done</font>

149
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:16,419
today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool so another</font>

150
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,380
take on virtual reality is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

151
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you that virtual</font>

152
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,190
reality must replicate or replace the

153
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,170
century signals from the world world you

154
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,210
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect visual</font>

155
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,160
signals and perfect audio you should

156
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,140
also add touch and smell maybe even

157
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,340
taste and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really isn't</font>

158
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,200
practical and all the times it's not

159
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,849
really necessary like in my role we're

160
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,409
trying to do military training sometimes

161
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,330
we're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach students about</font>

162
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,100
things you know created these learning

163
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,270
environments and sometimes like you're

164
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,960
learning something it doesn't matter

165
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:46,479
what the what it tastes like right and

166
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,859
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any case there's a lot more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,750
senses right these are the ones that we

168
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,140
learn in school but

169
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,770
is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so kind of a measure of</font>

170
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,870
acceleration which is part of our

171
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">vestibular system there's proprioception</font>

172
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,490
where we know where our body extremities

173
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,979
are in relation to to the rest of the

174
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,540
body we have the ability to sense

175
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">temperature we have the ability to sense</font>

176
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,390
pain we have sort of a sense of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

177
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:13,180
you know these don't map really well too

178
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,070
you know some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of transducer so a</font>

179
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,320
lot of times you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need these these</font>

180
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,730
other senses I just really depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

181
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the environment is and what you're</font>

182
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to train people with or what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

183
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:29,650
want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to experience so to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

184
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:32,409
the important aspect of virtual reality

185
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,419
is providing what are called sensory

186
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,970
motor contingencies and these are

187
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:39,849
sensory signals that arise from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

188
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,810
interaction of what the person is doing

189
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,790
and their senses so for example if I

190
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,580
look at a picture or I look at a slide

191
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's a slide there if I move around</font>

192
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,620
and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it in different ways right</font>

193
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,530
it's still there and it doesn't change

194
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,450
but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

195
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,210
the oculus rift the very first version

196
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,159
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had tracking on it but it was only</font>

197
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,020
orientation tracking right so if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

198
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,550
it put this helmet on and I could see

199
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,469
part of the virtual world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if i turn</font>

200
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,180
my head<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would see this part of the</font>

201
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,979
virtual world art or I turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> around right</font>

202
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,770
and I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm looking around the</font>

203
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:20,260
world right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so looking around instead of</font>

204
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:22,659
just at something but so there was some

205
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,550
limited sensorimotor contingency there

206
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,990
right because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I rotated my head but</font>

207
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,729
if I moved my head side to side that

208
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,740
first version right<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't tracking that</font>

209
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:32,130
side-to-side movement so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I move side</font>

210
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,200
to side nothing happened right so it was

211
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,789
incomplete in some ways right so later

212
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,620
versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> the oculus rift had that with</font>

213
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,750
the camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up and so you would have</font>

214
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,669
motion parallax so I would see objects

215
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,440
sort of move around in relation to each

216
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,520
other as a move side to side and that's

217
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great and important so it's</font>

218
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,569
really important for to think of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

219
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">a really important in virtual reality</font>

220
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,160
that sensory motor loop so the

221
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,160
environment should react to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in that</font>

222
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,990
way

223
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,480
other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that increase that sense of</font>

224
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,899
presence that that you have in that that

225
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,190
new place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that virtual place is having</font>

226
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,050
the environment react to your actions

227
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and react to your presence so being able</font>

228
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up and move something being able</font>

229
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,258
to effect change in that world you might

230
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,360
not have touch but maybe you can use

231
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:19,329
pinch gloves or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> button or something to</font>

232
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,560
pick up something and moving it around

233
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:22,878
you might leave footprints in the

234
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment as you walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around and</font>

235
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,870
seeing those footprints left behind you

236
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:30,019
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> give some meaning to your existence</font>

237
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,819
some some trace of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your presence</font>

238
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,019
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> actions have consequences and</font>

239
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:34,849
that's really important for making

240
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:41,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">people think that they are there in a</font>

241
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:42,829
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment so I enjoy watching the</font>

242
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,720
British television series Doctor Who and

243
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:46,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">there might be a few people in this room</font>

244
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,160
who do also and they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great clip</font>

245
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:51,649
from one of the shows where they show

246
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,899
that century Motor consistency and they

247
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,360
show how<font color="#E5E5E5"> a painting a painting is a</font>

248
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,959
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a wall and it's a thing but</font>

249
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,790
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have head tracking and 3d and</font>

250
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,410
things like that that painting that is

251
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,889
no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> an object but it becomes a</font>

252
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:09,709
place and i'll show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the clip of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

253
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:14,060
and maybe some audio for this it would

254
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:15,258
be great let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we have</font>

255
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,699
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to press</font>

256
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,939
forward and if the other doesn't play

257
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:22,699
through it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but KD i've got a</font>

258
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:25,849
fright second city how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doing that</font>

259
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:28,449
how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that possible it's an oil</font>

260
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,449
painting

261
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:38,200
and 3 d-time not hard bigger on the

262
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,729
inside a so that that's one of the

263
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,180
reasons why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love doctor who is that it</font>

264
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:45,340
helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> me explain my work so we don't</font>

265
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">have 3d oil paintings but you can put on</font>

266
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:52,300
a virtual reality display and paint a 3d

267
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,430
world in apps like tilt brush so we're

268
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">not quite Time Lords but we're working</font>

269
00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:00,760
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so okay i said before let's look</font>

270
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,350
at you know look at vr a little bit

271
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,689
let's look at where we are let's look up

272
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,960
from our journey and frankly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

273
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:11,080
really live in an amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,010
wide variety of virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality headsets</font>

276
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,770
available many of them reigns from<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

277
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:20,319
the low end<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen dollars to nine</font>

278
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,449
hundred dollars the hollow lens over

279
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,920
here of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course is it's an Augmented</font>

280
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,600
Reality Display and it's two thousand

281
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,459
dollars but the tracking system<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

282
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,890
really amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's pretty much</font>

283
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,590
science fiction so that's that's it's

284
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:35,380
quite amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world we live in and</font>

285
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:38,430
there's so many new VR experiences are

286
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,200
available i mentioned tilt brush there's

explore Mars or their therapist using

295
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,589
virtual reality to treat issues like

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,750
post-traumatic stress disorder and

297
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,330
virtual reality is being used to teach

children and vision and help scientists

here you're right it's an it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing</font>

301
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,420
where we are so how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get here so</font>

303
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,740
it seemed like no one was talking about

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,600
virtual reality and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seemed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

306
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,190
of VR history but the latest boom in

307
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,740
virtuality seems to stem from the

308
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,170
introduction of the oculus rift virtual

309
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,810
reality display and it really seemed to

310
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,849
capture the attention of public and

311
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,410
inspired many different companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

312
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,839
enter the<font color="#CCCCCC"> market as competitors</font>

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,660
about two thousand twelve and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:07,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">too was a 2014 and that had that better</font>

324
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:18,699
and then in March to 2016 we have the

325
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:22,149
consumer version of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rift so where'd</font>

326
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:24,040
the rift come from so if you listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

327
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:27,040
the press releases and read the news

articles and the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they tell</font>

330
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:34,060
talent but there was a young guy named

331
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">Palmer Luckey who was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this bright young</font>

332
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,589
college student who invented the oculus

rift in a bedroom in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his parents house</font>

334
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the press will tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

335
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:43,990
a world-class engineer who figured out

336
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,759
the technical difficulties that

337
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,310
prevented virtuality from ever working

338
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,259
and ever succeeding in the past and he

339
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,768
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company launched the</font>

340
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:55,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kickstarter campaign and raised 2.4</font>

341
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,189
million dollars from consumers

342
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,319
interested in buying oculus rift and

343
00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:02,709
then he sold his company to Facebook for

344
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:04,560
two billion dollars and then there's

345
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:07,630
some other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened with</font>

346
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,258
political donations and we can talk

347
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,790
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> later maybe outside so what's</font>

348
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:15,130
my role I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of have a unique</font>

349
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,139
perspective on that part of VR history I

350
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:20,560
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of know a little bit more about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

351
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:24,399
real story palmer luckey over there and

352
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:28,089
up there he<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked in my lab from 2011</font>

353
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,949
and into 2012 you can see him on the

354
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:33,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">photo of my lab and his popular</font>

355
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:36,550
mechanics magazine cover so he wasn't

356
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a world-class engineer but he was</font>

357
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,229
a very dedicated gamer and he really

358
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,269
understood the culture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video</font>

359
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,100
gamer and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

360
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,019
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very passionate about</font>

361
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,089
virtual reality and he came to our lab

362
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:52,769
to learn more about designing a building

363
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,769
low cost for true reality displays

364
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:02,029
and I have a little rant about the

365
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,589
mythology of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> garage so a lot of you</font>

366
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:05,750
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this mythology about his</font>

367
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,699
company right so a lot of American

368
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,259
technology companies want to have that

369
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,359
special kind of creation story right the

370
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,009
mythology of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the garage it's amazing</font>

371
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,660
thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that a high-tech company</font>

372
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,220
could be started by one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

373
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,170
people in the humble environment of a

374
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,360
garage and it makes you believe that

375
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,550
anyone could become a rich successful

376
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,199
person who changes the world and it

377
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,269
can't happen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

378
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,040
and it's not if it's not the story it's

379
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:30,170
not the story and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

380
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a beautiful compelling story but</font>

381
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,009
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always not one hundred percent true</font>

382
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,380
it's a simplification at the very least

383
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:38,930
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> HP of course is one of the companies</font>

384
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has that garage myth this is the</font>

385
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">garage that they started in it's</font>

386
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,009
sometimes called the birthplace of

387
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:48,349
Silicon Valley but it's only part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

388
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:50,839
company's birth actually all the

389
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,730
prototyping or the early prototyping and

390
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,769
development happened in a lab at

391
00:15:52,730 --> 00:16:00,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stanford University and Apple is another</font>

392
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,690
company with a famous<font color="#E5E5E5"> garage story this</font>

393
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,579
this garage belonged to Steve<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jobs his</font>

394
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,260
parents who of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

395
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">co-founders long with Steve Wozniak they</font>

396
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,279
also didn't do any design here they

397
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:12,649
brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished computers here for</font>

398
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,149
testing and storage and then they would

399
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:16,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">bring the computers to the stories that</font>

400
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:18,980
would sell them so but they often

401
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:20,870
attended meetings of the homebrew

402
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,990
Computer Club which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group of</font>

403
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,120
hobbyists computers in the bay area and

404
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,920
they met at Stanford University's linear

405
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,600
accelerator center and they presented

406
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,449
their first computer there and then

407
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">later started the apple company and</font>

408
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,709
google also wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a garage</font>

409
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,139
story they did rent out this garage when

410
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:40,339
they were first starting out but when

411
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,920
they were renting this out there already

412
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:45,079
a company with a million dollars of

413
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,969
investment by the family<font color="#CCCCCC"> moved into the</font>

414
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:48,620
garage<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it really began as research</font>

415
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,970
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that Larry Page and</font>

416
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,730
Sergey Brin worked on when they were

417
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,839
graduate students at Stanford University

418
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's a lot of Stanford than this</font>

419
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,850
story but yeah other universities do

420
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,189
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> for two so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see many</font>

421
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,139
technology companies want to have that

422
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:05,030
humble origin story beginning the garage

423
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:06,900
basement bedroom whatever and it really

424
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeds into the American dream</font>

425
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,400
maybe a universal human dream right

426
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,800
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with humble beginnings and</font>

427
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,050
then with intelligence and determination

428
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,550
building a company and making a lot of

429
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,339
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then changing the world</font>

430
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:23,760
forever and also feeds into this<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

431
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,619
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there can be special whiz kids who</font>

432
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,100
can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a technology that normal</font>

433
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:31,530
people can't and the real story is of

434
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,300
course a little bit different and I'm

435
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,310
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out that right there's</font>

436
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,889
often the university research lab behind

437
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,320
the scenes that turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be vital in</font>

438
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,930
creating the company and that that lab

439
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,120
might provide education technology or

440
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:48,630
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a culture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

441
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,949
creates and shares ideas and also wanted

442
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,630
to point out it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

443
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:58,860
university lab it could be a

444
00:17:51,630 --> 00:18:01,500
well-equipped hackerspace so in the

445
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,050
story of virtuality the mixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Riley lab</font>

446
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I belong to and i work at at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> university lab behind the scenes</font>

449
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:14,129
for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the recent VR developments</font>

450
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:19,560
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple pictures of us trying to do</font>

451
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:20,700
work or goofing off and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe we</font>

452
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a strong influence on</font>

453
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,170
development of at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the google</font>

454
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,270
cardboard the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Samsung gear VR and of</font>

455
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">course the oculus rift at the very</font>

456
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,460
minimum we demonstrated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-cost</font>

457
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,660
virtuality was possible and that's

458
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">really important because most companies</font>

459
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,400
are really risk adverse and they won't

460
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,379
try to do new things unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know</font>

461
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
will work and they know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will buy</font>

462
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,690
it and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started the build low-cost</font>

463
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,580
virtuality displays beginning about 2010

464
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,560
and since<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the number of companies</font>

465
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,790
learned that it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done and they</font>

466
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,530
saw the Kickstarter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw that people</font>

467
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,570
were interested in it so they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

468
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,040
figure out how to do it themselves for

469
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,730
example Google cardboard came out in

470
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,760
2014 we had released a cardboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> head</font>

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">mounted display in 2012</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Samsung gear VR</font>

472
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,050
came out in 2015 and we had already

473
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,420
demonstrated smartphone-based virtuality

474
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,159
back in 2011<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also actually</font>

475
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,380
received an email from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Samsung</font>

476
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,840
research lab that thanked us for open

477
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,000
sourcing our cardboard and 3d printed

478
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,649
smartphone-based head-mounted displays

479
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,340
and the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> also thanked us for</font>

480
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,020
starting

481
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,408
on the journey<font color="#CCCCCC"> that led to the gear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VR</font>

482
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,879
of course lawyers and things like that

483
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:29,909
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't heard anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then so</font>

484
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and of course we hired and</font>

485
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:33,870
trained<font color="#E5E5E5"> Palmer Luckey you started the</font>

oculus<font color="#E5E5E5"> VR company and later became part</font>

487
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,918
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook so as you can see we've been</font>

488
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,580
thinking about low cost for trial

489
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:45,600
displays long before oculus and Google

490
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:48,230
and Samsung and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really because</font>

491
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,399
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> army came to us until 2011</font>

492
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,710
we've been thinking about beforehand but

493
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,289
when they came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us in 2011 they told</font>

494
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,059
us hey virtual reality headsets cost too

495
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:59,520
much money and they couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford the</font>

496
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">train every pilot and every soldier if</font>

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,730
he mounted displays cost ten thousand

498
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,289
dollars or twenty thousand dollars each

499
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then we really wanted us to figure</font>

500
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:08,429
out how to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the economics and we</font>

501
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:11,130
did end up changing the economics in a

502
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:14,850
way in disrupting the entire VR economy

503
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,230
by inspiring a bunch of companies to

504
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,299
compete<font color="#E5E5E5"> with each other to build</font>

505
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,980
low-cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> redraw this place for the</font>

506
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,020
consumer market<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course in hindsight</font>

507
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,880
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow we're geniuses but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet we</font>

508
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,889
were trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something and it</font>

509
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,250
turned out this way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't take all</font>

510
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:32,100
the credit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take a step back in</font>

511
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,690
virtuality history again so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

512

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,210
he hired<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that work at ICT he's now</font>

515
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:44,340
working at Microsoft on the hollow lens

516
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,409
and this is the head mounted display

517
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,899
that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with back in the</font>

518
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:51,090
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> back at NASA Ames back up in the Bay</font>

519
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">Area about in the 1980s and he was</font>

520
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,799
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a guy named Scott Fischer</font>

521
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,260
who's also a professor at USC this

522
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:01,559
display I found it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Smithsonian</font>

523
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Museum in the air and space museum one</font>

524
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,940
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their in Space museums in Washington</font>

525
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">DC and you know as we get older we think</font>

526
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,880
back to stuff we worked on in grad

527
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,190
school and to know that it's in the

528
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,890
museum in some ways is super depressing

529
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,510
because that means we're old so you know

530
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,640
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> might feel that way a little bit too</font>

531
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,379
but also you know at least it's a

532
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,580
Smithsonian<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming you know it's not too</font>

533
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not too shabby so mark founded the</font>

534
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,030
company in the 80s called fakes face and

535
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,049
he started continued to the VR displays

536
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,678
including this one called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wide 5</font>

537
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,320
which has to really know

538
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,629
for a really wide field of view about a

539
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,700
150 degree field of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> and up until a</font>

540
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:42,309
few years ago like 60 degrees was the

541
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,869
biggest that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever encountered 90</font>

542
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:47,499
degrees is what the oculus rift gives

543
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:50,230
you so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much bigger it is a sixty</font>

544
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:51,990
thousand dollar display so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has really</font>

545
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,009
unique optics and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

546
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,990
manufacturing technique so there's one

547
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:57,129
guy you can build them and if he's not

548
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling right guy he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

549
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,379
build them but you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get them</font>

550
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:01,240
anymore because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he doesn't build them</font>

551
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:02,740
anymore he's doing other stuff but yeah

552
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:08,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">sixty thousand dollars way too much</font>

553
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:11,200
money so in 2010 when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone 4 came</font>

554
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:13,360
out with the high<font color="#CCCCCC"> resolution display we</font>

555
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,909
built the prototype via our display

556
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:20,199
where we use a lens set from an old via

557
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:22,749
our display and then stuck it on top and

558
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,119
it seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work pretty well right so</font>

559
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:26,309
we started seeing that those consumer

560
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,269
level displays were getting high

561
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:31,210
resolution enough that they could be

562
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:34,330
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for VR so and we</font>

563
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:36,399
published his work in 2011 at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VAR</font>

564
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,139
conference to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> academic conference</font>

565
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:42,908
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I usually published</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to and palmer</font>

566
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:44,498
luckey saw this posting he was really

567
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:46,210
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in came to our lab and sort</font>

568
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:47,440
of talked to my boss and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he ended up</font>

569
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,990
getting a position working as a

570
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,899
technician in our lab and we hired him

571
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,820
using army funding to work on when the

572
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:57,969
funding was devoted for working on

573
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:01,360
low-cost virtuality displays for psych

574
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,909
psychological therapy so PTSD treatments

575
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,279
and other things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so the army</font>

576
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:08,499
gets the credit for the funding so under

577
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,149
marks guidance he worked on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

578
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:12,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">other displays like this one which we</font>

579
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:16,059
used at a sundance film festival

580
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:18,190
experience in immersive journalism so if

581
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:19,779
you google<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonny de la pena or immersive</font>

582
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,049

583
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the other notable thing we did was</font>

584
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,269
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said before a cardboard head</font>

585
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">mounted display</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we called the fov to go</font>

586
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:32,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">fold out viewer to go or a field of view</font>

587
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:36,009
to go basically this came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a in a</font>

588
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,779
envelope it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> laser cut out of foam</font>

589
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:39,700
core you could fold around and slide

590
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:42,460
your iPhone your Android phone into it

591
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,159
and we wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> software they would use the</font>

592
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,179
orientation tracking and render<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

593
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,220
views we use the you

594
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:50,919
the game engine and poof yeah we had

595
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,230
virtuality display in an envelope we

596
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,629
made about 250 of these and distribute

597
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,700
them for free back at the 2012 virtual

598
00:23:55,629 --> 00:24:00,279
reality conference shortly after we

599
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,240
introduced the project<font color="#CCCCCC"> palmer luckey</font>

600
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:06,070
left to go found oculus rift I do

601
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,379
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conversation between one</font>

602
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,899
hour postdoc who explained something

603
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:12,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how the field of view works and he</font>

604
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,989
mentioned something called the oculus

605
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,399
which is sort of like the you know area

606
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,409
around your eye the field of view around

607
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:19,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">a particular I and Palmer said that's a</font>

608
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:21,639
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great word do you mind if I use</font>

609
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:23,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for a company name yeah sure no</font>

610
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:27,850
problem in there yeah later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

611
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:30,789
like oh they was for that company dejavu

612
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:32,469
ride google cardboard 2014 fifteen to

613
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:35,350
twenty dollars we think ours probably

614
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs about five dollars each so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

615
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give it to government employees</font>

616
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,460
without worrying about bribing them and

617
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:46,019
causing real problems and then we went

618
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,029
on to create additional of 3d printed

619
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:52,600
displays the things we can snap onto an

620
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:54,759
iphone or slide over a tablet lens

621
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,289
assembly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can be afterwards I can</font>

622
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:01,149
demo some of these we open source

623
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:05,980
version so you could build<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

624
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:07,840
roughly equivalent to oculus rift<font color="#CCCCCC"> ek1 so</font>

625
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,730
it's kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right we use 3d</font>

626
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,860
printing we use laser cutters things

627
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,869
like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the secret to</font>

628
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,189
the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of via that we're</font>

629
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:17,439
experiencing the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> Renaissance is</font>

630
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,999
revisiting old technologies with new

631
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,289
approaches right so head-mounted

632
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:22,179
displays have been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long</font>

633
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:24,009
time actually but they had price points

634
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:25,929
that were way too high and they or they

635
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:27,879
relied on bulky CRT displays things like

636
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:30,009
that when you have smartphones and

637
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:32,980
tablet computers right the cost of the

638
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:35,139
economy scale goes down and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

639
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,409
the software right we have much more

640
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:40,629
powerful graphics chips so we can do we

641
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:42,429
can a do counter distortion and software

642
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:45,490
rather than designing a heavy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bowl keep</font>

643
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:47,409
a perfect optical lens set and then you

644
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,879
know new manufacturing techniques like

645
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:50,200
laser cutters and 3d printing the push

646
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,519
out new products and new prototypes

647
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,970
quickly and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there was the</font>

648
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:57,740
guidance of Mark bolas who pioneer in

649
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:01,040
virtuality for four decades

650
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:03,590
and was a really great guiding force let

651
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,809
me just make sure i'm not i'm saving

652
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:09,290
time enough time to go over everything

653
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:10,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">by not but ok so what's next what's the</font>

654
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,190
next in the journey to a virtual reality

655
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,110
so a huge number of head around this

656
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,340
place must be awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

657
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,780
little bit of danger in the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

658
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,399
now because there are so many virtuality

659
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,050
display companies all competing to

660
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,320
succeed allow them are following that

661
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,790
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> model that Microsoft Xbox or</font>

662
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Sony Playstation or Apple where we</font>

663
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,080
have these walled gardens so if you want

664
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,540
you know they allows them to control

665
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,909
like all aspects of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecosystem so if</font>

666
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,889
you want if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make the display you can</font>

667
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,179
make the store and then you can make the

668
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,580
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> money because you've control which</font>

669
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:43,490
games are out there and which are

670
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,139
exclusive to your to your system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

671
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,090
danger is right for us consumers right

672
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to buy a playstation</font>

673
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,530
xbox and whatever Nintendo sends out so

674
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,809
I can play all the games i want same

675
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,160
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same thing in VR and it</font>

676
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:56,720
might have to pay more to write because

677
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,690
the markets divided up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font>

678
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,370
forces don't work quite the same the

679
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,200
other thing right entertainment is

680
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,178
course you don't have to be pretty smart

681
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,800
to know that yeah at least for the short

682
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:09,320
term entertainment is going to be the

683
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,970
big driver in VR you know and

684
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,970
specifically playing video games in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

685
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,410
living room and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's okay with me the</font>

686
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,240
big game companies can make really great

687
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,210
experiences they're really fun to play

688
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,880
with but it doesn't really make me super

689
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,380
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to play a</font>

690
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,150
lot of video<font color="#CCCCCC"> games I have two small kids</font>

691
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,890
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on my time but I'm and</font>

692
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,420
anyway I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interested in</font>

693
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:36,920
other applications and other research

694
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:38,510
areas for virtual reality but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah since</font>

695
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,190
gaming entertainment are going to be

696
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,929
drivers right<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully be our</font>

697
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,270
technology will become cheaper through

698
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:45,860
that economies of scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so my job is</font>

699
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,080
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a researcher is how do i</font>

700
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,580
leverage those game technologies to do

701
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,530
other things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think are more</font>

702
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,949
interesting and more important for for

703
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:57,740
Humanity so I really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at vr</font>

704
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,360
for how to better understand people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

705
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,040
interested in how people perceive and

706
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,830
understand the world I'm also interested

707
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,020
to see how virtuality can make us into

708
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:08,120
better people you really shouldn't use

709
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,759
we are to make a smarter more skilled a

710
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,889
more thoughtful and I'd also like to

711
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,779
vr to help me make beautiful things I

712
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">think most of us are really interested</font>

713
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:18,769
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> making and building and I think</font>

714
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:20,690
virtuality should make better artists

715
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:22,579
and better engineers and better builders

716
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,619
and you know humans love to build and

717
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:29,209
make and if you know if he ours not

718
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:31,728
helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> us do that you know so as a</font>

719
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:34,309
scientist right in my lab we're doing a

720
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:36,049
lot of studies<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing human subjects</font>

721
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,609
to try out different experiences and

722
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,408
trying to understand what the technology

723
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:42,259
can do and also you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it can</font>

724
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:44,059
tell us about the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves so</font>

725
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:45,799
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're studying things like</font>

726
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,029
context-dependent memory which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

727
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,908
know the environment you're in really

728
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:51,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">has an effect on what you can remember</font>

729
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:53,419
if you are tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

730
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,339
you studied<font color="#E5E5E5"> something usually have a</font>

731
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,759
benefit to learning right so can I use

732
00:28:55,339 --> 00:29:01,190
Virtual Reality to recreate that context

733
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:03,109
and I'm also doing some experiments

734
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,549
looking at motor applications so if I

735
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:06,918
put something in a virtual environment I

736
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:09,289
have them toss<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ball the target fifty</font>

737
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,879
sixty seventy five times and I'm

738
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,319
changing the the physics in the

739
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:14,779
environment changing how that ball flies

740
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,658
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that change how you know people</font>

741
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:19,429
are changing you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they throw</font>

742
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:21,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that ball you know what is that what</font>

743
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:25,009
effects does that have on the motor

744
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:27,349
system and their cognition and we're

745
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:28,819
also experiential characters and you

746
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:30,109
know I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the experiment where</font>

747
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:31,699
you walk around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the character and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

748
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:33,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">character is more realistic you give</font>

749
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:36,379
them more personal space so I'm I just

750
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,309
we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a study right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now where</font>

751
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:39,289
we're doing some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting things</font>

752
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,999
where we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we simulate the</font>

753
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,859
character actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching you so the</font>

754
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:45,440
character has some physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence and</font>

755
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:47,599
we're I don't have haven't analyzed the

756
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,569
data yet but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

757
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,189
a change in how people in the personal

758
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:54,859
space the proximate behavior they have

759
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,509
around a character<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are sort of</font>

760
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,039
prime to believe that the character can

761
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:02,869
can physically touch them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

762
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:05,149
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solid body let's see yeah virtual</font>

763
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:07,728
<font color="#CCCCCC">reality I think has great potential for</font>

764
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:09,018
education we can use virtuality to a lot

765
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:11,269
of students to visit world to there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

766
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:14,299
extremely small like the molecule I have

767
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:16,669
a demo on the one of the tablets the

768
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:19,339
distant like the Moon or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mars and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

769
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:21,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">long ago like ancient Greece the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Institute for critic technologies our</font>

771
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:24,440

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Parthenon</font>

773
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,350
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a reconstruction</font>

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,270
with the appropriate lighting

environmental lighting of what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

776
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,530
on really looked like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and being able to</font>

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,920
walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in VR would be quite</font>

778
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:38,870
amazing yeah we can explore mathematical

779
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,730
worlds in VR<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can use virtuality</font>

explore<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you know and learn how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

781
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,630
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and observe people doing</font>

782
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">something from every angle so you really</font>

783
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:49,090
understand what they're what they're

784
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,800
building we're also looking at

785
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,110
perceptual illusions that can enhance

786
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,310
local motion in VR so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make people</font>

787
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they were walking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through an</font>

00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:00,200
infinite<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes infinitely large space</font>

789
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,379
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> making them walk in circles without</font>

790
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:07,370
them really noticing we have a great

791
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:09,710
tracking space that's maybe not quite

792
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">double but bigger than this particular</font>

793
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:15,200
room and we do experiments on that on

794
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:16,820
that stage to understand you know what

795
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,590
are the perceptual tricks that we can do

796
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,570
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that they're</font>

797
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,280
walking in a straight line down a long

circles are walking with slight curves

800
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,770
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know important for</font>

801
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,420
military training because we they want

802
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,670
to have these<font color="#E5E5E5"> big experiences but also</font>

803
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,110
for you know for a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or for</font>

807
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:44,150
you can understand you know the how the

812
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,790
people how to shoot things but we're

813
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,370
teaching them how to process what's

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:21,260
kind of that play by play you know video

825
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,629
a good job that they learn what they

what they were supposed to perform and

00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:20,869
create and visualize beautiful things we

using tablets tablets<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddr4 looking at</font>

852
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:29,529
big data and that was a interesting

project we did a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and</font>

854
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:33,859
yeah i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know formats like this</font>

855
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,839
where you're not fully enclosed into

the tablet<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

861
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:46,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">different than stopping this thing on</font>

862
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:47,839
that takes some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 30 seconds or</font>

863
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:50,149
something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

864
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,279
explain that to somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else it's like</font>

865
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:55,428
that that VR game where you're helping

866
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,940
people defuse bombs yeah it's just

867
00:33:55,429 --> 00:34:00,289
easier if you can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> here look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

868
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,330
we're also looking working with other

869
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,940
researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> as ICT on a project called</font>

870
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,460
rapid avatar capture and the idea is

871
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can use an array of cameras to</font>

872
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,539
capture<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 3d model of a person in</font>

873
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,379
minutes and then that 3d model can be

874
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:17,299
rigged and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that virtual</font>

875
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:20,569
environment and animated either live or

876
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:24,409
with can data and either be a virtual

877
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:26,389
character or your own avatar with the

878
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:29,899
cinema school we're exploring a new use

879
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:31,609
of virtuality for storytelling we create

880
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:32,960
a system actually captures and renders

881
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:34,429
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> objects using an image based</font>

882
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,619
approach so we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a series of</font>

883
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,329
photographs around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

884
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:40,549
perimeter of the object<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're not</font>

885
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:42,289
creating a 3d model we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

886
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:43,940
using those images and then sometimes

887
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,700
we're rebuilding the images so that we

888
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,470
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a proper light field representation</font>

889
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

890
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:54,638
ject but essentially we're using VR to

891
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:56,500
do claymation animation in a VR

892
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,960
experience and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> award</font>

893
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,849
at the siggraph a while back for this

894
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:07,510
work siggraph is a big computer graphics

895
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:10,480
conference and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might be able to show a</font>

896
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:12,580
video of that but let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me finish up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

897
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,310
then we can jump to that video the final

898
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,529
lesson is that this new boom in

899
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,990
virtuality is rooted in you know

900
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:21,250
somewhat in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my research lab at USC and</font>

901
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the other researchers have been</font>

902
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,200
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual reality from the</font>

903
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,390
1960s and beyond so the story is of

904
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,810
course more nuanced and what the press

905
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,950
and what certain companies tell you

906
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,630
research labs really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trained the</font>

907
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,220
engineers and scientists that create new

908
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,930
technologies they form communities that

909
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,490
create and share new ideas and they

910
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,200
demonstrate the possibilities they show

911
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,879
what can be done and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspire</font>

912
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,118
companies to create new products and

913
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,010
it's vital that I think my opinion and

914
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can share it if you like the</font>

915
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,849
companies and governments and societies

916
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,580
really support research in these labs

917
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:56,080
and of course in places like this and I

918
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:01,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's really how the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

919
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:03,940
created I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for your</font>

920
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:08,560
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is my contact information</font>

921
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:11,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and after this I have one more plug</font>

922
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,849
that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you</font>

923
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,630
so quick plug I'm actually so I

924
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned a couple times this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli</font>

925
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,620
the virtuality conference it's the

926
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,029
premier academic conference on virtual

927
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,790
reality it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be held in</font>

928
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,470
Manhattan Beach March<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 to 20 second</font>

929
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,350
I'm actually one of the general chairs

930
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,660
for the conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know feel</font>

931
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:38,330
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check out the website and see if</font>

932
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,040
you want to attend I think deadlines for

933
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,420
academic papers have passed but there

934
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,450
are demos and posters that can still be

935
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,920
submitted and companies were you know

936
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,629
we're really interested in companies

937
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,640
helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sponsor and maybe also</font>

938
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,260
exhibit and there is a cost for

939
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,140
registration but if you're a student<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

940
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,580
you are accepted as a student volunteer

941
00:36:53,140 --> 00:37:00,230
you can get free registration if you

942
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:05,740
help out I think I have a few moments so

943
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:10,120
I'm I want to show that video of the

944
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:21,020
near-field a week yeah our<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop-motion</font>

945
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:23,480
work in VR and to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type of</font>

scrub and determine best poses we then

955
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,060
employ image based rendering techniques

956
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,620
in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> case we billboard left and right</font>

957
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,390

958
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:54,290
correspond to the correct horizontal

960
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,800
are so realistically captivating as they

961
