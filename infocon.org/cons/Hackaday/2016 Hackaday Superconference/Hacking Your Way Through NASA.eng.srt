00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,240
alright so next up for NASA hacks we

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,850
have Lucy do and Charles dandy<font color="#E5E5E5"> no Lucy</font>

00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,290
is a mechatronics engineer at JPL she

6
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,650
received her bachelor's and master's

7
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,480
from MIT in mechanical engineering where

8
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,660
she helped found the student-run

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">makerspace and she has competed on the</font>

most both seasons of the new battle bots

us all hopefully not because of him<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

18
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:29,049
so can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> please give a round of</font>

19
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:31,209
applause to Lucy and Charles right hello

20
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,399
um and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to talk to you about</font>

21
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:37,090
NASA hacks these are ways that nASA has

22
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,709
used software or<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware in slightly</font>

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,899
unconventional ways that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might not</font>

24
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:44,200
have thought of in the first place to

25
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:46,029
either solve an emergency problem or to

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a little bit more efficient with</font>

27
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:54,219
resources so everybody's heard of Apollo

28
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:56,549
13<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably for Apollo 13 the oxygen</font>

30
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,939
on Apollo 13s way to the moon and so the

31
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:09,038
lunar landing was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh the lunar landing</font>

32
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:10,780
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> cancelled and the whole all of NASA</font>

33
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,510
was focused on trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the crew</font>

34
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,590
back safely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to earth so one of the</font>

35
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,390
things they had to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

36
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,390
move the entire crew over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the lunar</font>

37
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,849
module to save energy problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

38
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:26,040
lunar module wasn't really designed to

39
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:26,040
design for prolonged<font color="#CCCCCC"> spaceflight and</font>

40
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,049
there are a lot of problems leading up

41
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,629
from that NASA does NASA's people on

42
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:36,250
earth decided to do some calculations

43
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,560
and they figured that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lunar module</font>

44
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:43,540
did actually have enough power to propel

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,310
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to earth barely but one</font>

46
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the big problems was the lunar module</font>

47
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,470
only had co2 filters that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed</font>

48
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:52,299
for two men over two days rather than

49
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,930
for three men over the course<font color="#CCCCCC"> of four</font>

50
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:58,329
days so they had a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of extra co2</font>

51
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,690
filters for the service module but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

52
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:05,349
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunar module hilariously the</font>

53
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:08,530
filters for the initial command module

54
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,569
were square and the barrels for the ones

55
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,489
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lunar module were round so they</font>

56
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:15,790
had a literal problem of trying to put a

57
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,620
square peg in a round hole and they fix

58
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,780
this with a lot of duct tape and extra

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:26,170
space suit and some plastic bags who

60
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,359
knew so another problem that NASA

61
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,849
eventually ran into was the Ares one

62
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,440
rocket after the whole rocket was built

63
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were going through testing they</font>

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,579
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that during the final stage of</font>

65
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:42,940
launch the the vibrations in the final

66
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:44,919
stage actually caused so much movement

67
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the astronauts that they weren't</font>

68
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,030
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the digital display</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,060
they can't read read the digital display

70
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can't do their jobs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

71
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,510
problem so at first NASA panicked they

72
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,829
were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my god this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

73
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,018
million-dollar problem how are we going

74
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,639
to fix this but the engineers did their

75
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,040
jobs and found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

76
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,500
accelerometers basic accelerometers on

77
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,418
the seats of the astronauts and measure

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,370
the frequency of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vibration they could</font>

79
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:13,239
blink<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> digital screens at the same</font>

80
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:16,000
frequency and the screens would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

81
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,440
perfect you can see crystal clear so it

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,029
was a million-dollar possibly

83
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,680
million-dollar problem that was fixed by

84
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,679
just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple accelerometers</font>

85
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so this one's not really a hack the</font>

86
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,530
ISS solar arrays were designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

87
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,260
but it's kind of an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using</font>

88
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a little using things for</font>

89
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,210
multiple purposes so for the solar

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,070
arrays you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> move them</font>

91
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,390
articulate them in different directions

92
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,099
part of this is so that the solar arrays

93
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,250
can be more efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and face the Sun</font>

94
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,780
but another part is if you just because

95
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,030
you're in space<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean there's not</font>

96
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,599
any atmosphere at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

97
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them as sales and that ISS</font>

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,260
can adjust the altitude slightly based

99
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,160
on the angle of these solar arrays and

100
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,690
so that way you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

101
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,730
propellant to make slight adjustments

102
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,980
and propellant is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

103
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:12,510
expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so a lot of times</font>

104
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,990
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to space you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very</font>

105
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">small amount of space to do and</font>

106
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,070
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want something big to</font>

107
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,510
come out usually so large antennas

108
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:28,349
stored in very small volumes so this

109
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,320
example is for a CubeSat which is shown

110
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,200
in that corner it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a small blue square</font>

111
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,180
and we needed antennas that four

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,260
antennas that are about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> long to</font>

113
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,970
scale and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about something</font>

114
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really long pretty</font>

115
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,890
rigid pretty strong but can store in a

116
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,670
small space a tape measure is a really

117
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,110
perfect example of this so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can if</font>

118
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,870
you see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the picture over on the</font>

119
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,420
bottom that's the yellow circles our

120
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,130
tape measures coiled up and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

121
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,080
that they're coiled up until they're

122
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,930
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy and you just kind of let</font>

123
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,150
them all spring out and they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

124
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,860
the picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top so here's a</font>

125
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,109
picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> from one of the tests that they</font>

126
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,180
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Springs out pretty well</font>

127
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:15,090
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a little chaotic after this in</font>

128
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,160
the full video but eventually they kind

129
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,549
of all stop bouncing and even out and

130
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:25,940
they deploy perfectly so tape measures

131
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:29,970
in space good idea and now for turtles

132
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:37,200
hey so I'm going to move around a little

133
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:39,930
bit skin<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have anybody in</font>

134
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,219
the audience who is who is a Fisher an

135
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,650
angler<font color="#CCCCCC"> will fisher folk one good nobody</font>

136
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,010
else like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a half half raised</font>

137
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,940
tonight thank you all right so is there

138
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,430
any lease know what at Fish Hooks looks

139
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,110
like like that's got the barb<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

140
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,580
so if you're if you're used to fishing

141
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,550
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the fish hooks are great</font>

142
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,859
for catching two things one is fish and

143
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:06,300
the other is everything else that you

144
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:10,170
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want great for logs seaweed nom</font>

145
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,870
and so taking that that kind of problem

146
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,800
and turning it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a solution when you</font>

147
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,290
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab something that you don't</font>

148
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,750
really know what it is you use the thing

149
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:24,960
that grabs everything whether you want

150
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:27,510
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not but one hook might not do</font>

151
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,190
the trick there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good chance</font>

152
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,620
that it will but there's good chance

153
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:35,640
that it won't so you can just increase

154
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:39,150
your chance of success by<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting a lot</font>

155
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:42,990
of hooks so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one cassette</font>

156
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,239
of hooks<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see over here that's a</font>

157
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,510
lot of cassettes each each individual

158
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,700
hook is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its compliant and can articulate</font>

159
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,560
on its own so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when one of these catches</font>

160
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,400
a little bump or<font color="#CCCCCC"> an asperity if you will</font>

161
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,310
it will hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to</font>

162
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,929
two flexaway as this gets pulled in so i

163
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,400
guess i should back up for a second the

164
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,110
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this mechanism works is that</font>

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">the all of those start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cassettes</font>

166
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,740
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> raised and then they go down pull</font>

167
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,010
in and move up and that provides a way

168
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,800
for this thing here to stay against the

169
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,960
asteroid I thinking like why do we need

170
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> snag an asteroid with with fishing</font>

171
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,340
hooks for any reason whatsoever and part

172
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,750
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to redirect</font>

173
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,760
them if the asteroid we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

174
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,340
be directed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> fish hooks that just kind</font>

175
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,610
of snagged in there now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

176
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,610
drill

177
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,480
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drill an anchor into end</font>

178
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,250
of the asteroid but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again think about</font>

179
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,020
drilling if you're drilling something

180
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,330
going to push into it now imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

181
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,400
drilling on a skateboard that's not an

182
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,100
ice rink that has air bearings because

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,380
its face so that frictionless thing that

184
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,150
you all really loved I loved anyway in

185
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,590
high school that's real that's in space

186
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,360
so you try to push with that drill and

187
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,670
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep pushing away in a</font>

188
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,190
way in a way now you're oh you're

189
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,810
floating that's that's the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

190
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,420
mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these hooks kind of hold that</font>

191
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,630
in and keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it moving I keep the drill</font>

192
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,339
engaged and just as a side note to that

193
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,590
mission because it is my 1 i'm working

194
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,590
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like it once you're anchored in</font>

195
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,630
then you just pick up the ash<font color="#CCCCCC"> tour pick</font>

196
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:24,300
up a boulder up the asteroid wrap some

197
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:29,080
robotic legs around it and bring home

198
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,849
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> why so testing this out how how</font>

199
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,130
do you test out whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this</font>

200
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,840
device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to use will</font>

201
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,070
actually work on something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

202
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,720
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in this case an asteroid</font>

203
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,280
we've never sent anything to an asteroid

204
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
and we have we got some pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

205
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,689
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> Olander didn't quite anchor so we</font>

206
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,820
know what doesn't work but that doesn't

207
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">give us a whole lot of information what</font>

208
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,730
will so based on some some measurements

209
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:57,010
and scientists<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a bunch of things</font>

210
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,350
that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully understand we have</font>

211
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,810
some compression strength estimates and

212
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,750
these estimates will kind of help direct

213
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:08,229
approximately what this material should

214
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,670
look like so cohesion and compressor

215
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,910
strength are two important things to

216
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,770
give you an a sense of like how we how

217
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,500
well we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know these things lunar regolith</font>

218
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,449
goes from point 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 1 snow point six to</font>

219
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,730
six so the the variances and these are

220
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,420
huge too so target were trying to hit is

221
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:29,500
a bit nebulous but how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

222
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,990
surface<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an asteroid with concrete</font>

223
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,370
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a Dirac so we make our own</font>

224
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,350
rocks we make our own rocks always with

225
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,920
concrete but the rocks are a little

226
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong the the one of the mechanisms</font>

227
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,540
that makes rocks on earth so hard and

228
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,120
rock-like is

229
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,099
is the gravity and the compression and

230
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,650
things and mechanisms that allow

231
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,020
everything to compress it all together

232
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,949
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those simply don't exist in space so</font>

233
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,670
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect it's going to be much more</font>

234
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,800
flaky much softer and but still very

235
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,030
brittle so the foam concrete does a

236
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,920
great great<font color="#CCCCCC"> job it also provides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice</font>

237
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:12,439
texture for those fish hooks to grab

238
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:14,959
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so another another issue</font>

239
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,000
that we face is trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font>

240
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,370
well the wheels on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Mars rovers are</font>

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,230
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to focus on the Emmy</font>

242
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,980
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> missions the spirit an opportunity</font>

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rovers and they're moving along and</font>

244
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,420
things were going pretty well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in</font>

245
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,680
some sand and we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like is how</font>

246
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,810
well are the wheels moving we say we're

247
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,189
rotating one full rotation we know what

248
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,199
the diameter<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we're traveling about</font>

249
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,160
that far but how how good are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

250
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,160
actually doing and how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we measure</font>

251
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,709
this more accurately one way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

252
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to look at your tire tracks and the</font>

253
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,450
Emmy our wheels are have ridges for

254
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,980
traction they're all evenly spaced and

255
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,360
there's one spot on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wheel that's</font>

256
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,160
completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the rest of</font>

257
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the spots because that's how the rover</font>

258
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,329
was anchored down to the spacecraft so

259
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,010
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch why everything was shaking</font>

260
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,960
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was on</font>

261
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,810
an Ares rocket but if it was shaking

262
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">like crazy that that vehicle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

263
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,979
flop around inside the spacecraft so

264
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,220
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> preloaded with the pretty</font>

265
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:14,210
large bolts that then pop off so that

266
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:17,960
structure is more beefy and as it rolls

267
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:21,770
along the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sand it creates a stamp as it</font>

268
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,900
goes along so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go back and measure</font>

269
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,750
the distance<font color="#CCCCCC"> between those stamps and</font>

270
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,260
try to calculate you know for this input

271
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we gave saying move forward 100</font>

272
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,800
feet did it actually move forward 100

273
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,040
feet where did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it slip and mapping that</font>

274
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,780
terrain to what is and is not

275
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,890
transmissible is very important to avoid

276
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:44,360
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuck she only goes so far it's</font>

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to not get stuck in train</font>

278
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">there definitely with a very extreme</font>

279
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,020
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is right here we're kind</font>

280
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,510
of dragging one wheel you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

281
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,640
difference in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tracks but over here</font>

282
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,180
you can see right here this roughness is

283
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,520
launched<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock this roughness is the lawn</font>

284
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,319
so you can kind of map out how far the

285
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,149
wheel is actually turning and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

286
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,800
based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way the sand is bunched up</font>

287
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,140
it's pretty likely that this wheel was

288
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,859
actually kind of doing one of these

289
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:15,850
rather than a nice smooth motion so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

290
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,790
was kicking up a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

291
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,680
keeping in line with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the</font>

292
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:24,730
Curiosity rover was being<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed they</font>

293
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,219
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same odometry feature sort of</font>

294
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,890
hack if you will and incorporated it

295
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,959
rather this curiosity as we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but</font>

296
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,540
maybe everybody know that curiosity came

297
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,399
down from the sky crane yeah seen that

298
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,329
video if you haven't check it out it's

299
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,089
cool there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a launch lock</font>

300
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,160
reason for the wheels to have a

301
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,320
discontinued<font color="#CCCCCC"> juwel spot but because we</font>

302
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,579
were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our benefit for</font>

303
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,480
the emmy our missions it was

304
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:55,899
incorporated for the MSL mission if only

305
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">for an excuse to to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write JPL in Morse</font>

306
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:01,149
code because cheap Hills has

307
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,830
subcontractor of NASA and they don't

308
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:09,459
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like us putting our name on</font>

309
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:12,610
anything so now we're all around<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tag</font>

310
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:21,040
Mars all day every day this is JPL

311
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:23,279
across them you're welcome so this this

312
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,750
gets in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

313
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,189
kind of been looking at here and

314
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,790
exploring is a little bit more

315
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:33,640
traditional hacks this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example is a</font>

316
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,880
Hot Wheels car it's a box car that's

317
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,250
been modified you can actually see the

318
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,550
wheels in their news and 3d printed

319
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:48,760
parts that make the modifications this

320
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:51,910
system here is the that's actually a

321
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,950
robotic light or<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a leg it's the</font>

322
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,600
wrecked system so even though that just

323
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,089
spins like a wheel because it has a

324
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,560
flexure here it causes this robot that

325
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of bounce a little bit and it's</font>

326
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,359
actually considered a a leggy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Drobot</font>

327
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,219
this isn't the most impressive

328
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,880
implementation of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but Boston</font>

329
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,480
Dynamics have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> good ones I think</font>

330
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,189
and we've pen who has has a lot of

331
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,440
interesting robots that make it in that

332
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:19,750
system if any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch season one of</font>

333
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:23,750
battle bots and saw one of the featured

334
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:26,750
rumbles<font color="#E5E5E5"> the robot overhaul which is one</font>

335
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:33,860
that I worked on was a walker shuffler

336
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:36,740
robot so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only Spacey's so yeah but</font>

337
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,020
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this small compact package we can</font>

338
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,910
make all of these Springs and gears and

339
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,260
and the chassis in the housing but it's

340
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,400
a Hot Wheels car that somebody already

341
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,480
did that and they made it they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

342
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,010
really well they put a lot of effort

343
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,980
into it and they made it mass producing

344
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,650
so why not build off that why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> hack</font>

345
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,810
this hardware to to advance your idea

346
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,860
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that fits into the NASA</font>

347
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,869
structure going to give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

348
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">peek inside is that there are thousands</font>

349
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people at NASA that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all have</font>

350
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:05,030
brilliant brilliant ideas this fantastic

351
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:07,520
amazing ideas and the NASA budget is

352
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,589
limited so we can't chase down every

353
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,319
idea so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that your idea</font>

354
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,150
has has some legs it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go</font>

355
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,370
somewhere and the best way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

356
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:19,790
by modifying something that's off the

357
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,160
shelf and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just focusing on the</font>

358
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:27,199
uniquely making that one aspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

359
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,180
a step above what the last thing was so

360
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,790
for example if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you want to</font>

361
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,589
show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sensor package can get</font>

362
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:38,420
around desert terrain and provide useful

363
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:40,010
feedback yeah you can spend a bunch of

364
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,250
time making your own custom robotic

365
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:46,010
rover or you can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your kid's</font>

366
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,010
sandbox<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to know that this</font>

367
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:52,310
engineer he did actually borrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'll</font>

368
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,930
say borrow this from his kids and this

369
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a off-the-shelf remote control</font>

371
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,620
going they have these grass<font color="#CCCCCC"> tigard</font>

372
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,290
things grip and you can't slow this

373
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,599
thing down it'll go over it'll go over

374
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">all kinds of rocks so it's perfect for</font>

375
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,310
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sensor package around rough</font>

376
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,230
desert terrain where it needed to

377
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,280
perform its censoring that's where my

378
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,650
knowledge drops off I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually</font>

379
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what that bad thing does but I</font>

380
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:22,279
really appreciated that it was well

381
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:27,259
fastened to its carrier via

382
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:30,450
and a very time and cost efficient way

383
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:33,509
similarly you need a small gamble for

384
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,100
your camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of this is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3d</font>

385
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:36,690
printed parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this gear system you</font>

386
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,779
can custom spec out your gears in order

387
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:44,190
them but a gear train and geared down

388
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:47,070
systems within toys are so common and so

389
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:53,879
well made that there's no reason to not

390
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:56,129
use that functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right and</font>

391
00:17:53,879 --> 00:18:02,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is is going to wrap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up with the</font>

392
00:17:56,129 --> 00:18:04,678
Galileo mission so Galileo had hopes and

393
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,340
dreams of being a beautiful blooming

394
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,539
flower like this but things didn't go

395
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,139
quite right and it became a much more

396
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:16,470
grainy not fully deployed image like

397
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:19,019
this so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-gain antenna right here</font>

398
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,179
which provided a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gain in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

399
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:24,899
design does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide nearly as much</font>

400
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:27,029
gain when it's not quite open so kind of

401
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:28,949
like back in the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you had to</font>

402
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,119
pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that and turn off your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cell</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">day we're going it's be a fairly large</font>

405
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:39,178
antenna your antenna matters it matters

406
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:41,008
a lot so with a only partially deployed

407
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,440
antenna we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk back and</font>

408
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:44,549
forth to earth with not only the delay

409
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,169
that comes inherent with spacecraft

410
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:48,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the speed of light traveling</font>

411
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,710
between planets or traveling<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending</font>

communication between planets even at

413
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:56,369
the speed of light is still pretty slow

414
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,899
to couple that with you know I'm going

415
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say something it's going to take you</font>

416

10 minutes to hear it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the time</font>

417
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,849
you hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it sounds like I'm talking</font>

418
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a cell phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in basement and you come</font>

419
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:09,149
back like what and I send some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

420
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:12,090
and what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this forever but the</font>

421
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:14,219
the change in the mission structure also

422
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,389
led to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a change in the resource</font>

423
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,859
balancing and packaging suddenly the

00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,998
<font color="#E5E5E5">bandwidth because it was now much much</font>

supposed to be was the critical aspect

427
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,979
of this and the onboard processing power

428
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:33,059
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kelly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a while ago</font>

it was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to begin with was</font>

430
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,389
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of it because you're not</font>

431
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,439
sending a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information back and</font>

432
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:40,860
forth and that computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit</font>

433
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,379
idly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of time so rather than</font>

434
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:47,189
sending a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data then use that</font>

435
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:49,559
processing on board processor<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to do</font>

436
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,070
data compression in a way that hadn't

437
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:55,289
been done before and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm more mechanical</font>

438
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,299
so that's where my knowledge of what

439
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly the fix was kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of drops off</font>

440
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:02,820
but they used<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use data compression</font>

441
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,710
to maximize the resource utilization and

442
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,840
still have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very successful</font>

443
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:13,740
mission with a huge amount of science

444
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:16,889
data and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we provide you with</font>

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:20,639
references not i'll totally makeup made

446
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:22,879
up and that wraps it up a little bit

447
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font>
