00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,710
and down to around 5 volt and I quickly

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,700
also I made several microcontroller

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,680
there is an antenna engineering and

they're releasing three I<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">explain later and here is a outline my</font>

73

talk today firstly i will explain why do

material<font color="#CCCCCC"> magnetic material</font>

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,590
and how it is useful and what is a

79
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,489
drawback of the conventional magnetic

80
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:01,210
material and the third way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I explained</font>

81
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,990
how to create the artificial

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're known and the general component</font>

85
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,370
including the transistor if we key and

86
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:19,090
the metal structures and they're just

87
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:21,620
dielectrics now let's start from the

88
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,380
dielectric material why do we need a

89
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,919
dielectric<font color="#E5E5E5"> material good dielectric</font>

90
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:31,340
material that has no electric

<font color="#E5E5E5">conductivity and instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of non</font>

92
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:38,210
conductivity it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> some electric</font>

93
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,580
polarization inside materials if we

94
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,430
apply some electric field to the

95
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,070
material the reserve local electric

96
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,849
polarization this polarization will

97
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:52,430
enhance their electric flux density and

98
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,560
this coefficient between the electric

99
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,620
field can be associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,560
permittivity by knowing the permittivity

101
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,780
we can estimate the web links inside

103
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,388

design the waveguide design and<font color="#CCCCCC"> RF</font>

in this case we can leaguer this

443
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:40,209
applied magnetic field and that reads to

444
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,879
the fact that if we change the applied

445
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:46,480

<font color="#CCCCCC">figure the spear showing that the power</font>

by the antenna structure itself without

very nice but it has some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Drobot because</font>

each of the ring resonator requires an

leads to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight apt or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> H transistors</font>

539
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:26,169
some non-linearity and decrease of other

541
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:33,429
actually this is a the original case at

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:43,059
further decrease of the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of of the</font>

545
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:48,220

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,790
in the fear of aging like this it's

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,250
connected and here i put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beer</font>

connecting to top layer to the layers

00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:04,600
like this and in this case the first

551
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,879
good point is that directive active

Earth's field but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some drawback</font>

591
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:17,030
but point is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely need</font>

592
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:20,150
some power to to drive apt without bias

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,120
small powers don't know the power

596
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,970
consumption but this type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> power</font>

597
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:35,199
consumption can be reduced by using very

598
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:38,110
sophisticated microwave technology under

this is a last slide but here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

600
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:45,850
say that and this electromagnetic

601
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:50,110
response is created by the well-known

602
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:52,959
device we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> however if we</font>
