00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,280
Mike's dish um I worked a little bit

26
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,810
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> voy on getting the badges ready for</font>

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,209
badge hacking and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excited</font>

28
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,550
on to have a piece of hardware for you

29
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:54,039
to have your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and voya seem to</font>

30
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,050
find just the perfect set of parameters

31
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:58,179
for this piece of hardware so that

32
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,640
everyone no matter your experience level

33
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:02,679
or your interests can really take it and

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,129
run with it the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

35
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:08,949
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the design just still</font>

36
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:11,739
look and the feel and the shape and the

37
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:15,450
function of it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant it's really</font>

38
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:19,450
a piece of art and you know I guess I

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,040
face value it's a bearer PCB but you

40
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,440
would ruin it by putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a case</font>

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,510
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful for what it is right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,590
and even I didn't think it could get

43
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,840
better from the time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had the</font>

44
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,120
prototype till now but some things

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,410
changed a little bit so we had a glossy

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,910
black finish before and this matte black

47
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,890
finish is much better

48
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,420
I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it how the silk screen</font>

49
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,880
that says how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can a super conference on</font>

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,339
the front matches I'm kind of with the

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,400
color of the LEDs when they're all off

52
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,130
and the reset button and the power

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,690
button used to be read in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

54
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">prototype and they got changed to this</font>

55
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,290
color I think it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> ties it together</font>

56
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,649
um if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the badge from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

57
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,290
side the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has these um</font>

58
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,540
through-hole battery holders that are

59
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,560
mounted on the edge it really cuts down

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,179
on the apparent thickness of the badge

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,130
because you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of splitting the</font>

62
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,710
difference there and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

63
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,049
nice um you know aesthetic to it that

64
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,880
you don't notice is right right off is

65
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,190
that the board is cut out just a little

66
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,920
bit so that the the amount that the

67
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,350
batteries stick off his wings is also

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,079
you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pushed in it's just an</font>

69
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing piece of design you add into it</font>

70
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the 45-degree cutouts and how they're</font>

71
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,140
laid out and the ratios there and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

72
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,050
I can't think that this could be any

73
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,029
better than it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh boy although he has</font>

74
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,590
lost his voice is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front row and I</font>

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,880
just like to recognize all the work they

76
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,880
did on this to give him a hand right now

77
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,439
alright so I do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some slides and</font>

78
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,250
these slides are all about hacking the

79
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:04,980
badge and everything you need to make

80
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:07,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'm hacking the</font>

81
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,988
super con badge if you have never before

82
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,059
touched a piece of hardware you can make

83
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,299
this badge do something so i would say

84
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,130
um figure out how to turn a light on or

85
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,139
turn the light off it's an amazing thing

86
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,759
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a cliché right with a</font>

87
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">cadet ready like I made it blink i made</font>

88
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,370
a blink you but there's big power in

89
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,169
that so if you've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done anything</font>

90
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,870
with hard book before set that as your

91
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:30,090
goal we have a/c framework on that it's

92
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,300
all set to go basically you can go and

93
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,820
turn a 0 to a 1 in a specific place or

94
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,759
120 and that either lights up or turns

95
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,680
off in LED ask anyone here they'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

96
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,720
happy to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk you through this now</font>

97
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,580
if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a seasoned veteran and you</font>

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,750
know how to you know right machine code

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you want to get really close to it</font>

100
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,919
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that as well so let's dive</font>

101
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
right in these are the addresses that

102
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,609
you might want to take note of so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

103
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,349
go ahead and pause there for a second so

104
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,570
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is a page that boy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I put</font>

105
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:59,130
up that has on pretty much all of the

106
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,389
information that's in this talk is there

107
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,219
so you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reference it</font>

108
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:06,240
again it's got the schematic it has the

109
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,830
files it has the compiled demo that came

110
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,110
with your badge it has links to the

111
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,880
crypto challenge so you can flash you

112
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,530
know what you've got the badge which can

113
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,270
get back to stock you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put your own</font>

114
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,900
code on you can do the code challenge

115
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,508
the other one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the C framework this is</font>

116
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,799
just a quick ide project that you can

117
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:27,690
unzip<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does shows you how to do</font>

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,919
button input and how to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on</font>

119
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:35,969
the display<font color="#CCCCCC"> and read from the</font>

120
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:39,780
accelerometers here is the schematic is

121
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:46,590
there a laser pointer no laser pointer

122
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:48,619
all right but I'll cursor

123
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,150
oh look at that there's a cursor

124
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,820
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so uh this is the</font>

125
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,179
chip right here it's a pic 18 LF 25k<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

126
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,190
that has USB on functionality on it

127
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,380
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you Chris Gamal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so this</font>

128
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,790
is USB functionality on it and so in

129
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,800
order to programming bed you do not need

130
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,450
a proper program or you can use one if

131
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,910
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to but there's a bootloader on</font>

132
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,909
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Garrett Scott and his colleagues</font>

133
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,310
over at microchip<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a bunch of stuff</font>

134
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">to help us get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this new bootloader which</font>

135
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,590
enumerates as a USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> thumb drive so when</font>

136
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,260
you plug in USB to your badge you can

137
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold down the power button and press</font>

138
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,250
reset and that'll put it in bootloader

139
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,669
mode you'll you'll have an LED that will

140
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,350
start blinking on the badge will appear

141
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,260
as a thumb drive on your computer and

142
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just copy a compiled hex file</font>

143
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto it and then press the power button</font>

144
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run your user code so once you're</font>

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,780
hacking on the badge you don't need to

146
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">unplug the USB until you're all done</font>

147
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,559
with your hacking you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just power</font>

148
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,880
reset to get into bootloader mode and

149
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,960
then power to start running the user

150
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,400
code I do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hardware</font>

151
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,680
though for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are doing</font>

152
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,330
the hardware hacking challenges so if

153
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,710
you the nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the bootloader</font>

154
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,719
handles all this stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go over</font>

155
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,359
kind of quickly but what boy has set up

156
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,090
is an LED<font color="#E5E5E5"> road driver right here so it's</font>

157
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,250
got 16 on lines that's getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> shifted</font>

158
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,739
in through this data line in this clock

159
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,650
line and on the high side he's got

160
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,570
MOSFETs to turn it on so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only on</font>

161
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:20,070
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning on a few LEDs at once</font>

162
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:22,170
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a demultiplexer decoder</font>

163
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,450
it's a decoder chip right here so he's

164
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,940
getting these three lines to help decode

165
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,740
that stuff one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons you might</font>

166
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,360
want to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the bootloader is that</font>

167
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,860
it handles some stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

168
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">tricky so for instance if you look at</font>

169
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,340
these lines for the buttons they are

170
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,840
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shared up onto the decoder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font>

171
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,219
so there's some trickiness going on in

172
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,169
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it has written about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

173
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,690
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you get elbow deep</font>

174
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:48,300
or shoulder deeper worse check that out

175
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,880
a new thing with the badge here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

176
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,470
breakout header so it's on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and</font>

177
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,600
it's not populated but we do have

178
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,070
headers in the badge hacking area so you

179
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,210
can solder on pin headers and

180
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,540
there are connectors they're available

181
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,580
as well there are five general purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

182
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,240
opens right here and then to ground and

183
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:09,090
to voltage also on this chip is an

184
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,840
accelerometer which is just connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

185
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:15,000
with two pins this up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top right</font>

186
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,520
here is the infrared communication we're

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go over that in a bit and this</font>

188
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,630
is the programming header right here in

189
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,030
the USB I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pretty much takes</font>

190
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:27,450
care of it excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so let's</font>

191
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,070
jump in on in the sea framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

192
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,510
a memory map so all the stuff that I'm

193
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,760
about to go over has like register

194
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,189
numbers you can look up all those

195
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">numbers in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this file which I should have</font>

196
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,930
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file name in their butts called</font>

197
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,270
hae badge dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> H there's only a couple</font>

198
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,169
header files in there and some of the

199
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,780
stuff we're going to be talking about

200
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,870
for instance like the buffer to write to

201
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:52,170
the screen so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 16</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rows of 8</font>

202
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:59,000
bits which represents the 16 rows on

203
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:59,000
your badge right there um let me go over

204
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:04,530
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that the badge has in</font>

205
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,270
the stock firmware so um how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

206
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,310
today did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hear someone pick up the</font>

207
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,439
badge for the first time ago oh it has

208
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tetris neat I most favorite that about</font>

209
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,140
30 times did I think it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

210
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,360
most popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so something</font>

211
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,620
interesting with Tetris is on when you

212
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,690
press the power button it actually goes

213
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,220
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pause mode so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pause on</font>

214
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,230
the buffer we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that in a</font>

215
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,820
sec push it again it goes into low-power

216
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,520
sleep mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually had my batteries</font>

217
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,840
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgrade badge since April and</font>

218
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,310
they still worked when I pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

219
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with this so the low-power</font>

220
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:36,780
sleep mode is really good the board has

221
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:39,180
a an accelerometer and accelerometers I

222
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,650
I was confusing accelerometers with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

223
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,989
scopes on the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they work so the</font>

224
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,990
accelerometers is like having<font color="#CCCCCC"> Springs</font>

225
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can detect which way the badge is</font>

226
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,680
pulling on those Springs so it's not

227
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">really like twisting I thought it was</font>

228
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,160
into twisting so at any rate you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

229
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
play around with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the interesting</font>

230
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,699
thing here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't find out myself</font>

231
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,670
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Devoy told me is that he built dice</font>

232
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,500
into it so while it's doing this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

233
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,819
shake it you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get random</font>

234
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,140
numbers and there's a random number

235
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,610
generator on there so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing</font>

236
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,420
games you can use his random number

237
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,750
generator that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> built in the</font>

238
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,579
the top button has us displaying message

239
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,639
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually change this message</font>

240
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:18,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the infrared there is a terminal</font>

241
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,950
computer to program the badge is that in

242
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:24,260
the badge hacking area yeah so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

243
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,699
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and write your own messages and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

244
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,649
can tell it you know what font and which

245
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:29,089
way to scroll and all that stuff we'll

246
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:31,850
go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a second how that works</font>

247
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:33,740
and the last one is on the bottom button

248
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,779
gives you your serial number<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

249
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,730
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the key for your badge to get</font>

250
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,380
infrared communication so that somebody

251
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't you know spam your badge with</font>

252
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,199
their own messages as far as programming

253
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">this the buffer which is again in that</font>

254
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:52,490
memory map but it's also at address x700

255
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,709
on it has a little translation anyone is

256
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,750
a non NE 0 isn't off and you basically

257
00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:00,018
right into this and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

258
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,089
the the badge display it on there is

259
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,980
another frame buffer which is used for

260
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pause mode so when you see the pause</font>

261
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,940
mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Tetris and it gives you your</font>

262
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,529
current score that's the other buffer

263
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,850
showing up so you can use that if you

264
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:15,500
want to have two buffers it's available

265
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,839
there is quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of information up</font>

266
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,380
here I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the most</font>

267
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,269
interesting if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do on you</font>

268
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,240
know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of medium to low level hacking</font>

269
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:31,250
is on this flag register looking at the

270
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:34,640
handshaking bits 1 and 0 here are tied

271
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:36,800
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> voice scanning interrupts so you</font>

272
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,600
can do very pretty accurate timing that

273
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,279
way and it's already running so you see

274
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,290
to check for those flags and then clear

275
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:47,560
them once you've read them in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

276
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:51,079
good timing the key edge is another one

277
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,630
so this key edge register allows you to

278
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,370
read bids 0 through 4 to see if the keys

279
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,709
have been pressed and again you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

280
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,779
clear that bit after you've read it so

281
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:01,790
you basically check has the UP<font color="#CCCCCC"> button</font>

282
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:06,350
been pushed yes it has all right set

283
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,730
that back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 and then on the colonel</font>

284
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,560
that's running in the bootloader space

285
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:14,779
will unload that up again ah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is of</font>

286
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,290
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of program memory grab my</font>

287
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:19,970
laser pointer here oh I'm totally going

288
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,349
to get this wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we started</font>

289
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reset vector</font>

290
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:28,220
and we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through our interrupts which</font>

291
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:31,130
somehow end up right here in user code

292
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,400
and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sea framework</font>

293
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:38,180
for this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UM you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle the</font>

294
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,920
interrupts by sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> them back to these</font>

295
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,250
addresses in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bootloader</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get that</font>

296
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost right and so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do want to</font>

297
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,030
I'm completely bypass the bootloader and

298
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,640
do all of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own hardware stuff you</font>

299
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">just don't send those interrupts back</font>

300
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,660
you use those interrupts whatever you

301
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,920
want to use them for but in this case if

302
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">you look at the sea framework it's</font>

303
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,849
already set up so that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

304
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,830
interrupts happen you can put code here

305
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,190
if you want to watch out because you

306
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:07,150
might mess up the display timing one of

307
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,710
the other features<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the badge is on</font>

308
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,720
dimming mode so if you hold both left

309
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,120
and right and then repeatedly press down

310
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,710
your badge will get dimmer or for you

311
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,780
repeatedly press up your badge will get

312
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,970
brighter and on this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

313
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> affect in your user code it's in</font>

314
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory map as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well so if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

315
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,640
make a game where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> better you do the</font>

316
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,830
brighter the display get sore the closer

317
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the fire ball gets you can change</font>

318
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:34,310
the global on brightness of the display

319
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,230
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty neat but if you're</font>

320
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">putting code in your interrupts here you</font>

321
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,250
might mess up the timing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

322
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,810
dimming so watch out for that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

323
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,360
weird behavior that's probably what it

324
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,969
is I know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I caused that in my</font>

325
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,260
user code and it was unfortunate in

326
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Belgrade but we fixed it now as for</font>

327
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,300
everything else running a loop in your

328
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:58,310
own code that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna run just fine</font>

329
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,930
the bootloader won't really interfere

330
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,430
with it other than stealing a few cycles

331
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,540
when it goes to service all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it all of</font>

332
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:07,459
the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually going to just</font>

333
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,250
go past this one this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I kind of went</font>

334
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this on keys on digging if you</font>

335
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,020
want again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the sea framework it</font>

336
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,050
shows you how to check that bit and

337
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,520
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this is the timing that I was</font>

338
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can check this flag</font>

339
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,860
register and you get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1200 her to</font>

340
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,020
150 hurts on these on and it's just

341
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,970
basically wait until one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these is set</font>

342
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,689
do your code<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then reset it's kind of</font>

343
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,769
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> software interrupts right it's your</font>

344
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,730
software

345
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,199
catching<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to those interrupts to</font>

346
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,089
synchronize with what the bootloader is

347
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,469
doing I think this one's pretty

348
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:41,540
interesting for anyone that wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

349
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,239
some communications with their badges so

350
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,399
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you have to do is wait</font>

351
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:48,769
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> this bed bit bit is set so that</font>

352
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,429
would be on the badge saying hey I'm

353
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:54,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">ready to transmit some data and once you</font>

354
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:56,299
see that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use this register right</font>

355
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,809
here again<font color="#E5E5E5"> its memory mapped put your</font>

356
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:01,459
data in there and then on the badge will

357
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:03,110
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and write it out it'll find</font>

358
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:05,689
that there's data they're ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

359
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,759
sent and it'll send it and then it'll

360
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:10,998
right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this again so you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just put</font>

361
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:14,749
a loop that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this until it</font>

362
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:17,379
is one and then um put your data in

363
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:24,799
there and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unset this</font>

364
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:32,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">gif to unset this bit okay all right</font>

365
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:34,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay excellent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and the next</font>

366
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:40,069
one's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be receiving so receiving</font>

367
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:42,709
is a little bit it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same so</font>

368
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:52,670
you want to watch this bit right here so

369
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:54,498
um you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set this bit 20 yes okay</font>

370
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,389
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set this bit 20 which says</font>

371
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:58,429
receive and you want to wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> until the</font>

372
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,769
flag is set which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

373
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:02,600
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you to read on it reads it</font>

374
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:05,629
into this data space again that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory</font>

375
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,470
mapped and you can pull that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out an</font>

376
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:11,779
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that on there is a</font>

377
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,850
length to the string you can have but

378
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:17,749
also there's a header so that's where

379
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,699
the number of the badge comes in so from

380
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:22,399
the stock firmware when you go down it

381
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:24,049
gives me badge number 170 my badge is

382
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,329
only going to list listen to a message

383
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,699
that has a header that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> that number</font>

384
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,248
and so the station the boy has set up to

385
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:33,229
write a new message<font color="#CCCCCC"> to badge it asks for</font>

386
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:35,419
your serial number so that it can add

387
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,699
that to the header so if you do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

388
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:39,139
do any bidirectional communication watch

389
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:43,248
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that header because that's how</font>

390
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:44,569
the bootloader runs it and then ending

391
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,529
is really simple you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to pause</font>

392
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:47,599
longer than

393
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:52,430
milliseconds and then it assumes that on

394
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,810
it got the full message and the you know

395
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,459
all this stuff is handle automatically

396
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,709
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> letter so you don't have to</font>

397
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,779
worry about actually this one's handled

398
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:02,170
it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware because it's a try Seaver</font>

399
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,760
module so you don't have to worry about

400
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,129
you know decoding the message itself you

401
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:14,030
just get something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in memories that you</font>

402
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:15,199
can read off which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice so the I</font>

403
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,389
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about pause mode a little bit</font>

404
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,159
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I'm going to skip by that</font>

405
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,250
one this is really interesting so the

406
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:23,449
the accelerometer is fun to play with

407
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,549
and you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something really simple</font>

408
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,799
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> really clever like I think</font>

409
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:29,840
the shaking is really clever for this

410
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">batch because it is it's very easy to</font>

411
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,470
see that the shaking is distinct look if

412
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,389
you if you don't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right it</font>

413
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,650
doesn't come on and that's good behavior

414
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:42,799
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that boy is doing that is</font>

415
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:46,580
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bootloader right to these to</font>

416
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:51,379
these 16-bit variables now the least

417
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:55,030
significant nibble of the lower bit is

418
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:59,450
empty on and then we start with the

419
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:03,230
least significant values and so you get

420
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:06,370
a 12-bit value but the bottom two bits

421
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:09,380
are really noisy that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 through 4</font>

422
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:11,209
that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 through three on and so you</font>

423
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,760
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually just leave those bits off</font>

424
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:17,330
and in my testing actually left<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

425
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,490
read the top one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for my on you know</font>

426
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,889
for my use of just being like are you

427
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,330
tilting one way or the other it was

428
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,220
perfectly fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> so play around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with out a</font>

429
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,220
bit on one of the things I thought was

430
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,260
interesting is I just mapped all six of

431
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,610
these to the display and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then played</font>

432
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,200
around with it for a while so you can

433
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,750
kind of do your prototyping by just like

434
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,260
what LEDs are lit up and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

435
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:42,860
fun um there is yeah there's a function

436
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:46,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">call so you need to do I didn't assembly</font>

437
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,260
go to command you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it in the in</font>

438
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:50,030
the sea framework and I actually wrapped

439
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,658
it in something so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just call a c</font>

440
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:56,450
function on but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically say</font>

441
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:58,830
hey go out and and run this subroutine

442
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,870
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull over those two</font>

443
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,250
lines for the accelerometer dump this

444
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,000
into memory and you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and</font>

445
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,289
do what you want with it the same is

446
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,610
true for the pseudo-random number

447
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:12,629
generator so it's a it's a subroutine in

448
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,149
protected bootloader space so all you

449
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,580
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is make a call boy it does</font>

450
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:20,010
have the timing here so is 79 cycles in

451
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,139
order to a call<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of a messy</font>

452
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,908
programmer so I was like I'll call<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

453
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,620
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually it'll just be</font>

454
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:32,070
there and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these addresses x</font>

455
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,229
7 33 x 7 33 and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe those are</font>

456
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,230
actually the seed values to it

457
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,700
overwrites the seed is that right yeah

458
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,029
so you're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

459
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,070
place you can you can on instantiate a

460
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,990
seed if you want or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just go with</font>

461
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,100
what's there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then you can read that</font>

462
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,769
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's going to be your suit</font>

463
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,418
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number you get 32 bits so if</font>

464
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,760
you're if you're you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing</font>

465
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:55,049
simple game stuff and not cryptography

466
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,450
anybody I would love it if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

467
00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:01,260
crazy cryptography on their badge so I'm

468
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,779
please do just as a just as a straw poll

469
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">here I has anybody here tried decrypt of</font>

470
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,320
challenge yet have you flashed the

471
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,399
crypto challenge or a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> people okay</font>

472
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:14,939
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it past at least one</font>

473
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:18,510
challenge at least two challenges solved

474
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,880
three challenges solved for challenges

475
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,169
no not<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet so it looks like rich is on</font>

476
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,659
number four right there you can go and

477
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:29,429
bribe him for hints if you want don't

478
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:30,630
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> him rich I and my my advice to is</font>

479
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,980
as you solve those write down your

480
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,470
answers because otherwise you're not

481
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,549
going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flash a hacked firm on</font>

482
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,169
your badge because you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

483
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,330
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the challenges but I'm super</font>

484
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,169
fun there<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright what else do we have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">looked oh so for the super crazy</font>

486
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:46,350
embedded people who want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

487
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,899
close to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metal on this can be</font>

488
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,309
programmed with a pic kit and actually

489
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:51,570
have one if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> borrow it I'm</font>

490
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:54,178
guessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have some of the badge</font>

491
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,000
packing area as well um but you are

492
00:20:54,179 --> 00:21:01,799
going to be you know setting up all of

493
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,179
the you know hardware servicing stuffed

494
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,168
it's in the boot loader if you blow that

495
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,909
out you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to take care of</font>

496
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that yourself so good luck I only know</font>

497
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">one person that did it was Mike Harrison</font>

498
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,460
of Mike's electric things Mike's

499
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,990
electric stuff which one is it

500
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:20,010
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike's electric stuff and Belgrade</font>

501
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:22,230
came and did uh 16 levels of gray scale

502
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,820
and and did all kinds of animations and

503
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,620
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool but he also worked</font>

504
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">on it for you know a few days before he</font>

505
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,429
got there so challenge accepted will be

506
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,900
here late tonight please give that a try

507
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:35,670
yourself right and just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you a</font>

508
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">little example of how the bootloader is</font>

509
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,110
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> working so again it's got on</font>

510
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,640
it's got this code that's running and

511
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,050
when it hits into bootloader mode it

512
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,390
takes what's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the USB and it</font>

513
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:49,919
puts it into this space starting at an

514
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:51,210
offset of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 X</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3300 you Dom with your own</font>

515
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,620
program you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be blowing that</font>

516
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,230
bootloader out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what this show</font>

517
00:21:52,620 --> 00:22:00,270
is showing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

518
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:04,380
show you the animated gifs that's not

519
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:06,720
animated and the pages this was showing

520
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the example what the sea on framework is</font>

521
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,100
going to do which it starts off with one

522
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,900
pixel highlighted and if you press the

523
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,610
buttons it move to that pixel around

524
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:19,050
there'll be two rows that are blinking

525
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:20,580
at what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> approximately one hurt and</font>

526
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,080
then on the bottom there's an arrow left

527
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,939
or right and so when you open up that

528
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,889
framework it's very simple it just says

529
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,540
this is how you do non-blocking timing

530
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,920
this is how you read from the

531
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,930
accelerometer this is how you write to

532
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">the display</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is how you use</font>

533
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,830
buttons up down left right anyone who's

534
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,720
done any sort of programming can look at

535
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and be like this is simple and mecha</font>

536
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,320
doesn't know what he's doing which is

537
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine because I don't and then anybody</font>

538
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,159
who hasn't done it before seriously look

539
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,409
to your left look to your right both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

540
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,390
those people be happy to you know help

541
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,760
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your feet wet if you haven't</font>

542
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,140
blinked an LED you can't leave this

543
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,620
weekend without doing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

work on this badge I think it really

548
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes the event special and I know I've</font>

549
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,770
already wasted way too much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my time</font>

550
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,850
before we got here playing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>
