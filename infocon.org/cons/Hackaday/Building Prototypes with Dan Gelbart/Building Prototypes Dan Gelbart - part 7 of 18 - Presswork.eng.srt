1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,530
okay in this section we'll talk a little

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:15,250
bit about press walk and not every small

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,990
but if you have a press there's a lot of

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,080
useful things you can do is it now the

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,610
first thing you have to know about

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,980
presses that the deceiving looks because

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,689
it's one of the most dangerous machines

8
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,628
in the shop now the reason why a press

9
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:36,379
is such a dangerous machine that if you

10
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:39,620
compress a piece of steel it stores up a

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,320
lot of energy if this is a brittle

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,750
material it can suddenly share tail and

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,930
all this energy is released at once now

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,360
everybody can imagine if you take it a

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,750
big truck spring and bend it in to when

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,320
it snaps open you can kill a person but

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,410
you don't think of it that if you take a

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,629
block of steel which has the same way to

19
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,190
say attack spring and you compress it

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,270
too near it's a strength limit it stores

21
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,729
up more energies and a bent-over talk

22
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,710
spring because it's not truck spring is

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,140
not stressed as a limit so if you take a

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,990
piece of steel same weight compress it

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,770
here say 100 tonnes and it shatters it

26
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,700
will release an energy much more than a

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,979
cartilage from a rifle okay

28
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,060
and certainly can kill a person

29
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,369
instantly and you have to remember when

30
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,110
a piece of steel shells because of say

31
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,390
Poisson ratio the forces have not just

32
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,429
up and down the forces are also sideways

33
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,289
it shatters and pieces fly that shrapnel

34
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,990
in all directions so the first word of a

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,679
Perez is never press a hardened piece or

36
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,229
a brittle piece because it will store up

37
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,060
all the energy and if it shatters it

38
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,099
will just fly like a shrapnel like a

39
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:02,140
hand grenade even if you compress

40
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,149
ductile materials sometimes you're using

41
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,160
tooling and the tooling may be a bit

42
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,739
hard so there's always a risk the press

43
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,030
itself is hardened so if the best thing

44
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,860
you can do if you are if you have any

45
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,569
doubts at all is provide a shield exists

46
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,120
made of half inch polycarbonate because

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,160
the polycarbonate is shatterproof

48
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,030
okay so anything anything except

49
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,580
pressing sheetmetal should really be

50
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,250
done with a shield in place that's very

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,320
very important the second thing which is

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,790
very important to know about the press

53
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,340
that if you take a very little piece

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,700
like a dime and put it in and put the

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,530
full force on it will damage the press

56
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,480
because the reason is you'll have the

57
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,700
hundred tons all concentrated on the

58
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,560
area of a dime even if the time will

59
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,920
expand a bit you have a hundred tons say

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,570
concentrated on maybe two square

61
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,390
centimeters which by far exceeds the

62
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,970
yield strength of the best steel because

63
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,470
they're going to get 50 tons per square

64
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,810
centimeter and most Steel's will yield

65
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,420
at about 20 tons or ten times per square

66
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,160
centimeter so it will make a dent in the

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,040
press so even a washer made of aluminum

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,680
if you put it in the press and you press

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,900
it to the limit of the force will damage

70
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,420
the place so you always have to think

71
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,730
that if this press is a hundred ton and

72
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,190
this is made of steel and to take a

73
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,170
safety factor or should not be loaded

74
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,210
more than say 10 tons per square

75
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,080
centimeter

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,750
you cannot apply the full force or you

77
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,610
shouldn't actually press something with

78
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,240
an area less than 10 square centimeters

79
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,710
otherwise if by mistake you applied more

80
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,500
force it will then suppress and keep you

81
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,390
in crack it okay so it's kind of a very

82
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,820
unintuitive things that even if you put

83
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,950
in a bit of plastic okay

84
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,620
piece of wood which is very small and

85
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,090
you compress it you'll damage the press

86
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,610
so this is a 2 6 people don't think

87
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,459
about but I want to emphasize again the

88
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,570
real danger here

89
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,300
if epsilon and Li you put in a piece of

90
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,240
hardened steel okay and you compress it

91
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,430
it's guaranteed to share there and it's

92
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,110
just a matter of luck if the shrapnel

93
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,660
will give you or not so you should

94
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,800
beware aware of it

95
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,860
okay so what what is the press good form

96
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,220
a plus by itself is mainly good for

97
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,260
straightening and flattening and things

98
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,090
like this but the press in conjunction

99
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,130
with the waterjet there's a great

100
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,140
combination because if you have a

101
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,090
waterjet next to it you can cut the

102
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,030
tooling so if you need special shapes in

103
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,710
minutes you can cut the tooling on the

104
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,409
waterjet from a plate of mild steel

105
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,269
and then put in the press and press

106
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:40,610
these shapes out in sheet metal now this

107
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,199
is especially important if you're

108
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,149
wanting to make very high-performance

109
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,099
structures like you want to make some

110
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,959
air bomb things if you know want to make

111
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,999
light weight very high performance

112
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,809
lightweight structures then the best way

113
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,489
to get stiffness in lightweight

114
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:58,789
structures is to use closed form pieces

115
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:01,209
the same ways the car gets its rigidity

116
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:08,569
so basically if I if I take two strips

117
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:11,839
of metal or one strip the thickness of

118
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,309
two and I just keep it flat I can easily

119
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:19,009
bend it it's basically no no rigidity

120
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,629
and no strings okay and basically vended

121
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:27,409
but if I press in a rib okay

122
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,599
then immediately the moment of inertia

123
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,699
goes up of course and then the strength

124
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,919
goes up but the best thing is closed

125
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,709
form because if I just burned it up like

126
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:40,129
this without the press it's also very

127
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:42,289
strong this way but it's not strong

128
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:45,110
torsionally I can still twist it but to

129
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,610
get it so unfortunately you need a

130
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,999
closed shape so if you press it or the

131
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:54,289
press to ribs okay and then spot weld

132
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,209
around the edge you end up with

133
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,829
something which is exactly the same

134
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,659
weight okay

135
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,240
but it's stiffened bending it's stiff

136
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,349
torsionally okay so if you really

137
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,239
concerned about lightweight strong

138
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,489
structures you probably need to use

139
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:14,979
presses Samuel pressing ribs okay and

140
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,869
the material could be ease of stainless

141
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:20,089
called a nice steel but if you mean you

142
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,860
really need high-performance structures

143
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,979
the best material to use is some

144
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:29,269
stainless steels which can be heat

145
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,939
treated after forming so if you look at

146
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,849
something like seventeen seven stainless

147
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:37,489
or some other alloys like this which can

148
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:39,829
be hard and just by heat reading cycles

149
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,769
they don't need quenching so what you do

150
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,260
is you press it out in their need for

151
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,210
spot-welded finish and then you put the

152
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,850
whole thing in the oven for the

153
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,140
temperature cycle and then it comes out

154
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,110
with a very high elastic range so even

155
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,170
if you bend it was spring back okay so

156
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,260
so what is so again so for normal

157
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,750
structures steel is the best this is

158
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,120
powder coated and but for real high

159
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,580
performance structures some of the

160
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,280
stainless steels which are annealed and

161
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,560
get hardened with a simple heat

162
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,740
treatment cycle of the best for example

163
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,320
this is a lightweight box so it needed

164
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,990
some reinforcement on the cover so you

165
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,490
cut on the waterjet two layers one layer

166
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,500
which is the X with these tabs and other

167
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,260
layers just the back spot welds them

168
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,230
together and then you just put a piece

169
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,270
of metal over it and press the shape

170
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,560
which I'll show in a minute

171
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,560
now that now this is still much faster

172
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,410
than going on a CNC mill and milling out

173
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,840
this pattern because the main thing is

174
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,190
when you mail it you have to find a way

175
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,840
to clamp it in you have to worry about a

176
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,640
lot of things with the waterjet you just

177
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,650
cut it to pieces spot weld them together

178
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,120
and you're done in five minutes now

179
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
another example I need a press is if you

180
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,790
want to make cylindrical boxes because

181
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,030
usually if you want to make like a some

182
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,010
drum or some any kind of sail in there

183
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,360
you need a round covers its ends and

184
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,430
it's a round covers they have to have a

185
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,440
lip then top so you can spot weld around

186
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,150
it and the way you do that is you make

187
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,610
yourself a set of tooling like this the

188
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,200
beauty of the water jet it gives your

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,110
male and female the same time but you

190
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,700
have to have a bit more clearance and

191
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,820
you sink so let's say if the material is

192
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,460
one millimeters thick the clearance

193
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,760
should be about one and a half or two

194
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,470
all around because if you make it

195
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,909
there's no clear end it'll jump together

196
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,229
you would be able to get it out again

197
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,500
okay so here you put the sheet metal

198
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,820
over it and which I'll show you

199
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,160
immediately the steps and then you press

200
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,140
it and then it comes out as ugly edges

201
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,600
so just send the edges to get a nice

202
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,950
disco do later so I want to show you

203
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,550
exactly

204
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,620
to do it because a big trick in pressing

205
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,140
if you have a male and female is how do

206
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,029
you line them up because you have a

207
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:08,300
sheet metal in between say if I want to

208
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,839
press out a cup and if I miss places a

209
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,519
little bit I'm just willing everything

210
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,100
go in the tool knowing the job so the

211
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,800
trick is how to align it so I want to

212
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,370
show you this is done so as a exercise

213
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,279
we have a piece of sin steel about half

214
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,070
a millimeter and we want to stiffen it

215
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,250
by some ribs and we decided we want to

216
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,070
rip to go all around okay so the way you

217
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,630
do that you can press in two methods one

218
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,110
method is press just was a main tool

219
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,700
against rubber the rubber way push it in

220
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,410
oh oh if you want to push it in very

221
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,140
well you do it against lead and the

222
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,970
other way to do it is a male and female

223
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,880
okay so we'll do both ways and you also

224
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,399
see the difference so the first way is I

225
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,680
just go on the water jet cut out the

226
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,660
shape of a rib I want okay hey back it

227
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,820
up with some material that's a little

228
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,209
bit too small

229
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,800
brad has to be it's very hard right

230
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,440
they're all very hot fully USA which is

231
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,300
the best okay

232
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,850
but even this is a little bit too small

233
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,790
but anyway we'll have that's what we

234
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,300
have okay so you line it up and all that

235
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,370
you have to and then now it doesn't

236
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,050
matter there's no alignment if you just

237
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,730
press up all the material okay put it in

238
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,620
it's important to put it in the middle

239
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,140
of the press because you don't want to

240
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,839
then try to bend the press but in the

241
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,959
middle of the press because it's sheet

242
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,100
metal you can get away without the God

243
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:54,130
okay so and the other thing is correct

244
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,070
and you give it to 400 pants

245
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,500
okay so what is that it is a nice rib

246
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,900
but it doesn't have such sharp

247
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,150
definition but most of the time that's

248
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,840
enough

249
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,480
earlier it actually snaps why doesn't it

250
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,340
snaps because the rubber was too small

251
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,200
it didn't cover the edges so the edges

252
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,180
wrinkled the rubber has to be bigger

253
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,370
than the metal but only it doesn't have

254
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,110
such high definition although this may

255
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,710
be sufficient for a shape but now you

256
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,320
can press them with male and female

257
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,460
because now you already have something

258
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,250
which will register the two halves so

259
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:49,440
now what you do is you put this down to

260
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,550
make its necklace so now you can put

261
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,790
this down you can put down the male on

262
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,830
the inside that's going to be registered

263
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,860
and you can put down the female on the

264
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,530
other side too so you put it like this

265
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,000
to make sure it really sits in the

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,550
groove okay and then race on it like

267
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,480
this okay and now you know that it's

268
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,200
going to be registered

269
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,740
okay and if it was anything as of the

270
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,300
sheet metal of the car

271
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,950
give it the full hundred tons

272
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:09,949
the difference is that now I'm getting

273
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,379
much sharper lines because now it has a

274
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,420
mailing female and also now you can do a

275
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,279
deep hole if you wanted to raise it like

276
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,199
a whole centimeter now if you want to go

277
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,819
any deeper - oh it hurts would be

278
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:22,819
annealed meaning get it red-hot and let

279
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:25,189
it cool down now if you want to do a

280
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:28,069
real complex shape you may have to do a

281
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,559
double draw for example if you just had

282
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,990
to be very deep loan you'll draw it fair

283
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,999
say with a half inch thick which you can

284
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,980
still devote in one throw and then

285
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,689
anneal it and then draw it as a one-inch

286
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:41,720
thick die because if you try to put it

287
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,600
down in one inch at one time it'll tail

288
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,189
just like stunning industry weather

289
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:47,720
depending on the ductility of the

290
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,370
material you sometimes need to an

291
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,249
in-between okay but you can pass very

292
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,949
nice shapes like this and as you see the

293
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:58,040
tooling is very simple so if I wanted to

294
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,000
do this for one turtle to press a circle

295
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,980
in this I would have done the same I

296
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,500
would have pressed it first against

297
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,990
Robin in order to get a rough shape and

298
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,089
then this rough shape will allow me to

299
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:13,490
align the male and the female and then

300
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,240
through an accurate shape so if I as I

301
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,120
said if you want to press it in one step

302
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,949
with sharp detail you have to press it

303
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:24,170
into red and the lot of course can be

304
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,629
reused by melting it again so if I

305
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,730
wanted to press the shape into this I

306
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,519
will just put a sheet of lead maybe half

307
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,589
you take under it now you have to be a

308
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:35,629
bit careful because if this is steel and

309
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:38,120
has sharp corners these corners are not

310
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,610
rounded it may actually she'll because

311
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,290
there's no big difference with the shear

312
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,029
and the press if I wanted to sheer it

313
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:45,740
out I would really make this part

314
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,439
hardened with sharp corners I would

315
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:50,569
press it into a bottle lid and actually

316
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:52,339
punch out the part which is also useful

317
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,259
if you want many many parts and you just

318
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,269
punch them out so right now this is

319
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:59,920
actually the corners of baby shower so

320
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,990
I'm not sure I'm not sure what it will

321
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,620
do was

322
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,230
we'll press o here but we can see okay

323
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:15,310
reported in try to Center it

324
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,020
yeah now it pressed it so you can see it

325
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,910
pressed it out and with not their

326
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,500
definition I could have pressed I

327
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,150
pressed it a little bit more because

328
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,790
it's still around the edge if I example

329
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,770
in two areas just too big but you also

330
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,780
notice something interesting because I

331
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,060
didn't round the edges it was on the

332
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,100
borderline between pressing and shearing

333
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,370
and you can see it one-handed shield if

334
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,200
you look at this end it actually shield

335
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,360
because one end was sharper than others

336
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,340
all the other tooling here have a

337
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,860
rounded edge so you can see you can use

338
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,170
it as a very nice precise shield if this

339
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,860
was hardened
