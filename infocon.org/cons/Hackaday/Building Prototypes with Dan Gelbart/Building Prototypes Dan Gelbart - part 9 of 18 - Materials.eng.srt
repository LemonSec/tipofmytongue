1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,290
okay in this section we want

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,660
materials materials obviously is a huge

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,790
subject and the hundreds of very useful

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,150
materials but if I have to say what are

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,570
the minimal supply of materials a shop

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,230
of a lab should keep I will summarize it

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,880
in what is here on the table and I'll

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,119
explain what the materials are so as we

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,300
said everything you can make out of cold

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,720
old mild steel sheets should be done

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,360
that way because its strongest achieve

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,860
maybe not the strongest but it's strong

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,170
it's cheap it's readily available you

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,110
can spot weld it it works beautifully

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,930
was bending in water jet so they the

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,090
general basic material everything should

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,600
be made of is mild steel core and if you

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,440
had to only stock two sizes or two

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,890
sicknesses of sheets I would stock a

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,709
gauge eighteen and engage 10 gauge

21
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,000
eighteen is about one point two

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
millimeter gauge ten is a bit of a three

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,750
millimeter and obviously more gauges are

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,790
helpful but if you'll take a

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,010
minimalistic approach with these two

26
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,070
gauges you cover 95% of what you will be

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,310
building the heavy gauge the gauge 10 is

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,670
for making the brackets basis massive

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,070
assemblies and all the rest can be made

30
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,590
from gauge 18 now the same is true for

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,030
stainless I would stock a serious 300

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,790
stainless as this you know stainless

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,700
comes in 300 series and 400 series I

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,650
would stop here cheapest 300 series

35
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,390
stainless again gauge 18 engage 12 maybe

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,979
not 10 because stainless is very

37
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,470
expensive so a sheet of gauge 10

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,479
stainless there's hundreds of dollars so

39
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,299
so this is gauge 18 this is about gauge

40
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,640
12 I would stock a these two sizes and

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,140
that's all what I need now in stainless

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,489
I would stock two other versions I would

43
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,030
stock some stainless in a steel stem in

44
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,549
a spring temper because it's very

45
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:16,860
convenient to be able to make spring

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,379
simply by cutting out a sheet which is

47
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,740
already spring temper so

48
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,220
spring temple stainless this is types

49
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,110
Rio one full hard but you can buy others

50
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,180
spring temple stainless the nice thing

51
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,650
about these series 300 in spring temple

52
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,750
that you can still shear them with a

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,730
shear you can still bend them if you

54
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,770
have to all those are springy but it

55
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,030
will still take a bend without breaking

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,240
for example here you can still bend it

57
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,250
it doesn't break but it's still springy

58
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,240
now you can also buy half a 400 series

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,210
spring tempered stainless but it cannot

60
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,280
be sheared it can be bent so it's more

61
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,610
complicated to use so so as a general

62
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,030
purpose playing material I would store

63
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,310
serious 300 stainless is 301 or some

64
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,970
other 300 series in a full hard or 3/4

65
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,540
hard temper the best place to buy is a

66
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,060
spring tempered stainless is from a

67
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,300
company called side cuts calm which send

68
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,520
you the ends of walls when they slit the

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,130
wide wall the end up with like 4 inch to

70
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,470
10 inch wide leftovers and they serve

71
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,940
them quite cheap and that's all that you

72
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,710
ever need

73
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,750
now and the other type of stainless link

74
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,660
temper I would store is something called

75
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,650
a 17-7 stainless steel and this is a

76
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,260
type which is it comes a kneeled it's

77
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,330
very very soft you can see comes

78
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,910
annealed but if you do a heat rating

79
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,850
cycle in the oven it becomes very hard a

80
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,600
very springy

81
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,250
much harder much spring gear than the

82
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,080
spring tempo so it's probably the

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,450
strongest in spring your stainless steel

84
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,560
is a race and the heat cycle you have to

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,420
follow manufacturer's instructions but

86
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,490
typically it's you heat it up to 760

87
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,460
degrees let it cool down completely and

88
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,860
heat it up again to about five hundred

89
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,870
eighty degrees or some number like that

90
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,988
and let it cool down again so it's no

91
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,630
quenching just double heating and then

92
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,550
it becomes very very springy and hard

93
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,560
which means you can do all the forming

94
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,570
bending spot welding and everything in

95
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,000
the malleable state then you take the

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,780
whole piece

97
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,200
harden it and because

98
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,020
Stormin Squiggy so these are basically

99
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,570
the types of stainless I would store I

100
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,750
would also if you want to stock a bars

101
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,540
and words I would always buys a free

102
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,970
machining type because well steel and

103
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,920
stainless come in regular and free

104
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,710
machining free machining is achieved by

105
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,020
adding lead or soul for some other

106
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,990
alloying element it cost a little bit

107
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,380
more

108
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,570
it's an enormous difference at machining

109
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,180
time and surface finish so since you're

110
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,310
not going to need thousands of piles

111
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,340
just need one the extra few cents in the

112
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,890
material cost will pay back in machining

113
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,230
time so try to stock all the bar stock

114
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,580
and plate and everything in free

115
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,740
machining

116
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,690
now the other metal you should stock

117
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,840
some of is aluminum a four large stock

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,930
chairs and be in sheets for heat sinks

119
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,260
because of a copper is better but copper

120
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,000
is expensive aluminum is a very good

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,760
all-purpose material for heat sinks if I

122
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,030
had to stock just one size I would stalk

123
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,200
a maybe gauge ten or twelve in an L

124
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,340
recalled 50:52 now the advantage of

125
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,370
fifty fifty two that it can be bent

126
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,550
without cracking the more popular alloy

127
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,920
is probably six to sixty one but if you

128
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,100
bend it will crack now if you I just

129
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,990
bend this and if you zoom here you can

130
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,930
see the crack at the bend since a lot of

131
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,230
heat sinks have to have to be bent to

132
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,010
increase the surface area it's better to

133
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,800
use fifty fifty two so I wouldn't even

134
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,280
bother stockings in aluminum because

135
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,540
except for heat sinks I don't see much

136
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,440
use for it now

137
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,800
another type of material which is good

138
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,130
to stock a spring wire now most people

139
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,050
for some reason don't think of making

140
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,240
their own Springs but your Springs come

141
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,970
in many many forms and you always need a

142
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,800
spring in shapes that you don't have in

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,080
your drawer where it's very very easy to

144
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,880
make your own spring so if you stock

145
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,240
maybe just three four sizes of wire you

146
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,610
can instantly make your own Springs both

147
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,250
compression and tension and the way you

148
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,940
do that

149
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,370
all that you have to do is you just grip

150
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,060
the wire in the Chuck together with a

151
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,150
manual like this you can just bend the

152
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,550
wire put it in the Chuck of it of grip

153
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,890
it together of the mandrel let's see the

154
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,700
direction okay and you just hold it like

155
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,330
this I just start it off a bit slow and

156
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:13,740
then just to grip it and now that's it

157
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,640
and now cut it off watch your hands when

158
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,680
you cut off the spring it was swinging

159
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,170
around okay take it out and now you just

160
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,060
have to finish the ends if it's a

161
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,480
tension spring I will just bend the ends

162
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,170
like this

163
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,780
okay so basically this thing takes less

164
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,400
time than going through your doorway

165
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,130
looking for the right spring

166
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,020
okay another style of finishing

167
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,040
attention spring it's even faster

168
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,690
another style of finishing attention

169
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,820
splaying you just take one time you

170
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,670
separate one time and you just bend it

171
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,610
at 90 degrees and that's it so this is a

172
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,550
tension spring okay if you want to turn

173
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,380
it into a compression spring it's even

174
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,130
easier

175
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,170
it just takes a tension spring you just

176
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,340
made over stretch it out of the ends and

177
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,750
now you got a compression spring okay

178
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,990
now you got a compression spring okay so

179
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,270
as you can see this thing takes seconds

180
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,520
so instead of always looking for the

181
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,770
right spring just have a few coils of

182
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,919
spring wire again this wire as two types

183
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,350
one is what's called music why music

184
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,659
likes carbon steel if you don't need

185
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,140
rust proofing corrosion resistance it's

186
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,850
the cheapest way and it's available in

187
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,790
all sizes now if you need corrosion

188
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,040
resistance you should use the same alloy

189
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,640
as this 17 7 you can buy all the wire

190
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,910
sizes and 17 7 stainless you wind the

191
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,450
spring now this wire when it's wire it

192
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,580
only needs one heating cycle not tool

193
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,960
because it's slightly different

194
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,450
methodological II so it's already pre

195
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,490
treated so what you do once you made the

196
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,710
spring you put it over and according to

197
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,690
manufacturer's instructions typically

198
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,840
its 560 no sorry 480 degrees this one

199
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,900
the wire goes 480 degrees Celsius or one

200
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,480
hour but always follow manufacturer's

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,860
instructions because in different

202
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,200
temples and the temple of the annealing

203
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,110
determines the heat cycle okay so a

204
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,490
basically three types of stainless plus

205
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,300
say mellow in why ever so 17-7 and

206
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,859
that's all what you need okay now

207
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,370
let's talk a little bit about non metals

208
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,730
and other materials so if I have to

209
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,900
choose a minimalistic list of what

210
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,760
plastics I will keep so the first one is

211
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,220
something you mentioned many times

212
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,350
polycarbonate or lexan it's a very very

213
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,390
good material it's completely

214
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,760
shatterproof which is quite amazing you

215
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,000
can hit it with a hammer with a bullet

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,890
you can bend it it takes a fairly high

217
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,050
temperature 100 degrees at least so it's

218
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,320
a very good material all around now and

219
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,900
that's a very good all-around material

220
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,310
is acetal known mainly by the trade name

221
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,510
delle Vigne

222
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,790
okay so this is why delle Vigne it also

223
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,950
comes in black it's a plastic which

224
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,830
machines the nicest of all plastics it's

225
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,990
fairly inexpensive available in all

226
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,330
shapes so it's a good supply of delving

227
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,010
in plate and odd it's very good a sort

228
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,470
plastic which most people actually are

229
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,150
not familiar with but it's very useful

230
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,930
is phenolic laminate now this is sold

231
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,610
under different trade names

232
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,270
it's like gamma light or phenolic or

233
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,890
whatever what it is it's a very original

234
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,830
plastic which is phenolic resin and

235
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,380
layers of cotton fabric laminated

236
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,100
together now it is it has some

237
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,710
advantages of a normal plastic first of

238
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,770
all it doesn't easily deform with heat

239
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,230
because it's a composite basically the

240
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,470
fabric all these plastics is they have a

241
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,480
melting point but they will actually

242
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,850
deform much below the melting point in

243
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,490
phenomena called creep if you put them

244
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,280
at say 70 degrees C for a long time they

245
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,580
will creep now this doesn't creep it's a

246
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,530
it doesn't break machines very

247
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,110
beautifully and it has another very it

248
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,820
holds threads very well which those

249
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,860
don't but it has another very

250
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,410
interesting property because it has the

251
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,140
cotton inside as a phenolic it can

252
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,560
absorb oil so when you make a moving

253
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,780
part out of it they will lubricate

254
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,360
themselves very well so if you lubricate

255
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,590
it once

256
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,410
it will absorb some of the oil so this

257
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,570
material is used heavily in gears and

258
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,570
bearings and you can see many sinks you

259
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,850
take apart when you have a steel gear

260
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,100
running against a phenolic gear and this

261
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,930
combination lasts forever it doesn't

262
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,850
wear and it runs quieter than metal

263
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,150
against metal gears for example this is

264
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,950
a small phenolic gear out of an

265
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,350
instrument but you can see this phenolic

266
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,410
gears and even large gears so it's

267
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,270
strong enough to make your T's and

268
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,940
itself and it's once you dip it in oil

269
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,740
or once oiled once it'll keep little

270
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,180
getting itself forever so this is

271
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,240
phenolic now another material which has

272
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,730
good lubricity is teflon that you all

273
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,480
know well a teflon also stands a fairly

274
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,520
high temperature it's usable to almost

275
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,030
200 degree C it's a weak material it

276
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,340
flows cold flows it's weak it doesn't

277
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,960
hold threads there's very good

278
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,510
electrical properties heavily used

279
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,910
everything in RF work if you need some

280
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,920
coils anything to do with high frequency

281
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,540
but it's actually not a very useful

282
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,750
plastic because it's too weak it's use

283
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,340
it sometimes or bushings which you don't

284
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,310
have to be highly loaded but Steph LOM

285
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,780
now a very cheap plastic is PVC and

286
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,990
another cheap plastic is abs and both of

287
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,080
them can be also glued together with a

288
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,270
solvent based glue which is all what

289
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,030
plumbers use when you do PVC piping or

290
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,920
ABS piping you can buy the solvent based

291
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,440
glue for it in any hardware store so you

292
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,100
can make big box as big structures which

293
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,740
glue the joints which are very strong so

294
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,590
this is a low temperature material it's

295
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,590
not good for anything maybe even 70 C or

296
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,860
80 seats already pretty weak but it's

297
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,750
very cheap and it's very very available

298
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,210
and main thing available in pipes so if

299
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,100
you need a lot of pipes and anyhow it'll

300
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,880
store you can buy pipes made of that it

301
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,440
doesn't hold threads you have to put

302
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,570
inserts like I showed in lexan helical

303
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,600
inserts but it's for just bulky sinks if

304
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,760
you want to make a big plastic tank and

305
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,800
basically if you can't use metal if it

306
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,270
has to be plastic

307
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,240
big enclosures cheap so these are more

308
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,160
expensive materials are very cheap

309
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,050
material now there is one plastic which

310
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,870
is very expensive but very exotic and

311
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,800
good you should stock and this is

312
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,280
polyamide and polyamide known as a trade

313
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,480
name Vespa okay it's available the very

314
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,580
polemic is available acetate which is

315
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,750
very useful and this bulk material I

316
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,370
quads or plates the tape can take up to

317
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,000
300 degree C so it's a highest rated

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,690
highest temperature rated polymerase so

319
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,610
it's very good for electrical insulation

320
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,240
it also has it has good peaceful

321
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,280
resistance one of the problems with

322
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,920
plastics if you insulate something

323
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,350
electrically and you have some hot

324
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,720
corner leaning against it it'll slowly

325
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,150
cut through the insulation now this is

326
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,040
very good cut school resistance that's

327
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,660
why it's so good for electrical and

328
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,370
temperature okay and it's available as

329
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,310
bulk material under the trade name Vespa

330
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,930
made by DuPont either a virgin and in

331
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,570
brown shape or field field is there with

332
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,380
carbon or filled with a moly MOS tool

333
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,950
filled with different materials to make

334
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,680
it a better bearing material so this is

335
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,310
an amazing material it can regularly

336
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,950
walk at 300 C okay

337
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,870
it holds threads very well it's very

338
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,180
rigid it doesn't distort it hole shapes

339
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,670
very well it has only one catch it's

340
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,190
terribly expensive a piece like this

341
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,380
could be maybe a hundred box or

342
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,910
something like that so it's a very very

343
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,730
very expensive material but you have to

344
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,680
know it exists so if you need a part

345
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,100
which has to be very good mechanically

346
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,540
insulating in high temperature you don't

347
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,570
have much choice okay so this is West

348
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,440
Bell now I forgot to mention actually

349
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,900
one other useful material to stock a

350
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,510
little bit off in metals and this is

351
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,580
bearing bonds if you have to make

352
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,510
anything which slides on steel

353
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,060
the best combination to slide on steel

354
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,850
is bronze not brass what bronze huge

355
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,220
difference in performance so you can buy

356
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,800
bonds plates bonds odds and you just use

357
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
a little bit of it for the bushing go

358
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,540
away or paid and if you make part of

359
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,340
this against hardened steel and

360
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,850
lubricated to last forever

361
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,460
okay now in terms of other materials it

362
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,320
is a lock tight that everybody knows

363
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,480
which is very useful for tight fits like

364
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,700
putting bearings and shafts lock tithing

365
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,470
schools be careful of me about it this

366
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,530
family of materials can cause cracking

367
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,109
in plastics so if you have plastic parts

368
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,170
nearby some plastic will crack being

369
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,810
exposed to vapor so being near that a

370
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,500
little bit careful and one other

371
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,390
all-around cheap and useful materials a

372
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,660
wax stick and this is used as a for

373
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,380
cutting like if you want to tap or

374
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,640
machine aluminum you just put a bit of

375
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,220
wax so they aluminum doesn't stick now

376
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,440
what this also allows you is to machine

377
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,350
aluminum with woodworking tools so if

378
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,940
you have a table saw and you put rocks

379
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,860
on the blade you can cut aluminum plates

380
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,650
if you have a router if you put wax on

381
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,540
the blade or wax on the piece you cut

382
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,670
you came out with a normal out of

383
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,440
aluminum sheets so it's a very useful

384
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,650
material to prevent to be a cutting

385
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,020
lubricant when you use mainly aluminum

386
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,130
but for other six - okay so let's talk

387
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,570
very quickly about Steel's the only hard

388
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,330
Nabal steel you need to keep in a shop

389
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,480
is a type known as air have an angle a

390
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,160
to the advantage of air hardening a to

391
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,800
steel or other hardenable steels is

392
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,470
double first you don't have to quench it

393
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,300
you just have to heat it and let it cool

394
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,090
and it hardens and the quenching puts a

395
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,400
lot of distortion in the steel and the

396
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,460
second reason is that a 2 is optimized

397
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,370
to have very very low dimensional change

398
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,250
after hardening like if you take a piece

399
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,350
of regular steel and your case hardened

400
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,580
it of you take

401
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,110
Stephen you harden it you can get

402
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,269
significant dimensional change which

403
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,940
means you have to grind away a lot

404
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,500
together you have to oversize it before

405
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,240
hardening and grind away a lot after

406
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,610
harming if you make it of a tool you can

407
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,769
make it practically net shape you don't

408
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,630
have to machine it after hardening maybe

409
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,779
you just have to grind a few spots now

410
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,580
this is sometimes you have to grind it

411
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,159
anyway because the very outer layer of

412
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,580
Steel decarburization you heat it up so

413
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,100
it loses hardness unless you have any

414
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,139
narrow atmosphere oven so it's a good

415
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:15,889
compromise

416
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:19,850
use a to steel when you harden it in an

417
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,730
oven you can wrap it in stainless foil

418
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,490
to prevent the carburizing the best

419
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,679
thing is you wrap it in paper first and

420
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,049
then in stainless foil and you seal the

421
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:32,600
stainless foil bag or spot where little

422
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,179
seal it so the little air which is

423
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:39,440
inside the oxygen will be absorbed when

424
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,490
the paper carbon Isis and this happens

425
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,190
before the steel loses carbon so if you

426
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,590
wrap it in paper the surface would not

427
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,120
be Cowboys so NASA steel which is useful

428
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,679
especially if dealing with medical

429
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,110
devices is 440 stainless steel 440 which

430
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,630
is a hard neighbour stainless it's not

431
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,510
as corrosion resistant as the 300 series

432
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,000
for example you cannot leave it in the

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,309
body as implants but they use it for

434
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,039
surgical tools and it hardens the same

435
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,630
as a tool you just heat it up let it

436
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,950
cooled fast and we'll see it in a minute

437
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,870
another common steel is high speed steel

438
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,179
where all your cutting tools the rails 3

439
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:24,590
miles everything is made of that

440
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,600
sometimes if you have to do some cutting

441
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,179
tool you can take a piece of high speed

442
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,010
steel and I just grind it you cannot

443
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,799
anneal it you can just grind it and the

444
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,620
eyes of Steel is regular carbon steel

445
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,470
which is the cheapest hardenable steel

446
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,289
but as I said you have to quench it and

447
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:44,360
there's a lot more knowledge needed so

448
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,059
it's not so recommended the problem is

449
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:49,010
if you got some all mixed up how to take

450
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,450
it terms of a path it all looks the same

451
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,380
the easiest way to tell them apart is by

452
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,990
test you just hold it to a grinder and

453
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,300
look at the sparks so we'll do this here

454
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:06,130
okay if you say regular mild feel the

455
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,020
sparks look like this so regular might

456
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,170
feel as very few sparks and they don't

457
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,900
have a star at the end of the spa

458
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,650
there is no star if you take carbon

459
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,870
steel same test with a lot more star and

460
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,190
the end of the stars where is a star

461
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,760
okay if your face 18 it looks like a

462
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,700
different type of star it's female

463
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,060
and no star the watch which is carbon

464
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,640
sphere

465
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,340
and this is AC so AC has val-kill down

466
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,250
to Paulo sparks female and most are now

467
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,179
high streets feel that even darker far

468
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:02,970
almost as possible possibly most article

469
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,270
and the few sparks are very dumb like

470
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,070
Moo hidden right there other than right

471
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:14,490
and the surgical stainless the 440 there

472
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,419
no sparks at all the basically is hard

473
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,580
to tell the high speed steel from the

474
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,659
surgical stainless

475
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,330
but still the high speed steel sparks

476
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,730
just a little bit more but it's very

477
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,690
easy to tell the surgical stainless from

478
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:43,620
the regular a tool regular a - okay so

479
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,870
let's just talk quickly about hardening

480
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,510
is the best way to harden speeds is of

481
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,970
course in a keel and oven but sometimes

482
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,740
you have just a little piece to be

483
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,690
hardened and you can do it very quickly

484
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,580
with a torch it's the same way as if you

485
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,720
had a little piece to braise you

486
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,550
wouldn't bother to put in and kill and

487
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,890
you just heat it up with a torch so the

488
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,210
most important thing when you heat

489
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,480
things up with a torch is to put some

490
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,000
ceremony insulator behind the piece you

491
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,250
heat up because this reflects back the

492
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,100
heat and prevents the heat from escaping

493
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,990
so basically it's twice as fast or heat

494
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,090
something up if you put a piece of fire

495
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,510
break or thermal insulator behind it

496
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,170
okay so here's a piece of a to steel and

497
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,420
in soft and I can tell it's off because

498
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,590
I can file it you don't you can hear

499
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,210
just the noise you can see it cuts

500
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,570
nicely it's a file so all that I have to

501
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,330
do to harden it is get it to white-hot

502
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,200
and let it cool down in a or a and I'm

503
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,910
here it may cool down a bit too slowly

504
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,280
because it's insulated so I just move it

505
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,660
away a little bit after happening so let

506
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:58,220
me just get tweezers ready okay now a

507
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,650
the nominal temperature for hardening

508
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,700
this is 950c which is white-hot it's not

509
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,950
so critical if you don't get it exactly

510
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,990
right so you build yourself like a

511
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,410
little fairness maybe maybe even with

512
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,750
the cover so then the heating will be in

513
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,320
faster

514
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,210
and if I wanted to graze between the say

515
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,509
all of you now if you take a piece of

516
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:44,210
steel and the desperate away

517
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,790
that's it okay at this stage after it

518
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,610
cooled down it's fully harmed you could

519
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,130
actually heal the file the sliding on it

520
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,900
is not capable of filing at all matter

521
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,820
of fact it's as how does a file so you

522
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,020
shouldn't do it too much okay so

523
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,500
damaging the file now however at this

524
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,860
stage it is brittle brittle meaning or

525
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,080
if I will hit it hard with a hammer it

526
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,150
will share them so you need to do a

527
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,790
second stage called tempering which is a

528
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,810
trade-off between hardness and toughness

529
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,240
so for example if I didn't do the

530
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,760
tempering I have a little notch here so

531
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,290
it'd probably be quite easy to break

532
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,860
because it's completely brittle there

533
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,840
are no strengths at all it was very hard

534
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,390
but I could break it easily so in order

535
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,110
to temper it you heat it to anywhere

536
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,650
between 250 C to 300 C depending on the

537
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,370
trade of you want 250 C will will keep

538
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,730
it at hardness of awkward RC 60 which is

539
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,610
basically that's how this you need for

540
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,430
almost any application if you need it's

541
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,430
something to be to have impact strength

542
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,470
then you have to heat it a bit more to

543
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,730
300 C then you go down to awkward 56 C

544
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,380
or something like Z but you have much

545
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,050
better toughness so that's their age

546
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,080
basically 220 to 300 so and every ten

547
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,790
degrees makes a big difference so you

548
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,740
have to be able to judge the temperature

549
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,420
of course you can do it in an oven

550
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,100
accurately but if you want to do it

551
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,080
quick and dirty with a torch like we did

552
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,480
it here you will judge the temperature

553
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,600
by the color luckily steam has a very

554
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,940
nice color change in this range it we

555
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,390
need it goes from straw Collier say it

556
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,280
around 220 it goes to sue Browns who

557
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,130
very dark blue to light blue which is

558
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,590
about 300 C so first I'll show you the

559
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,709
color change just to get an idea so

560
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,220
Oh

561
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:58,050
so this is varkala if I check unit 796

562
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,170
while he was a bit more because he feels

563
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,360
down very quickly okay so here it is 200

564
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,210
and that's just to store power if I go a

565
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,620
bit dark here like dark blue there's a

566
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,550
dark blue it says to faulty it's

567
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,320
actually a bit more again because as

568
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,060
soon as I move the curvature way the

569
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,490
temperature drops this dark blue is

570
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:29,030
actually 2 7 3 and if I keep heating it

571
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:34,730
the light blue it says we selfie but

572
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:40,010
that's already overheated so so if I

573
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,170
look at this piece and I look at the

574
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,930
color gradation I can see Stahl dark

575
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,660
blue light blue and this was overheated

576
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,190
already it went gray so that's

577
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,920
overheated so the tempering range is

578
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,800
straw to dark blue so dark blue is if a

579
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,520
rock will say 56 55 I could see strong

580
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,120
shock will see 60 okay so say we want to

581
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,880
temper this piece for full hardness or

582
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,420
temper it to straw color a small flame

583
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,670
in order not to overheat it's very very

584
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:21,170
critical okay very small flame and just

585
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,870
keep moving so in order not to overheat

586
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,739
one spot

587
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:45,360
and that's it remember if the part had

588
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,390
an asymmetric shape say if the part

589
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,540
looked like this and this was seen and

590
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,940
this was sick I would direct most of the

591
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,760
heat of the torch to the sick part

592
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,590
because otherwise this will overheat so

593
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,420
I just very carefully watch how much

594
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,600
mass I have and play with a touch longer

595
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,770
on the heavier sections okay so this is

596
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,910
now light straw so it's full hardness we

597
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,660
can verify that you can run a file on it

598
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,690
actually you can hear by the sound that

599
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,180
the file doesn't even bite into it don't

600
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,370
overdo it because you damage the file it

601
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,760
says how does a file one one useful

602
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,820
thing here is sometimes if you want to

603
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,800
make some cutting tool like a homemade

604
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,010
trail or homemade cutting tool is you

605
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,520
can braise a piece of carbide from some

606
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,910
discarded carbide insert to a stem of

607
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,790
mild steel and you do it just like the

608
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,710
brazing you've seen before with a setup

609
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,930
like that you put a piece of carbide on

610
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,630
it a bit of flux a piece of brazing

611
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,430
alloys heats the whole thing up and then

612
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,110
you have a carbide tip which is quite

613
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,270
useful it's very useful if you make to

614
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,980
make yourself special - really special

615
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,460
size please

616
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,639
you

617
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,510
shaped cross section if you

618
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,810
glass

619
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,250
you

620
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,600
so now what we'll do is

621
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,910
see that it maintain its v-shaped

622
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,570
perfectly

623
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:59,220
you

624
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:57,100
very esoteric use but if you

625
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,110
need this kind of prismatic shapes

626
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:04,560
squares triangles a spheric lenses it's
