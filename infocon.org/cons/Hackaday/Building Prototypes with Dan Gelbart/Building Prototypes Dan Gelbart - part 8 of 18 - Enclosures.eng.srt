1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,470
so now we are going to do a complete and

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,780
closure from beginning to end

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,470
step-by-step so assuming the it's

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,230
already designed you download the design

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,850
in a or D file or you download it in a

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,400
DXF file and you convert it here to an

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,000
over v5 we have the file we clamp the

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,239
material down we have to enter the

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,350
material thickness we set the height

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,100
typically a set too high

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,070
you bring it to touch the material and

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,140
you go half a team rocket now

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,220
sent it for the beginning this

14
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,810
flooded

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,690
okay so now it's finished

16
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,630
so first thing you want is to break the

17
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,090
sharp edges just to protect your fingers

18
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,270
and also that things will life will lay

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,770
flat around especially here when you cut

20
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:48,930
patterns like this it's rough okay so we

21
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,200
have the part cleaned up it was a little

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,750
arrow I made here in the file and you

23
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,940
can see there's an extra cut here which

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,340
is needed so that's a good opportunity

25
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,979
to show how to repair mistakes with a

26
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,899
spot well there because sometimes you

27
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,880
saw in an extra hole you didn't need or

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,610
misplaced whole or cut so no need to

29
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,830
scrap the part and wait another seven

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,070
minutes but you can fix it with that so

31
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,890
the trick in fixing it he always put an

32
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,160
older size piece slightly oversized

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,760
piece above the defect and then you just

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,799
melt it into the hole with the spot

35
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:31,980
welder in this case since it's an extra

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,580
slot there I just cut a strip which is a

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,769
little bit wider than the slot maybe by

38
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,980
half a millimeter or a millimeter

39
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,470
set it fairly high setting because it's

40
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,090
a big area I'm going to melt it over a

41
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,010
big area so set it like a number eight

42
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,790
this is the extra little piece I cut out

43
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,990
so

44
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,590
I made above the defect

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,910
that's it it's melted in fixed so now

46
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,670
the only thing left to do is cut it off

47
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,040
okay and just touch up your corner and

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,660
that's it normal defect okay you want to

49
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,750
be a perfectionist you can even send a

50
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,820
bit on top site will show up after

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,000
painting so if you want to plug the hole

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,280
the plug doesn't even have to be round

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,890
you can cut a square plug which is just

54
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,840
a bit bigger than the hole the high

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,390
current it's just flowing melted flowing

56
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,790
it just has to be a bit more metal than

57
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,350
the whole so it will always over feel it

58
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,910
so you can send off you know always want

59
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,890
to overfill so you can send off the

60
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,140
excess and if you can do a close-up here

61
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,070
on this you can see that it completely

62
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,580
melts and fills a hole okay the next

63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,740
thing we do we put in the bends and the

64
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,410
thing to do when to put in the bends is

65
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,500
two very very important things the first

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,540
thing is you have to sink through the

67
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,269
order of bends because some part can

68
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,459
only be bent in one order otherwise the

69
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,520
Chairman the machine so for example this

70
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,000
thing the edges have to be bent up and

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,370
then you have to have two bends here so

72
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,320
when you make this tube and here

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,750
the die has to fit between the burnt-up

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,580
edges okay

75
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,850
now the alternative if you do it the

76
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,919
other way you can't bend it if you bend

77
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,500
these fails and you get a you you cannot

78
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,870
come in and bend the lips so you have to

79
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,760
look at the plow take a deep breath and

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,850
figure out the order of bits now the

81
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,410
second thing which is very very

82
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,640
important unless the party symmetric you

83
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,229
have to bend it either on this side or

84
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:59,570
this side but you'll get a mirror image

85
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,090
and that is the most common mistakes

86
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,890
that you look at it bend it and then you

87
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,600
realize the mirror image and there's a

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,910
lot of straightening to do so you think

89
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,190
so what do you want you want the box it

90
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,830
ends up like this on switch on this side

91
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,580
so you want to bend up this way okay you

92
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,729
so and we'll Bend fair's periphery and

93
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,740
then we'll make these two bends because

94
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,390
that's the only order you can bend this

95
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,590
part okay

96
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,710
the width is more than the height or

97
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,210
will be no problem bending you don't

98
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,669
need any special tricks these are 15

99
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,680
millimeters so we Bend the periphery

100
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,800
first

101
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,460
exposition we set it to 15 double check

102
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,080
good double check the orientation good

103
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,620
now okay so we bend these bands first

104
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,260
now before I decide what should I bend

105
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,389
first should I bend the two long lines

106
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,800
first or the short ones first so I look

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,169
which tooling I have because once I Bend

108
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,090
one pair I need a tool which fit in

109
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,530
between okay so if I bend those edges

110
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,930
first I need a tool this long to fit in

111
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,710
between and I actually have one a bit

112
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,889
shorter if I bend these first I need to

113
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,510
tool this long and I have one here which

114
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,979
is a bit too long so it's no good so and

115
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,740
yeah so I'm better off actually bending

116
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,150
the short ones first because this tool

117
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,990
is closer to the length of the unit okay

118
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:48,080
so bent sharp on sale

119
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,430
it is right-angle it's good

120
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,120
okay hey now I'll bend the two long ones

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,060
and for that I have two segments open

122
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:25,100
heels a segmentation like this just like

123
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:34,820
this move this over okay and this is a

124
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,610
little bit too short but in a segment

125
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,150
like this it'll be close enough

126
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,560
that's good little bit closer now you

127
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,790
don't have to worry about this little

128
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,190
gap it will Bend it nicely in spite of

129
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,290
the little gap and you can always go

130
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,480
over it twice they move it a bit and go

131
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,230
over it twice in this place so you try

132
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,020
to spread those as much as it will allow

133
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,380
you to get a more accurate for West

134
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,560
Point so this will go in like this

135
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,680
that's almost exact do it carefully

136
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,679
check it a bit more pressure because

137
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,289
it's a wider strip actually could use a

138
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,039
bit more pressure

139
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,270
okay yeah that's good

140
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,019
okay okay now I can put in these bands

141
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,680
which I needed heal and again I don't

142
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,139
have the right weights I'll have to make

143
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:13,149
the shop and it doesn't have to be

144
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,339
accurate as you can see here although

145
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,709
this had a gap if you look at the band

146
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,459
you don't notice any problem I can feel

147
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,550
it just just my new thing here so define

148
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,860
my perfection is like an eye on out on

149
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,579
another segment section say if I wanted

150
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,310
to or I can just reverse it for that

151
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:39,129
matter doesn't fit so if I I wanted to I

152
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:42,279
could iron out is my new signature by

153
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,259
putting it here but barely perceptible

154
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:48,129
okay now I have to bend those okay so

155
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:55,709
you have to set up some segments but now

156
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,189
before I bend it up I notice that I have

157
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:04,110
here to waive rivet - with knot or two

158
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,269
threads insert I need to put in it's

159
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:09,490
much easier to spot well the mean before

160
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,160
I bend it although I could do it it sure

161
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,630
it will fit into the spot well they're

162
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,329
even bent but it's much is this way so

163
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:19,120
this point I'll stop when the two knots

164
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,889
and finish bending

165
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,009
so now we'll Bend these two bends and we

166
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,370
are done

167
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,850
okay it's not perfectly square you can

168
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,430
still flex it a bit exist and now we

169
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,400
have to bend the cover to exactly fit

170
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,220
over it now when you bend the cover and

171
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,370
if you want it to fit well you have to

172
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,040
allow for the material thickness and the

173
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,740
bend radius and thousand other things

174
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,590
which are too complicated so what you do

175
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,050
is much simpler than you've had to have

176
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,220
there you always cut a test strip

177
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,530
exactly the same width as a cover

178
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,480
because it's got the same sheet now you

179
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,450
calculate on the kid and some programs

180
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,910
will exactly calculate it for you for

181
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,800
example like solid walls sheet metal

182
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,990
option will calculate for you and tell

183
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,570
you where to put the bends so you put in

184
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,000
the number they tell you and do a test

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,770
friend and see if it fits and then you

186
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,900
adjust the number and this way only ways

187
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,790
to answer it instead of wasting all

188
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,680
cobble

189
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,780
so the calculations at 92

190
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,709
okay

191
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,639
when you fit it over this and it's close

192
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,690
but not perfect so the factor would be

193
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,839
what would be to tight a fit okay and

194
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,880
that's the whole purpose of this you

195
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,259
look at the arrow the arrow is actually

196
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,209
like two millimeter almost so you make

197
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,720
it ninety one on each side if you're not

198
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:13,350
sure you can use the same stuff that's

199
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,069
it again

200
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,699
you

201
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,790
a bit tight but that's because this is

202
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,489
not really a 90 degree Bend you can see

203
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,989
it's a bit open this lady should be

204
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:41,360
squeezed in a bit otherwise if it

205
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,910
wouldn't look nice so because otherwise

206
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,819
the cover will leave a little gap here

207
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:51,439
so just to make the cover fit more

208
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,720
perfectly since this was not quite 90

209
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,540
degrees just push it down a little bit

210
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,299
you never hang on the sheet metal

211
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,309
directly otherwise they'll make Dancy

212
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,489
always put some sweater like this and I

213
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,739
will check out the cover will fit yeah

214
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:24,079
and now the cover fits perfectly and

215
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,720
there is no gap here now another thing

216
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,910
you always do with sheet metal you never

217
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,910
make the cover reach out this much to

218
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,499
the end because then you get a sharp

219
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,129
edge

220
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:36,529
you always reset the cover a couple of

221
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,540
millimeters so you get the rounded edge

222
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,540
of the band and then you get to cover so

223
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,790
this way there's no sharp edge support

224
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,470
of the sharp edge is not only cutting

225
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,179
yourself the problem is a paint with

226
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,100
always cheap from a sharp edge so to

227
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,429
look ugly so you always recess it so if

228
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:53,869
you hit something it hits it on the

229
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,360
rounded corner so now we know the cover

230
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,279
is good now we bent the carving

231
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,900
again it's left hand in the right hand

232
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:25,200
you stop and think okay okay and now if

233
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,790
we look here covers it exists way and it

234
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,740
should pose to fit perfectly and it's

235
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
supposed to be a bit shorter and it does

236
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,070
and you can see here you get the right

237
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,140
edge now this is a bit flimsy as you can

238
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,390
see it's not exactly and so a good idea

239
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,480
is to adjust it exactly to be a right

240
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,300
angle and spot with a couple of braces

241
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,370
in cause you got this nothing to do with

242
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,700
it anyway so you cut it into four pieces

243
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:07,560
okay you set up from number four or

244
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,839
number three because we already did this

245
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,910
test before with the sickness of metal

246
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,820
we know the sickness now what you do is

247
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,910
you put in four bases like this but you

248
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,460
will Dhoni one side because you have to

249
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,520
adjust it for right angles you put the

250
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,620
braces underneath and these voices are

251
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,690
not so important but the cover will hold

252
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,430
it anyway but just if you want the extra

253
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,330
stiffness you put it in so the next step

254
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,600
is we welded the braces at one side so

255
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,790
next step is to bend it exactly to a

256
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,030
square against a square and well the

257
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,290
other side of each brace

258
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:24,419
okay and now if we try the cover if we

259
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,459
try the cover everything should line up

260
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:32,850
now so this is the front of the box will

261
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,700
fit beautiful me

262
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,530
okay the school's lineup everything is

263
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,620
good now a couple of things to note

264
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,580
first to make the cover not retro right

265
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,580
it's a good idea to always buy us a

266
00:17:47,580 --> 00:18:02,510
cover a little bit too tight now

267
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,370
yeah so now the cover is first against

268
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,950
this now a couple of things I want to

269
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,450
point out here before we continue

270
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,180
because you want to take advantage of

271
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,070
all the features of the waterjet

272
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,730
so for example when you cut a hole for

273
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,090
the toggle switch you cut the little key

274
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,060
and I put something right behind it so

275
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,710
you can see and if you can see that this

276
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,970
has a little key

277
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,610
and this key lines up with a slotted

278
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,120
switch same thing when you plug into the

279
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,300
core of the leaf the hole at the back is

280
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,480
double D shaped it's not around because

281
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,340
most of the things you buy have a

282
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,560
feature against rotation I call the

283
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,990
natural switches everything has a key so

284
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,310
when you cut with the waterjet you

285
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,550
always cut in the keys another thing you

286
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,170
can take advantage of the waterjet

287
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,630
if you are not sure about holes whether

288
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,000
you need them or not you can cut with

289
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,700
the waterjet knockouts knockout are the

290
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,620
same like in electrical boxes which are

291
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,300
holes which are not complete and you can

292
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,480
punch them out later it's much easier to

293
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,550
punch out at the side railing especially

294
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,680
when the box is assembled the way you do

295
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,690
a knock out say if I wanted a second

296
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,340
hole exists a knock out I would leave

297
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,340
two tabs holding the plug in place so I

298
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,620
can easily knock it out for example

299
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,900
if you zoom in here has a spare hole

300
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,140
just in case I need a knock out okay

301
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,790
that's important a sad thing to take

302
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,300
advantage is when you do the power you

303
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,240
think are going to be any little

304
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,810
brackets I need inside clamps for cables

305
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,270
little else brackets

306
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,790
cut them all out from the same sheet and

307
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,380
then they will get painted together and

308
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,330
everything fits so think of all the

309
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,700
little bits and pieces you need so for

310
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,420
example when this was cut out I already

311
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,830
knew I need a clamp for the cable so so

312
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,500
every big piece you'll need inside was

313
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,580
already laid out on the same sheet okay

314
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,770
now a second thing to keep in mind when

315
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,490
you design for waterjet is all the holes

316
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,610
in one plane will be perfectly

317
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,670
registered the machine is accurate about

318
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,650
1/10 of a millimeter so the holes would

319
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,020
be perfectly a distance the moment you

320
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,000
been do you lose the registration

321
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,310
because like the distance between these

322
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,070
two holes it's much less accurate

323
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,410
because it depends on how Square is a

324
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,530
band and it depends on the exact

325
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,630
material which is used up in the band so

326
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,670
it's very difficult to get registration

327
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:58,160
across band lines okay so say if I could

328
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,610
if I could would have been better to

329
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,460
make this box in a different way that

330
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,010
actually

331
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,220
the cover is will instead of two holes

332
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,470
across bands there will be two bands

333
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,230
this way into and say holes this way we

334
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,230
all hold this way which the distance

335
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,720
cannot be changed by bending but here

336
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,740
there's no choice

337
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,200
because I wanted to cover this way so I

338
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,330
had to suffer who the holes across band

339
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,330
lines Wichita Lance is less and indeed

340
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,730
it would like it a little bit longer

341
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,450
okay now another thing to keep in mind

342
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,620
when you bend if a hole is very close to

343
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,100
the band line it will become very ugly

344
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,200
because this is about as close you want

345
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
to keep to a bent line as imagine if

346
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,640
this edge was three millimeter and set

347
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,370
of ten millimeter it will twist and

348
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,250
distort instead of bending nicely and

349
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,990
it's for an especially true for a round

350
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,940
hole if you take a round hole put it

351
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,950
near a bend line it will get distorted

352
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,860
out of around so if you absolutely have

353
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,260
to put a round hole a hole at a bend

354
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,290
line make it like a u in a flat where

355
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,140
the flat lines I was a bend line because

356
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,910
the flat has already stays flat after

357
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,460
you bend but they don't make a round

358
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,590
hole touching a band line because it'll

359
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,670
be stopped so anything I really want to

360
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,530
stay ten millimeter away with any

361
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,680
openings from a band line here actually

362
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,900
worked okay same reason here if you want

363
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,720
an opening I left a good fifteen

364
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,730
millimeter to the band line to avoid any

365
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,060
distortion okay so that's about all that

366
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,630
you need now then you have to go and put

367
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,480
in all the studs and nuts you need

368
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,550
inside before you send blast and pain

369
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,190
okay so let's say we need here two nuts

370
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,910
and two studs

371
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,090
I'll put some in

372
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,779
okay

373
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,290
it's have done setting of age

374
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,510
remember the nuts and start always take

375
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,850
a much longer duration than just a weld

376
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,560
because the area is larger

377
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:37,029
also remember that after you paint you

378
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:39,789
can no longer spot well paint is an

379
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:41,769
insulator even if you scrape off the

380
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:43,330
paint you still need contact from the

381
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,369
other side so better think twice so what

382
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,769
I did the places I needed studs

383
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:53,139
okay I'm using standard round head

384
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:56,590
schools studs so what I did is I drill

385
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,440
the hole with the waterjet so I can feel

386
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,889
where the head is okay this way because

387
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,960
it doesn't have this little sharp tip so

388
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,149
I need to make a bigger hole so I can

389
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:10,619
just by feel know where it fits like

390
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,029
this I can feel a click or the hole

391
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:15,629
falls in

392
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,649
I can't over stress the importance of

393
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:31,519
captive hardware in electronic assembly

394
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,950
because the more captive the hardware is

395
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,559
the less chances of a school falling and

396
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,440
shorting out the whole circuit board so

397
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,909
everything which could be captive you

398
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:44,279
have to sink ahead and put it in okay so

399
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,379
we put in all the captive hardware

400
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:49,679
everything fits okay next step is

401
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,639
sandblasting okay everything fits that's

402
00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:00,649
about the right time to turn on the oven

403
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,210
okay

404
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,810
there

405
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:23,168
and the next thing is sandblasting okay

406
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,700
so the next step is just make sure

407
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,950
everything is ready for paint so any

408
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,379
place you don't like paint on you have

409
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:40,239
to cover is it with a silicon rubber

410
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,869
cube or mask with captain tape which can

411
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:46,179
take the temperature so I just don't

412
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:49,090
want paint on these two studs and

413
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,379
sometimes you want to cover them in

414
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,149
before sandblasting if you don't want

415
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,850
them too often up the rest nuts you

416
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,350
don't worry because you have to go to

417
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,059
the threads anyway to clean them out

418
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:02,830
don't worry about paint you make a

419
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,700
couple of hangers hang the part and the

420
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,259
same hang it would be used to hang it

421
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:12,370
inside but you hang it in a way

422
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,070
you want to hang it in a way that you

423
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,050
don't see any signature from the hand

424
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,500
girl so what I do is I do it like this

425
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,770
so now the pathway hanger is touching

426
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,840
it's not it's invisible and make it

427
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,770
shorter like this that is one

428
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,540
interestingly you cannot reuse the

429
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,610
hangers because the hangers are supposed

430
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,010
to ground it once they get powder-coated

431
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,970
you can only use them

432
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:48,700
this one we can get this like this cake

433
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,619
and we get everything ready here to put

434
00:26:53,619 --> 00:27:02,049
it in the oven of everything okay

435
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:05,820
well paint it white

436
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,900
now the nominal procedure for painting

437
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,360
is to put in the oven for about five

438
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,950
minutes at 235 cells use which about 380

439
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,520
F after 5 minutes a paint flowed and

440
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,080
then you're supposed to drop the

441
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,230
temperature from 2:30 to 190 C which

442
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,340
will be about less than 350 F and leave

443
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,710
it for another 15 minutes so the total

444
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,050
cycle is 20 minutes if you don't want to

445
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,150
bother you can leave it the whole cycle

446
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,680
at 2:30 or 2:35 but the paint will

447
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,440
yellow a little bit which is not all bad

448
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,810
because white terms it's a very light

449
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,430
beige which is actually quite beautiful

450
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,000
so as it is a color becomes one shade

451
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,300
warm since for most stuff we are not

452
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,850
into color signs a lot so you can just

453
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,690
put it in 275 C leave it for 20 minutes

454
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,170
and that's it the reason why you need to

455
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,690
leave it after it flowed is it has to

456
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,210
crosslink so hardness comes from the

457
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,910
chemical cost linking especially on this

458
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,220
one which is epoxy and if you don't

459
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,110
leave it a full term which will look the

460
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,340
same at the paint will be soft

461
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:29,379
okay now for inside corners you may want

462
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:31,899
to reduce the voltage so the

463
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:34,239
electrostatic field has less shielding

464
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:36,849
so first we'll start with the inside

465
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:42,389
corners maybe at 15 kilo volts

466
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,510
okay and we can do the rest

467
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,120
maybe any anything from twenty to fifty

468
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,169
kilovolt is fine

469
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:11,960
the reason why there's so much overspray

470
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,240
here is because everything here is metal

471
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,529
which shouldn't be because that's

472
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,840
actually welding Cornell so everything

473
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,390
is metal so the electrostatic particles

474
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,220
are attracted to everything not just to

475
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,990
the work piece if you have a proper

476
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,110
enclosure made of nonmetal all the

477
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,580
powder will go just for the truth

478
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:39,929
excited

479
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,410
okay

480
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,070
again in the proper enclosure this will

481
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,250
be hanging on a rotating shaft so it

482
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,310
will slowly rotate this is free you

483
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,179
wouldn't have to turn it around

484
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,350
you

485
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,170
okay good enough

486
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,200
I just want to make sure how they

487
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,700
reached below yeah and one look around

488
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,510
if it reached this

489
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:32,389
we hang it in the oven as I said in this

490
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:37,419
case we just leave it at 275 or 380 F

491
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:42,159
roughly for 20 minutes and that's done

492
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,820
if you touched it by mistake the powder

493
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,649
will come off either way so you just

494
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,009
overspray it with a bit of powder even

495
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:55,480
after its painted if there's a defect

496
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,580
you can overspray and hang it back in

497
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,090
the oven

498
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,080
okay

499
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,330
this whole apparent mess cleans up

500
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,799
instantly with a vacuum cleaner

501
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,840
schools around here for a minute

502
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,919
so you can see it's off-white now it

503
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:33,140
went one shadow towards beige because I

504
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,570
didn't drop the temperature but that's

505
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,559
okay because who cares okay so now it's

506
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,750
all cooled down out of the oven

507
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,779
everything ready last step is you take

508
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:49,510
off this protector for threads

509
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,370
as you remember these protectors have to

510
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,470
be silicone rubber or a captain tape

511
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,649
otherwise infusion be trouble and one

512
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:05,990
last step to go over the threads because

513
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,120
the threads are dirty both from the spot

514
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,999
welding and the painting so you just

515
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:14,059
have to go over them with the tape at

516
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,220
the talk so it doesn't break the tape if

517
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,299
something bad happens

518
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:37,590
good okay now now putting the mounting

519
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,980
schools

520
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:51,730
then tie the car before feet cover goes

521
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:57,760
this and then like this okay erotic fate

522
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,190
and main thing is you can slide it off

523
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,210
without removing the schools I cannot

524
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,310
overemphasize how important it is to

525
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,710
make everything with keyholes and sloths

526
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,160
and captive hardware because if you

527
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,200
spend all your life in R&D

528
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,960
you'll spend about one year of your life

529
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,600
taking schools out of covers so if you

530
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,270
do it in slots it's the same as

531
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,730
extending your life at the same amount

532
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,980
as health food plus exercise extend your

533
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,610
life it's much simpler okay so here it

534
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,080
is ready to go
