1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,820
okay the next machine you need is a

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,139
sandblaster and

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,429
very useful tool

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:18,189
if you want to born things with

5
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:20,500
adhesives or if you want to paint things

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,410
the only way to give auntie a really

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,529
good bond is to send plaster surface we

8
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:27,910
talked a little bit more about it when

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,090
you talk about painting so a these are

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,489
very simple devices the only

11
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:35,650
modification I recommend doing is

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,379
replacing the window with a diamond

13
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:41,199
coated window like I did here because a

14
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,300
problem is sandblaster the ways are made

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,160
they have a glass window and a

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,159
protective plastic because a grid will

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,440
cut the glass right away and the

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,780
protective plastic is replaced every few

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,159
days because it gets hazy from the grid

20
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,559
opaque so it's a lot of maintenance to

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,290
constantly replace a protective plastic

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,989
now you can buy these glass panels which

23
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,990
are diamond coated and they're useful

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,460
supermarkets can have checkout they

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,890
don't scratch from the product and they

26
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,030
cost about maybe 20 bucks each but they

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,460
last a lifetime so I had this here for

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,620
many years and now as good as new

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,990
and it's important to be able to see

30
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,850
when you sandblast what you are doing

31
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,730
to make sure everything is cleaned up so

32
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,320
the operation is self evident

33
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,570
live inside

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,829
up here okay

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,570
this one has a vacuum which is a good

36
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,610
thing so when you open it there's no

37
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,280
dust inside and also you can see better

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,060
so you can see the effect where it was

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,369
sandblasted

40
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,920
okay so this is a painting and welding

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,400
area before we get into painting let's

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
talk a little bit about surface

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,700
preparation so the paint or adhesive

44
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,000
sticks to the metal by a combination of

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,120
a mechanical and chemical effect so

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,099
mechanically with roughness on the

47
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,680
surface it looks in mechanically but a

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,569
lot of the bonding comes from mechanical

49
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,760
effect some feet through the surface

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,310
energy which is released of the surface

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,220
some of it's a - chemical bonding like

52
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,400
for example when you glue when you bond

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,980
glass with silicon rubber adhesives and

54
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,959
so on you in and some adhesive you form

55
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,410
a tool bond and get a tenacious bond so

56
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,959
we talk separately about bonding so

57
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,209
let's just talk about painting so there

58
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:03,190
is the classical way which say talking

59
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,500
books about preparing a surface or

60
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,019
painting is completely useless because

61
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,630
all the books say clean it with a

62
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,530
solvent or rb2 sandpaper and the reason

63
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,380
why it's useless is if you clean

64
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,810
something with a solvent no matter how

65
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,609
much you wash it with a solvent you just

66
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:25,180
dilute the hydrocarbons or the oils so

67
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,609
it's an end so it's always a mono lay of

68
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:30,100
left because the mono layer will say one

69
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,560
molecular layer of hydrocarbons and this

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,560
is enough to prevent a chemical bond and

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,569
if the surface is very smooth and

72
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,860
there's no chemical bond say

73
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,520
the paint will not hold the standard

74
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,910
test for paint adhesion is a tape peel

75
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,910
of test and the way it's done you have

76
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,190
to find a very strong tape like the

77
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,610
strongest duct tape you can find you

78
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,910
take the painted sample and you do a

79
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,190
crisscross with a knife

80
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,459
maybe 4x4 squares you put the tape on

81
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,389
and peel it off and if there is any

82
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,470
piece of paint lifted it failed okay now

83
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,780
this this tape isn't that strong and

84
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,070
this paint is not bad

85
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,590
so and because and this cell this

86
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,680
service was not prepared but if you it's

87
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,289
still borderline because for example if

88
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,979
you bend it if you bend it a bit and

89
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,419
then we'll repeat the test it looked

90
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,349
okay but it's actually not a very good

91
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:49,289
paint job because if I bend it a bit and

92
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,130
I repeat the peel of tests now it looks

93
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,960
bad

94
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,570
okay so what it means it's not a real

95
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,750
bond okay so if I do the same test which

96
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,849
actually I've done here so this has

97
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:06,780
already scratches in it and I can bend

98
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,340
it okay then I can do the same test as

99
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,409
many times as I want nothing will come

100
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,130
off okay so basically if you want a

101
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,320
really good paint job it has to be able

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,570
to pass the peel off test and especially

103
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,760
the peel of test after you bend it once

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,760
or twice okay now so if you just take

105
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,280
the material clean it and wash it in

106
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,530
sand its ending is better but they was

107
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,449
washing with solvent is pretty useless

108
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,630
because it still leaves a mono layer so

109
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,810
there is only two good ways to prepare

110
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,030
this actually three good ways to prepare

111
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,270
the surface it's absolutely best in SEM

112
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,000
plastic and as you always do that if you

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,210
can now sometimes you can't and the two

114
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,639
cases where you can't it's a the object

115
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,919
is too big just don't fit in the

116
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,009
sandblaster like you're the car to paint

117
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,250
okay

118
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,310
the second reason you can't if the sheet

119
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,500
metal is very very thin

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,110
because if any metal see nails and say

121
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,340
half a millimeter

122
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,850
if you send blast or completely stopped

123
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,400
the reason is the sandblasting will put

124
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,550
in its like shot PE if you put in

125
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,740
compressive strengths in one side and

126
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,350
the piece will immediately Bend if you

127
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,060
flip it over and send blasts the other

128
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,340
side it will straighten out but never

129
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,650
perfect so if something is made of very

130
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,380
thin material you cannot sandblast it

131
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,920
without distorting it so the next best

132
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,820
thing to sandblasting is either bluing

133
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,600
it bluing it is heating it to about 300

134
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,300
degree Celsius or scrubbing it with

135
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,670
these bathroom cleaners like Ajax or

136
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,910
comet and the reason is that these

137
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,430
bathroom cleaners activate the surface

138
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,230
and not only remove the oil actually

139
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,330
activate the surface because I also

140
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,430
oxidized and activate the surface

141
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,460
so the test to know if a surface is

142
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,790
ready for bonding or painting is it

143
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,370
called a wetting test so I'll show you

144
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,320
the effect if I take a piece of metal

145
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,760
and if I put a drop of water on it as a

146
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,470
water will bead okay that's just plain

147
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,860
water the water will so what they will

148
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,320
beat up so here you can see the water

149
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,160
drops not spreading but beating okay if

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,660
I do the same where I sandblasted when

151
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,190
the water wets

152
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,280
so here the drops just fall off here

153
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,580
they leave a wet completely wet a trace

154
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,900
another way of doing it if I put the

155
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,210
water and spread it with my finger here

156
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,720
and I tilt it so water just falls off

157
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,090
like from a duck if I do the same thing

158
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,120
here and spread it with my finger the

159
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,580
whole surface becomes wet and the water

160
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,370
doesn't fall over just spreads now the

161
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,430
angle between the edge of the drop of

162
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,550
water and the surface is called contact

163
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,150
angle and that is direct measurement of

164
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,700
the surface energy because if the

165
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,130
surface energy is high it will overcome

166
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,760
the surface tension of the water and

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,610
pull the water and spread it if the

168
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,080
surface energy is low

169
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,650
it will actually not open the water at

170
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,900
all and actually repel the water say if

171
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,020
its hydrophobic so if you don't get this

172
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,270
wedding you're wasting your time trying

173
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,160
to glue it or paint it

174
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,890
okay so how so we showed you so the

175
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,300
first way to get the wedding is

176
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,120
sandblasting now the second way is it

177
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,270
gets a wedding which is not as effective

178
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,090
as sandblasting but sometimes simpler to

179
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,730
do is heat everything to about 150 to

180
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,430
300 C and that's easy if you have a big

181
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,740
oven for painting which you need anyway

182
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,410
so you put in the oven before painting

183
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,350
heat it up spray paint it with a powder

184
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,090
as we will see and put it back to the

185
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,250
oven to Q so the equipment is there

186
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,500
anyway you may say heat it up it's a big

187
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,930
advantage of heating up an object before

188
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,450
painting so anything which can give you

189
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,850
bubbles or defects in pain will

190
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,350
disappear when the first round of

191
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,170
heating let's say I have a piece which

192
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,750
is well that dream that there is some

193
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,520
moisture trapped or there is some

194
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,000
cutting oil trapped in it if I

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,430
powder-coated break it this cutting oil

196
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,320
will bubble out and make the effect on

197
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,630
the paint but if I heated it up anyway

198
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,970
once before painting everything which is

199
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,250
volatile came out already so the paint

200
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,040
job is more likely to be perfect so you

201
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,870
can do both you can actually send blast

202
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,770
and heat up okay now if you heat up

203
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,960
steel is very easy because the steel

204
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,540
change its color so you know exactly by

205
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,210
the color of the temperature so you

206
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,970
usually do it in an oven but I just look

207
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,570
here quickly

208
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,939
you can see is a talent change

209
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,600
don't heat it up more than 3-hundred

210
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,850
because we don't want it to oxidize and

211
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,460
flake off we just want a very very thin

212
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,460
layer of oxide which is adherent you can

213
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,090
see here the water beads and falls off

214
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:58,810
here it to add sand stays now the set

215
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,410
method of preparation is scrub it as I

216
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,280
said with something like Ajax or comet I

217
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,930
know it looks like a comet commercial

218
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,090
basically take any one of these bathroom

219
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,780
cleaners the powder ones just scrub it

220
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,270
and rinse it off and I do a wetting test

221
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,920
again I get very good wetting I don't

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,210
know if you can see it in the picture

223
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,950
but the water spreads completely okay

224
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,560
because it activates the surface now as

225
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,420
a comparison if I do

226
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,380
so standard textbook solution and I take

227
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,160
a solvent

228
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,600
so say if I take acetone and I clean it

229
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,290
with acetone

230
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,630
and I do the wedding test to try the

231
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,310
wedding caste does not seek there's no

232
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,770
wedding okay so the difference is this

233
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,520
just dilute the hydrocarbons but still

234
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,720
it's a monolayer while the Ajax of the

235
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
comet of these things decompose them

236
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,350
attain just like soap does and multiply

237
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,810
so decomposes and oxidizes the residue

238
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,760
or whatever chemistry takes place and

239
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
leaves a surface with high surface

240
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,580
energy now a very important thing to

241
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,910
understand that all these effects the

242
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,190
wetting effect is appeared in about an

243
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,620
hour so if I come back to this piece

244
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,950
next day none of these will wet the

245
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,500
reason it's air is full of hydrocarbons

246
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,410
and by adsorption the hydrocarbon

247
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,110
molecules will recoat the item so

248
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,820
everything has to be painted within one

249
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,890
hour of activating the surface the same

250
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,750
for glue bonding or any operation

251
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,300
surface operation plating if an eco

252
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,820
plate if any operation to do a surface

253
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,410
bonding has to be done within one hour

254
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,500
of activating the surface now there's a

255
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,180
lot to protect itself as it's called

256
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,130
gummy if you have to clean a lot of part

257
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,790
one day and paint them the next day so

258
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,560
it's a solution called gumming solution

259
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,390
you can wash the part in and rinse them

260
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,670
of next day and it preserves surface

261
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,880
activation but it's not for prototypes

262
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,700
you just clean it before use for example

263
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,180
this piece that I did the test on was

264
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,390
glued and sandblasted yesterday

265
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,470
and I suspect that if I do the test here

266
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,050
on the blood pal

267
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,540
see it lost any ability to retain the

268
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,079
water what the water beats off and if I

269
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,970
spread it doesn't stay

270
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,399
while yesterday it walked perfect the

271
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,259
test shows and even the sandblasted

272
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,079
surface it's better than life itself has

273
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,050
retained most of the quality but not

274
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,139
quite see that the water doesn't fully

275
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,810
coated so this retained about half of

276
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,899
the magic this lost all the magic in one

277
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,310
day surface energy is a product of the

278
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,620
specific surface energy and the surface

279
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,740
area so you can have something with a

280
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,649
low specific surface energy but has a

281
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,079
highly structured surface so the total

282
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,629
surface area is very large because what

283
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,060
matters is a product so you can make

284
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,540
even take Teflon which is hydrophobic as

285
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,970
hell and you can make it hydrophilic by

286
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,160
texturing the surface enough that there

287
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,079
is so much surface area then when

288
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,269
multiplied by a low specific surface

289
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,490
energy still gives a big number so

290
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,800
that's a trick so the trick is why this

291
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,250
retains more is simply because what

292
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,170
matters is a product of the area and

293
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,689
this has much more areas in this that

294
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,129
set what doesn't it's not a mechanical

295
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,439
uncovering it's just its effect at the

296
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:55,209
area authority so after you prepared the

297
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:58,569
surface you will extra static reporter

298
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:04,029
and the best thing to do is the reason

299
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,120
why I suggest electrostatic painting is

300
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,089
because it's done with powder so there

301
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,730
is no cleanup issues because if you

302
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,860
paint it with wet paint which works fine

303
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,230
there's cleanup of wet paint which is a

304
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,940
problem so

305
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,030
what you need is to hang it from a

306
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:28,850
grounded surface say so if I if I wanted

307
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,540
to paint say this piece okay

308
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,510
what's its range this piece I have to

309
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,670
usually when you make the part of the

310
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,100
rot object if it has no holes you make

311
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,580
sure you leave one hole just to hang it

312
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:56,290
okay like this now way to go this way

313
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,880
now these systems are very very cheap

314
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,160
now you can buy a system now with

315
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,220
variable voltage for powder coating for

316
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,440
500 bucks or less and you can buy a

317
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,779
system without variable voltage for less

318
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,730
than 100 bucks it's very very cheap a

319
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,160
good supply of all these things as a

320
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,770
company called Columbia coatings the

321
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,860
website they're resilient colors

322
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,000
courtesy photo all the custom money

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,120
motorcycle manufacturers so they have

324
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,870
every color nails so

325
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,230
what I do is I buy many of the cheap

326
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,290
guns and keep each gun for one color I

327
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,660
never waste time brushing out the guns

328
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,270
okay this works on oil pressure like 10

329
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,960
psi now if you don't use electrostatics

330
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,450
the powder goes everywhere so if I push

331
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,300
you'll see the powder go everywhere not

332
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,440
necessarily to the workpiece if I turn

333
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,400
on the high voltage this is ground this

334
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,240
is a minus 30 kilo volt so the power

335
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,109
only goes to attitude it's just

336
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,839
attracted and the amazing thing is even

337
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,880
if you spray just a friend the powder

338
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,510
goes to the back - okay not solely but

339
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,579
if it's a narrow piece of powder will

340
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,709
fully cover the back because it goes

341
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,740
around the part of which message is put

342
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,370
back so even if I should hear what the

343
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,040
object the powder will be filled there

344
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,950
can cover the object so that's a very

345
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,630
very good way of painting provides many

346
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,280
many colors so one of the more

347
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,230
interesting paints you can buy is a

348
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,440
chrome paint which looks just a corn

349
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,800
plating and it's called durable so you

350
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,350
paint it

351
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,389
and when you paint it it doesn't look

352
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:57,880
like much but then when you put it in

353
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,700
the oven it turns into a chrome finish

354
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,610
so I just to do it fast I wouldn't put

355
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,320
in love and I'll just heat it up a bit

356
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,799
like this

357
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,020
so this is a calm helping out there but

358
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,970
as soon as you heat it after that I tend

359
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,820
to the chair

360
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,639
it fuses and tariffs like a calm finish

361
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,250
and if you look at this it gives you a

362
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,620
beautiful effect of chrome plating and

363
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,160
it's quite durable so there's just a

364
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,520
quick note on how to fix defects before

365
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,710
painting sometimes you make a sheet

366
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,630
methane closure and you got some dents

367
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,060
in the sheet metal especially you get a

368
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,100
lot of defects when you have to weld a

369
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,370
larger enclosure and you send off but

370
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,670
you still have some a dense four left

371
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,470
over from the welding you cannot send

372
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,070
out so the textbook solution is you buy

373
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,290
a special high temperature patching

374
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,200
compound which can tolerate the baking

375
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,870
temperature of the paint but it doesn't

376
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,620
work very well

377
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,200
a because it's weak be because it

378
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,500
discolours the paint and so altogether a

379
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,530
much better solution is use the paint

380
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,580
itself to fill a defect so what you do

381
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,730
is you heat up the part to about 230

382
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,040
degrees C the same temperatures for

383
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,700
painting and while the part is hot you

384
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,340
just sprinkle some powder from the same

385
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,550
powder used for painting into the defect

386
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,650
if the paint will melt and fill the

387
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:45,700
defects so let's do that so so I have

388
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,470
two boxes here which had to be welded so

389
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,790
what we do actually put them as a money

390
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,280
insulator so they stay hot long here and

391
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,060
close the oven so I send blasted it

392
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,950
before and now all what I do is I take

393
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,230
some of the same powder the paint powder

394
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,710
and whatever that I said and I split I

395
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,760
put in powder

396
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,100
it doesn't have to be accurate because

397
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,169
I'm going to send off the excess anyway

398
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:29,020
okay so the powder the powder melts okay

399
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,070
and just beautifully become solid epoxy

400
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,950
or whatever whatever it is yes there and

401
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,880
fills all the dents

402
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,760
okay so ready melted now we do the same

403
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,160
the powder not only males but cues

404
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,290
within a minute it will become rigid

405
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,100
check if it's all filled yeah and when

406
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,580
we finish we can just send off send it

407
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,320
flat okay so now we let the melted

408
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,470
powder cure for about a minute or two

409
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,180
and then we let the whole thing cool

410
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,610
down now once it cooled down we just

411
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,740
send it and all the defects will be

412
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,250
filled out

413
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:31,110
from now what you can see is a white

414
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,669
powder which mounted only stayed

415
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:40,020
wherever there was weather or dance okay

416
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,820
obviously I'm going to do it with the

417
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,860
same powder you are going to coat it

418
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,410
with because this way you guaranteed

419
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,150
there will be no color of show school
