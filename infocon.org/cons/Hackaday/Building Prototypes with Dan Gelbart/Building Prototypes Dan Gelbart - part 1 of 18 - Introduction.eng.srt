1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,139
hi I'm Dan Gilbert and that's a short

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,840
course on how to build stuff and the

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,390
course is mainly for students and

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,340
scientists researchers who are not

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,760
machinist by training which means the

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,460
emphasis in this course is how to build

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,619
things very quickly using equipment

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,680
which is very easy to master so

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,290
altogether it's not only it's applicable

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,120
not only to prototype it's also

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,059
applicable to some limited production

12
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:37,559
but the biggest benefit is for

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,610
prototyping and the enabling technology

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,430
which makes life so simple is water jet

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,430
cutting which we'll see in a few minutes

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,800
so all together what we'll cover first

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,750
is a basic setup in other words the

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,060
tools and the machines you need we'll

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,340
cover the modifications which is desired

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,260
to put into those machines to make them

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,660
even more productive and then we'll go

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,000
step by step and fabricate some parts

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
starting with a simple enclosure so

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,640
before we get into fabricating a part I

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,770
just want to show you the wide range of

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,289
things you can take advantage of water

27
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:15,869
jet cutting so obviously the thing which

28
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,079
is most common is enclosures starting

29
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,829
from very simple boxes like that if it's

30
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,479
for R&D work you try to make it with all

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,249
captive hardware in other word notice

32
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:31,469
there are no screws holding the cover

33
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,829
just snaps in place there is knockouts

34
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,859
cut in just like an electrical boxes to

35
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:40,139
avoid later on drilling wherever

36
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:44,189
possible it uses keyholes instead of

37
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,590
regular holes and this is a huge

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,539
time-saver not only because you don't

39
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,609
have to take the schools out to remove

40
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:53,880
it but also you avoid the common problem

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,939
of a school which is taken out falling

42
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,529
into some part of the machine where it

43
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,359
shouldn't typically falling into

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,009
something electrical and shorting the

45
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,889
works out so that's with the water jet

46
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:07,920
it comes at no cost the other thing you

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,929
can do in enclosures or parties a water

48
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,330
jet if you have to be very lightweight

49
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,380
and strong you can emboss them so

50
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,080
basically what you do

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,780
ribs were put in in one minute with a

52
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,260
die made on the waterjet basically the

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,870
die is made of two pieces but welded

54
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,240
together this is cut on the waterjet and

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,120
then you can put in the ribs make it

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,760
lighter something you'll notice in all

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,360
these boxes that I tend to design the

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,260
boxes that it's made of u-shaped pieces

59
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,160
instead of bending a piece on four sides

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,050
so in other word this box is made of a

61
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,050
big u and too little use which are spot

62
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,270
welded in now the reason why the

63
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,580
preference is to make everything of U

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,010
shaped pieces instead of like a flower

65
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,820
with four four pieces is u-shaped pieces

66
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,400
can be bent on the break without having

67
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,370
to move over the segment's if this was

68
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,100
bent from one piece I will have to

69
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,040
adjust the segment's to fit in and that

70
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,110
takes an extra couple of minutes to find

71
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,390
the right combination of break fingers

72
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,209
or break segments to fit in but if this

73
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,880
is a u I bend it with a full-length bar

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,830
I don't have to touch the break I don't

75
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,470
have to modify it so both this piece in

76
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,070
this p is the most of the boxes the best

77
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,269
thing is designed them from a

78
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,640
combination of use in general of course

79
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,070
you can't bend on a break something

80
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,269
which is too deep because they'll

81
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,750
interfere with a break now another thing

82
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,269
which is a natural for water jet cutter

83
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,320
is lectures so flexures can be either

84
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,209
monolithic and we're going to talk in

85
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,730
details later about them it could be

86
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,420
very tiny and I'll just hold it here so

87
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,180
you can see it these are a small if

88
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,980
lecture as you can actually make on a

89
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,160
water jet these were for fiber optics

90
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,000
and this little one as small as it is is

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,390
actually a 4x is position air it has X&Y

92
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,269
flexure movement and it has theta and

93
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,339
feet tilt at the back with two more sets

94
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,120
cause now you can also make Flex chairs

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,380
just from spring material like this

96
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
where everything is sheet metal the

97
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,950
middle part moves and these are spot

98
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,910
weld it's playing

99
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,060
which are spot welded in okay in this

100
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,520
case the springs and some of the Flex

101
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,050
chair in this case for sure this brings

102
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,660
out night in oil instead of steel in

103
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,870
order to get a very large elastic range

104
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,240
this is what's called a claw spring

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,300
hinge it acts like a normal hinge but

106
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,670
it's all spot welded with 19 or flex

107
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,340
chairs of course the advantage of these

108
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,550
flex chairs over slides that a there is

109
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,060
no whale be there is no lubrication see

110
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,730
there is no backlash and D you can make

111
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,410
in a few minutes instead of paying

112
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,470
hundreds of bucks for a slide so this is

113
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,280
a natural thing for a spot welder now

114
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,310
another thing which works well with the

115
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,870
water jet is very large structures where

116
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,610
this is just a sample and we'll talk

117
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,380
more about large structures this is a

118
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,680
1/10 model which we'll discuss later and

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
you can make quite complex assemblies

120
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,930
made from those elements and let me show

121
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,510
you a couple okay so here is a few more

122
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,390
examples of what you can fabricate using

123
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,300
the method shown in this course a very

124
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,040
simple thing you can fabricate on a

125
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,330
water jet is Springs all the way from

126
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,550
Springs carved from solid steel which

127
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,100
can be cut from the hard material or cut

128
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,290
in the annealed state in hardened

129
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,710
and these are Springs which need a few

130
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,169
hundred kilo to compress if you wanted

131
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,480
to wind them from wire probably a while

132
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,520
the diameter of a pencil which you make

133
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,910
it very hard to wind now you can go and

134
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,610
make very nice disc Springs like this

135
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,500
with a spiral and the two nice things

136
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,100
about these disc Springs is fair say go

137
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,220
completely flat when you compress it it

138
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,870
compresses to the thickness of the

139
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,140
material so they go completely flat

140
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,840
which means minimum clear ends so second

141
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,390
nice thing about those Springs that they

142
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,700
don't have to be constant K Springs

143
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,090
matter of fact if I cut a spiral with

144
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,760
the constant width the spring will not

145
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,789
be constant K because the outer spiral

146
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,920
will deflect more easier

147
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,110
the inner spiral so actually it'd be a

148
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,660
progressive cake if I wanted to make

149
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,240
this constant K I would linearly taper

150
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,480
down the spiral but that means that I

151
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,970
can take any plot of force versus

152
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,910
distance I want convert it to a spring

153
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,760
design and I can make an arbitrary K

154
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,620
function for the spring which is quite

155
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,540
convenient because sometimes you want

156
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,760
Springs which have a very wide dynamic

157
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,830
range they are affected by a little bit

158
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,270
of pressure but then they can hold

159
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,720
before bottoming out a big pressure so

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,450
the ability to make explain where the

161
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,240
case continuously programmable as a

162
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,670
function of distance at the same cost as

163
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,970
a regular spring is very nice other

164
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,190
things you do on a water jet is you

165
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,920
minimize machining if you need parts

166
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,660
which have to be very accurate beyond

167
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,060
the accuracy of the water jet obviously

168
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,920
you meet you you will water jet the

169
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,960
whole path to touch it up on a machine

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
but the way to do it is you water jet it

171
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,720
paint it and then clamp it and after

172
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,240
painting touch up the surfaces this is

173
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,490
much faster than the normal way of

174
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,760
masking this precision surfaces and then

175
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,650
painting and all is cleaning the

176
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,600
leftover paint because this way the

177
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,490
paint is tough enough to clamp in a vise

178
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,550
and do the machining another example

179
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,850
where 95% is done on the water jet and

180
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,830
5% just the rim is machined afterwards

181
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,010
now some stuff looks complicated but

182
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,800
actually is a combination of very simple

183
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,890
structures and exists as a sum gearbox

184
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,080
which rotates in two directions on two

185
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,720
axis but actually just made like simple

186
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,780
enclosures and the bearings are little

187
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,020
bearing mounds of just little inserts

188
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,280
permanently attached in this case with

189
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,100
schools to the housing just to give more

190
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,799
support of the bearings so this looks

191
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,350
like a complicated assembly but actually

192
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,900
it's built like enclosures the gearing

193
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,630
itself is done with timing belts inside

194
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,480
there's also some slip rings and again

195
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,610
note that everything is done with

196
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,430
captive hardware and tee and key holes

197
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,050
so you don't have to

198
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,170
of any schools to open it so it shows

199
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,300
you that even complex parts can be

200
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,670
broken down into a few simple assemblies

201
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,670
all of them made from spot-welded bent

202
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,029
metal and wherever you need a secure

203
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:18,089
section you can add it on a weld it on

204
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,980
and machine it after the whole thing is

205
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,329
finished now here is another example

206
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,839
this is some type of a chuck if you turn

207
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,230
this it flips the different diameters

208
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,610
now this looks like a completely

209
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,850
machined item but surprisingly there is

210
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,769
nothing machined in this whole thing

211
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:39,779
because everything is made from water

212
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,779
jet part this is a pipe and a ring

213
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,140
pressed together and even the scroll

214
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,100
inside which activates the arms the

215
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,269
skull inside is a water jet cut helix in

216
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,329
which a flexible steel strip is inserted

217
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,480
and advantage of this that the spring is

218
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,269
already hard and smooth and and if you

219
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,390
had to do it from one piece this piece

220
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,010
would have to be steel and then you

221
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,050
would have to grind it on a CNC grind

222
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,020
there in order to get good accuracy and

223
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,870
wear and that's quite a lot of work to

224
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,779
make it make it on steel harden it grind

225
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,720
it on the CNC grind there and a compared

226
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,149
to just inserting a Steel reborn in a

227
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,589
water jet cutter helix
